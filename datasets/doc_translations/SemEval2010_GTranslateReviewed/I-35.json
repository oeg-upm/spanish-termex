The distributed management of norms is a challenging issue and we observe a lack of truly distributed computational realisations of normative models. In order to regulate the behaviour of autonomous agents that take part in multiple, related activities, we propose a normative model, the Normative Structure (NS), an artifact that is based on the propagation of normative positions (obligations, prohibitions, permissions), as consequences of agents actions. Within a NS, conflicts may arise due to the dynamic nature of the MAS and the concurrency of agents actions. However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable. We show this by formalising the notion of conflict, providing a mapping of NSs into Coloured Petri Nets and borrowing well-known theoretical results from that field. Since online conflict resolution is required, we present a tractable algorithm to be employed distributedly. We then demonstrate that this algorithm is paramount for the distributed enactment of a NS.

INTRODUCTION A fundamental feature of open, regulated multi-agent systems in which autonomous agents interact, is that participating agents are meant to comply with the conventions of the system. Norms can be used to model such conventions and hence as a means to regulate the observable behaviour of agents [6, 29]. There are many contributions on the subject of norms from sociologists, philosophers and logicians (e.g., [15, 28]). However, there are very few proposals for computational realisations of normative models - the way norms can be integrated in the design and execution of MASs. The few that exist (e.g. [10, 13, 24]), operate in a centralised manner which creates bottlenecks and single points-of-failure. To our knowledge, no proposal truly supports the distributed enactment of normative environments. In our paper we approach that problem and propose means to handle conflicting commitments in open, regulated, multiagent systems in a distributed manner. The type of regulated MAS we envisage consists of multiple, concurrent, related activities where agents interact. Each agent may concurrently participate in several activities, and change from one activity to another. An agents actions within an activity may have consequences in the form of normative positions (i.e. obligations, permissions, and prohibitions) [26] that may constrain its future behaviour. For instance, a buyer agent who runs out of credit may be forbidden to make further offers, or a seller agent is obliged to deliver after closing a deal. We assume that agents may choose not to fulfill all their obligations and hence may be sanctioned by the MAS. Notice that, when activities are distributed, normative positions must flow from the activities in which they are generated to those in which they take effect. For instance, the sellers obligation above must flow (or be propagated) from a negotiation activity to a delivery activity. Since in an open, regulated MAS one cannot embed normative aspects into the agents design, we adopt the view that the MAS should be supplemented with a separate set of norms that further regulates the behaviour of participating agents. In order to model the separation of concerns between the coordination level (agents interactions) and the normative level (propagation of normative positions), we propose an artifact called the Normative Structure (NS). Within a NS conflicts may arise due to the dynamic nature of the MAS and the concurrency of agents actions. For instance, an agent may be obliged and prohibited to do the 636 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS very same action in an activity. Since the regulation of a MAS entails that participating agents need to be aware of the validity of those actions that take place within it, such conflicts ought to be identified and possibly resolved if a claim of validity is needed for an agent to engage in an action or be sanctioned. However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable. We show this by formalising the notion of conflict, providing a mapping of NSs into Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) and borrowing well-known theoretical results from the field of CPNs. We believe that online conflict detection and resolution is required. Hence, we present a tractable algorithm for conflict resolution. This algorithm is paramount for the distributed enactment of a NS. The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we detail a scenario to serve as an example throughout the paper. Next, in Section 3 we formally define the normative structure artifact. Further on, in Section 4 we formalise the notion of conflict to subsequently analyse the complexity of conflict detection in terms of CPNs in Section 5. Section 6 describes the computational management of NSs by describing their enactment and presenting an algorithm for conflict resolution. Finally, we comment on related work, draw conclusions and report on future work in Section 7. 2. SCENARIO We use a supply-chain scenario in which companies and individuals come together at an online marketplace to conduct business. The overall transaction procedure may be organised as six distributed activities, represented as nodes in the diagram in Figure 1. They involve different participants whose behaviour is coordinated through protocols. In this scenario agents can play one of four roles: marExit Registration Payment Delivery Negotiation Coordination Model Contract Figure 1: Activity Structure of the Scenario ketplace accountant (acc), client, supplier (supp) and warehouse managers (wm). The arrows connecting the activities represent how agents can move from one activity to another. After registering at the marketplace, clients and suppliers get together in an activity where they negotiate the terms of their transaction, i.e. prices, amounts of goods to be delivered, deadlines and other details. In the contract activity, the order becomes established and an invoice is prepared. The client will then participate in a payment activity, verifying his credit-worthiness and instructing his bank to transfer the correct amount of money. The supplier in the meantime will arrange for the goods to be delivered (e.g. via a warehouse manager) in the delivery activity. Finally, agents can leave the marketplace conforming to a predetermined exit protocol. The marketplace accountant participates in most of the activities as a trusted provider of auditing tools. In the rest of the paper we shall build on this scenario to exemplify the notion of normative structure and to illustrate our approach to conflict detection and resolution in a distributed setting. 3. NORMATIVE STRUCTURE In MASs agents interact according to protocols which naturally are distributed. We advocate that actions in one such protocol may have an effect on the enactment of other protocols. Certain actions can become prohibited or obligatory, for example. We take normative positions to be obligations, prohibitions and permissions akin to work described in [26]. The intention of adding or removing a normative position we call normative command. Occurrences of normative positions in one protocol may also have consequences for other protocols1 . In order to define our norm language and specify how normative positions are propagated, we have been inspired by multi-context systems [14]. These systems allow the structuring of knowledge into distinct formal theories and the definition of relationships between them. The relationships are expressed as bridge rules - deducibility of formulae in some contexts leads to the deduction of other formulae in other contexts. Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23]. The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes. We are concerned with the propagation and distribution of normative positions within a network of distributed, normative scenes as a consequence of agents actions. We take normative scenes to be sets of normative positions and utterances that are associated with an underlying interaction protocol corresponding to an activity. In this section, we first present a simple language capturing these aspects and formally introduce the notions of normative scene, normative transition rule and normative structure. We give the intended semantics of these rules and show how to control a MAS via norms in an example. 3.1 Basic Concepts The building blocks of our language are terms and atomic formulae: Def. 1. A term, denoted as t, is (i) any constant expressed using lowercase (with or without subscripts), e.g. a, b0, c or (ii) any variable expressed using uppercase (with or without subscripts), e.g. X, Y, Zb or (iii) any function f(t1, . . . , tn), where f is an n-ary function symbol and t1, .., tn are terms. Some examples of terms and functions are Credit, price or offer(bible, 30) being respectively a variable, a constant and a function. We will be making use of identifiers throughout the paper, which are constant terms and also need the following definition: Def. 2. An atomic formula is any construct p(t1, . . . , tn), where p is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1, . . . , tn are terms. The set of all atomic formulae is denoted as Δ. We focus on an expressive class of MASs in which interaction is carried out by means of illocutionary speech acts exchanged among participating agents: Def. 3. Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 637 a set of illocutionary particles (e.g. inform, request, offer); ag, ag are agent identifiers; r, r are role identifiers; δ, an arbitrary ground term, is the content of the message, built from a shared content language; t ∈ N is a time stamp. The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10). Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables. In the description of a protocol, for instance, the precise values of the message exchanged can be left unspecified. During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution. We can thus define illocution schemata: Def. 4. An illocution schema ¯I is any atomic formula p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) in which some of the terms may either be variables or may contain variables. 3.2 Formal Definition of the Notion of NS We first define normative scenes as follows: Def. 5. A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request. Note that the state of a normative scene Δs evolves over time. These normative scenes are connected to one another via normative transitions that specify how utterances and normative positions in one scene affect other normative scenes. As mentioned above, activities are not independent since illocutions uttered in some of them may have an effect on other ones. Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated. These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity. Our transition rules are thus defined: Def. 6. A normative transition rule R is of the form: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) where ¯I is an illocution schema, N is a normative position (i.e. permission, prohibition or obligation), ids is an identifier for activity s and C is a normative command. We endow our language with the usual semantics of rulebased languages [19]. Rules map an existing normative structure to a new normative structure where only the state of the normative scenes change. In the definitions below we rely on the standard concept of substitution [9]. Def. 7. A normative transition is a tuple b = idb, rb where idb is an identifier and rb is a normative transition rule. We are proposing to extend the notion of MAS, regulated by protocols, with an extra layer consisting of normative scenes and normative transitions. This layer is represented as a bi-partite graph that we term normative structure. A normative structure relates normative scenes and normative transitions specifying which normative positions are to be generated or removed in which normative scenes. Def. 8. A normative structure is a labelled bi-partite graph NS = Nodes, Edges, Lin , Lout . Nodes is a set S∪B where S is a set of normative scenes and B is a set of normative transitions. Edges is a set Ain ∪ Aout where Ain ⊆ S × B is a set of input arcs labelled with an atomic formula using the labelling function Lin : Ain → D; and Aout ⊆ B × S is a set of output arcs labelled with a normative position using the labelling function Lout : Aout → N. The following must hold: 1. Each atomic formula appearing in the LHS of a rule rb must be of the form (ids : D) where s ∈ S and D ∈ Δ and ∃ain ∈ Ain such that ain = (s, b) and Lin (ain ) = D. 2. The atomic formula appearing in the RHS of a rule rb must be of the form add(ids : N) or remove(ids : N) where s ∈ S and ∃aout ∈ Aout such that aout = (b, s) and Lout (aout ) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain such that a = (s, b) and b = idb, rb and Lin (a) = D then (ids:D) must occur in the LHS of rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout such that a = (b, s) and b = idb, rb and Lout (a) = N then add(ids : N) or remove(ids : N) must occur in the RHS of rb. The first two points ensure that every atomic formulae on the LHS of a normative transition rule labels an arc entering the appropriate normative transition in the normative structure, and that the atomic formula on the RHS labels the corresponding outgoing arc. Points three and four ensure that labels from all incoming arcs are used in the LHS of the normative transition rule that these arcs enter into, and that the labels from all outgoing arcs are used in the RHS of the normative transition rule that these arcs leave. 3.3 Intended Semantics The formal semantics will be defined via a mapping to Coloured Petri Nets in Section 5.1. Here we start defining the intended semantics of normative transition rules by describing how a rule changes a normative scene of an existing normative structure yielding a new normative structure. Each rule is triggered once for each substitution that unifies the left-hand side V of the rule with the state of the corresponding normative scenes. An atomic formula (i.e. an utterance or a normative position) holds iff it is unifiable with an utterance or normative position that belongs to the state of the corresponding normative scene. Every time a rule is triggered, the normative command specified on the right-hand side of that rule is carried out, intending to add or remove a normative position from the state of the corresponding normative scene. However, addition is not unconditional as conflicts may arise. This topic will be treated in Sections 4 and 6.1. 638 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 3.4 Example In our running example we have the following exemplary normative transition rule: „ payment : obl(inform(X, client, Y, acc, pay(Z, P, Q), T )), payment : utt(inform(X, client, Y, acc, pay(Z, P, Q), T )) « delivery : add(obl(inform(Y, wm, X, client, delivered(Z, Q), T ))) That is, during the payment activity, an obligation on client X to inform accountant Y about the payment P of item Z at time T and the corresponding utterance which fulfills this obligation allows the flow of a norm to the delivery activity. The norm is an obligation on agent Y (this time taking up the role of the warehouse manager wm) to send a message to client X that item Z has been delivered. We show in Figure 2 a diagrammatic representation of how activities and a normative structure relate: Payment Delivery Contract Normative Level Exit Registration Payment Delivery Negotiation Coordination Level Contract nt Figure 2: Activities and Normative Structure As illocutions are uttered during activities, normative positions arise. Utterances and normative positions are combined in transition rules, causing the flow of normative positions between normative scenes. The connection between the two levels is described in Section 6.2. 4. CONFLICT DEFINITION The terms deontic conflict and deontic inconsistency have been used interchangeably in the literature. However, in this paper we adopt the view of [7] in which the authors suggest that a deontic inconsistency arises when an action is simultaneously permitted and prohibited - since a permission may not be acted upon, no real conflict occurs. The situations when an action is simultaneously obliged and prohibited are, however, deontic conflicts, as both obligations and prohibitions influence behaviours in a conflicting fashion. The content of normative positions in this paper are illocutions. Therefore, a normative conflict arises when an illocution is simultaneously obliged and prohibited. We propose to use the standard notion of unification [9] to detect when a prohibition and a permission overlap. For instance, an obligation obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) and a prohibition prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) are in conflict as they unify under σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T }). We formally capture this notion: Def. 9. A (deontic) conflict arises between two normative positions N and N under a substitution σ, denoted as conflict(N, N , σ), if and only if N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I ) and unify(¯I,¯I , σ). That is, a prohibition and an obligation are in conflict if, and only if, their illocutions unify under σ. The substitution σ, called here the conflict set, unifies the agents, roles and atomic formulae. We assume that unify is a suitable implementation of a unification algorithm which i) always terminates (possibly failing, if a unifier cannot be found); ii) is correct; and iii) has linear computational complexity. Inconsistencies caused by the same illocution being simultaneously permitted and prohibited can be formalised similarly. In this paper we focus on prohibition/obligation conflicts, but the computational machinery introduced in Section 6.1 can equally be used to detect prohibition/permission inconsistencies, if we substitute modality obl for per. 5. FORMALISING CONFLICT-FREEDOM In this section we introduce some background knowledge on CPNs assuming a basic understanding of ordinary Petri Nets. For technical details we refer the reader to [16]. We then map NSs to CPNs and analyse their properties. CPNs combine the strength of Petri nets with the strength of functional programming languages. On the one hand, Petri nets provide the primitives for the description of the synchronisation of concurrent processes. As noticed in [16], CPNs have a semantics which builds upon true concurrency, instead of interleaving. In our opinion, a true-concurrency semantics is easier to work with because it is the way we envisage the connection between the coordination level and the normative level of a multi-agent system to be. On the other hand, the functional programming languages used by CPNs provide the primitives for the definition of data types and the manipulation of their data values. Thus, we can readily translate expressions of a normative structure. Last but not least, CPNs have a well-defined semantics which unambiguously defines the behaviour of each CPN. Furthermore, CPNs have a large number of formal analysis methods and tools by which properties of CPNs can be proved. Summing up, CPNs provide us with all the necessary features to formally reason about normative structures given that an adequate mapping is provided. In accordance with Petri nets, the states of a CPN are represented by means of places. But unlike Petri Nets, each place has an associated data type determining the kind of data which the place may contain. A state of a CPN is called a marking. It consists of a number of tokens positioned on the individual places. Each token carries a data value which has the type of the corresponding place. In general, a place may contain two or more tokens with the same data value. Thus, a marking of a CPN is a function which maps each place into a multi-set2 of tokens of the correct type. One often refers to the token values as token colours and one also refers to the data types as colour sets. The types of a CPN can be arbitrarily complex. Actions in a CPN are represented by means of transitions. An incoming arc into a transition from a place indicates that the transition may remove tokens from the corresponding place while an outgoing arc indicates that the transition may add tokens. The exact number of tokens and their data values are determined by the arc expressions, which are encoded using the programming language chosen for the CPN. A transition is enabled in a CPN if and only if all the 2 A multi-set (or bag) is an extension to the notion of set, allowing the possibility of multiple appearances of the same element. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 639 variables in the expressions of its incoming arcs are bound to some value(s) (each one of these bindings is referred to as a binding element). If so, the transition may occur by removing tokens from its input places and adding tokens to its output places. In addition to the arc expressions, it is possible to attach a boolean guard expression (with variables) to each transition. Putting all the elements above together we obtain a formal definition of CPN that shall be employed further ahead for mapping purposes. Def. 10. A CPN is a tuple Σ, P, T, A, N, C, G, E, I where: (i) Σ is a finite set of non-empty types, also called colour sets; (ii) P is a finite set of places; (iii) T is a finite set of transitions; (iv) A is a finite set of arcs; (v) N is a node function defined from A into P × T ∪ T × P; (vi) C is a colour function from P into Σ; (vii) G is a guard function from T into expressions; (viii) E is an arc expression function from A into expressions; (ix) I is an initialisation function from P into closed expressions; Notice that the informal explanation of the enabling and occurrence rules given above provides the foundations to understand the behaviour of a CPN. In accordance with ordinary Petri nets, the concurrent behaviour of a CPN is based on the notion of step. Formally, a step is a non-empty and finite multi-set over the set of all binding elements. Let step S be enabled in a marking M. Then, S may occur, changing the marking M to M . Moreover, we say that marking M is directly reachable from marking M by the occurrence of step S, and we denote it by M[S > M . A finite occurrence sequence is a finite sequence of steps and markings: M1[S1 > M2 . . . Mn[Sn > Mn+1 such that n ∈ N and Mi[Si > Mi+1 ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. The set of all possible markings reachable for a net Net from a marking M is called its reachability set, and is denoted as R(Net, M). 5.1 Mapping to Coloured Petri Nets Our normative structure is a labelled bi-partite graph. The same is true for a Coloured Petri Net. We are presenting a mapping f from one to the other, in order to provide semantics for the normative structure and prove properties about it by using well-known theoretical results from work on CPNs. The mapping f makes use of correspondences between normative scenes and CPN places, normative transitions and CPN transitions and finally, between arc labels and CPN arc expressions. S → P B → T Lin ∪ Lout → E The set of types is the singleton set containing the colour NP (i.e. Σ = {NP}). This complex type is structured as follows (we use CPN-ML [4] syntax): color NPT = with Obl | Per | Prh | NoMod color IP = with inform | declare | offer color UTT = record illp : IP ag1, role1, ag2, role2 : string content: string time : int color NP = record mode : NPT illoc : UTT Modelling illocutions as norms without modality (NoMod) is a formal trick we use to ensure that sub-nets can be combined as explained below. Arcs are mapped almost directly. A is a finite set of arcs and N is a node function, such that ∀a ∈ A ∃a ∈ Ain ∪Aout . N(a) = a . The initialisation function I is defined as I(p) = Δs (∀s ∈ S where p is obtained from s using the mapping; remember that s = ids, Δs ). Finally, the colour function C assigns the colour NP to every place: C(p) = NP (∀p ∈ P). We are not making use of the guard function G. In future work, this function can be used to model constraints when we extend the expressiveness of our norm language. 5.2 Properties of Normative Structures Having defined the mapping from normative structures to Coloured Petri Nets, we now look at properties of CPNs that help us understand the complexity of conflict detection. One question we would like to answer is, whether at a given point in time, a given normative structure is conflict-free. Such a snapshot of a normative structure corresponds to a marking in the mapped CPN. Def. 11. Given a marking Mi, this marking is conflictfree if ¬∃p ∈ P. ∃np1, np2 ∈ Mi(p) such that np1.mode = Obl and np2.mode = Prh and np1.illoc and np2.illoc unify under a valid substitution. Another interesting question would be, whether a conflict will occur from such a snapshot of the system by propagating the normative positions. In order to answer this question, we first translate the snapshot of the normative structure to the corresponding CPN and then execute the finite occurence sequence of markings and steps, verifying the conflict-freedom of each marking as we go along. Def. 12. Given a marking Mi, a finite occurrence sequence Si, Si+1, ..., Sn is called conflict-free, if and only if Mi[Si > Mi+1 . . . Mn[Sn > Mn+1 and Mk is conflict-free for all k such that i ≤ k ≤ n + 1. However, the main question we would like to investigate, is whether or not a given normative structure is conflictresistant, that is, whether or not the agents enacting the MAS are able to bring about conflicts through their actions. As soon as one includes the possibility of actions (or utterances) from autonomous agents, one looses determinism. Having mapped the normative structure to a CPN, we now add CPN models of the agents interactions. Each form of agent interaction (i.e. each activity) can be modelled using CPNs along the lines of Cost et al. [5]. These nondeterministic CPNs feed tokens into the CPN that models the normative structure. This leads to the introduction of non-determinism into the combined CPN. The lower half of figure 3 shows part of a CPN model of an agent protocol where the arc denoted with 1 represents some utterance of an illocution by an agent. The target transition of this arc, not only moves a token on to the next state of this CPN, but also places a token in the place corresponding to the appropriate normative scene in the CPN model of the normative structure (via arc 2). Transition 3 finally could propagate that token in form of an obligation, for example. Thus, from a given marking, many different occurrence sequences are possible depending on the agents actions. We make use of the reachability set R to define a situation in which agents cannot cause conflicts. 640 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Figure 3: Constructing the combined CPN Def. 13. Given a net N, a marking M is conflict-resistant if and only if all markings in R(N,M) are conflict-free. Checking conflict-freedom of a marking can be done in polynomial time by checking all places of the CPN for conflicting tokens. Conflict-freedom of an occurrence sequence in the CPN that represents the normative structure can also be done in polynomial time since this sequence is deterministic given a snapshot. Whether or not a normative structure is designed safely corresponds to checking the conflict-resistance of the initial marking M0. Now, verifying conflict-resistance of a marking becomes a very difficult task. It corresponds to the reachability problem in a CPN: can a state be reached or a marking achieved, that contains a conflict?. This reachability problem is known to be NP-complete for ordinary Petri Nets [22] and since CPNs are functionally identical, we cannot hope to verify conflict-resistance of a normative structure off-line in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, distributed, run-time mechanisms are needed to ensure that a normative structure maintains consistency. We present one such mechanism in the following section. 6. MANAGING NORMATIVE STRUCTURES Once a conflict (as defined in Section 4) has been detected, we propose to employ the unifier to resolve the conflict. In our example, if the variables in prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) do not get the values specified in substitution σ then there will not be a conflict. However, rather than computing the complement set of a substitution (which can be an infinite set) we propose to annotate the prohibition with the unifier itself and use it to determine what the variables of that prohibition cannot be in future unifications in order to avoid a conflict. We therefore denote annotated prohibitions as prh(¯I) Σ, where Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, is a set of unifiers. Annotated norms3 are interpreted as deontic constructs with curtailed influences, that is, their effect (on agents, roles and illocutions) has been limited by the set Σ of unifiers. A prohibition may be in conflict with various obligations in a given normative scene s = id, Δ and we need to record (and possibly avoid) all these conflicts. We define below an algorithm which ensures that a normative position will be added to a normative scene in such a way that it will not cause any conflicts. 3 Although we propose to curtail prohibitions, the same machinery can be used to define the curtailment of obligations instead. These different policies are dependent on the intended deontic semantics and requirements of the systems addressed. For instance, some MASs may require that their agents should not act in the presence of conflicts, that is, the obligation should be curtailed. 6.1 Conflict Resolution We propose a fine-grained way of resolving normative conflicts via unification. We detect the overlapping of the influences of norms , i.e. how they affect the behaviour of the concerned agents, and we curtail the influence of the normative position, by appropriately using the annotations when checking if the norm applies to illocutions. The algorithm shown in Figure 4 depicts how we maintain a conflict-free set of norms. It adds a given norm N to an existing, conflictfree normative state Δ, obtaining a resulting new normative state Δ which is conflict-free, that is, its prohibitions are annotated with a set of conflict sets indicating which bindings for variables have to be avoided for conflicts not to take place. algorithm addNorm(N, Δ) begin 1 timestamp(N) 2 case N of 3 per(¯I): Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 4 prh(I): if N ∈ Δ s.t. conflict(N, N , σ) then Δ := Δ 5 else Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 6 prh(¯I): 7 begin 8 Σ := ∅ 9 for each N ∈ Δ do 10 if conflict(N, N , σ) then Σ := Σ ∪ {σ} 11 Δ := Δ ∪ {N Σ} 12 end 13 obl(¯I): 14 begin 15 Δ1 := ∅; Δ2 := ∅ 16 for each (N Σ) ∈ Δ do 17 if N = prh(I) then 18 if conflict(N , N, σ) then Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 19 else nil 20 else 21 if conflict(N , N, σ) then 22 begin 23 Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 24 Δ2 := Δ2 ∪ {N (Σ ∪ {σ})} 25 end 26 Δ := (Δ − Δ1) ∪ Δ2 ∪ {N} 27 end 28 end case 29 return Δ end Figure 4: Algorithm to Preserve Conflict-Freedom The algorithm uses a case of structure to differentiate the different possibilities for a given norm N. Line 3 addresses the case when the given norm is a permission: N is simply added to Δ. Lines 4-5 address the case when we attempt to add a ground prohibition to a normative state: if it conflicts with any obligation, then it is discarded; otherwise it is added to the normative state. Lines 6-12 describe the situation when the normative position to be added is a nonground prohibition. In this case, the algorithm initialises Σ to an empty set and loops (line 9-10) through the norms N in the old normative state Δ. Upon finding one that conflicts with N, the algorithm updates Σ by adding the newly found conflict set σ to it (line 10). By looping through Δ, we are able to check any conflicts between the new prohibition and the existing obligations, adequately building the annotation Σ to be used when adding N to Δ in line 11. Lines 13-27 describe how a new obligation is accommodated to an existing normative state. We make use of two initially empty, temporary sets, Δ1, Δ2. The algorithm loops through Δ (lines 16-25) picking up those annotated prohibitions N Σ which conflict with the new obligation. There are, however, two cases to deal with: the one when a ground The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 641 prohibition is found (line 17), and its exception, covering non-ground prohibitions (line 20). In both cases, the old prohibition is stored in Δ1 (lines 18 and 23) to be later removed from Δ (line 26). However, in the case of a nonground prohibition, the algorithm updates its annotation of conflict sets (line 24). The loop guarantees that an exhaustive (linear) search through a normative state takes place, checking if the new obligation is in conflict with any existing prohibitions, possibly updating the annotations of these conflicting prohibitions. In line 26 the algorithm builds the new updated Δ by removing the old prohibitions stored in Δ1 and adding the updated prohibitions stored in Δ2 (if any), as well as the new obligation N. Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations. The annotations can be empty, though: this is the case when we have a ground prohibition or a prohibition which does not unify/conflict with any obligation. Permissions do not affect our algorithm and they are appropriately dealt with (line 3). Any attempt to insert a ground prohibition which conflicts, yields the same normative state (line 4). When a new obligation is being added then the algorithm guarantees that all prohibitions are considered (lines 14-27), leading to the removal of conflicting ground prohibitions or the update of annotations of non-ground prohibitions. The algorithm always terminates: the loops are over a finite set Δ and the conflict checks and set operations always terminate. The complexity of the algorithm is linear: the set Δ is only examined once for each possible case of norm to be added. When managing normative states we may also need to remove normative positions. This is straightforward: permissions can be removed without any problems; annotated prohibitions can also be removed without further considerations; obligations, however, require some housekeeping. When an obligation is to be removed, we must check it against all annotated prohibitions in order to update their annotations. We apply the conflict check and obtain a unifier, then remove this unifier from the prohibitions annotation. We invoke the removal algorithm as removeNorm(N, Δ): it returns a new normative state Δ in which N has been removed, with possible alterations to other normative positions as explained. 6.2 Enactment of a Normative Structure The enactment of a normative structure amounts to the parallel, distributed execution of normative scenes and normative transitions. For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2. With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)). Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene. For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows. Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions. For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2). Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state. We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example. Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1. Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to. In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt. For normative transitions, the process works differently. Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule. In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions. Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes. For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene. The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing. This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once. In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene. Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper. After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7. RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold. Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner. To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction. In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS. However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms. Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent. This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one. The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure. The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns. The normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets. That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular. The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis. In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols. Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs. To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere. Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts. Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved. His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance. The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27]. The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced. These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work. We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS. As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]). We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment. Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies). On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection. The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.

Introducción Una característica fundamental de los sistemas abiertos y regulados de múltiples agentes en los que interactúan los agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes están destinados a cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden usarse para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas para las realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos: la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y ejecución de la masa. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]) funcionan de manera centralizada que crea cuellos de botella y puntos de falla individuales. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la promulgación distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo, abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas abiertos, regulados y multiagentes de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades relacionadas múltiples donde los agentes interactúan. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se queda sin crédito puede tener prohibido hacer más ofertas, o un agente de vendedores está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un acuerdo. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por el MAS. Observe que, cuando se distribuyen actividades, las posiciones normativas deben fluir de las actividades en las que se generan a aquellos en los que surtan efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación de los vendedores anteriores debe fluir (o ser propagada) de una actividad de negociación a una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto, regulado, uno no puede incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la opinión de que el MAS debe complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regula aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de las preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de los agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado estructura normativa (NS). Dentro de un conflicto NS pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica de la MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido a hacer el 636 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas de la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de aquellas acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, tales conflictos deben identificarse y posiblemente resolverse si se necesita un reclamo de validez para que un agente participe en una accióno ser sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el tiempo de diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto al formalizar la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSS en redes de Petri de color (CPN) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPN. Creemos que se requiere la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es primordial para la promulgación distribuida de un ns. El papel está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario para servir como ejemplo en todo el documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de la estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para analizar posteriormente la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPN en la Sección 5. La Sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de NSS describiendo su promulgación y presentando un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7. 2. Escenario Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que las empresas y las personas se unen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento de transacción general puede organizarse como seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama en la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento se coordina a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de los cuatro roles: Modelo de coordinación de negociación de pagos de registro de Marexit Modelo de coordinación de negociación Contrato Figura 1: Estructura de actividad del escenario Ketplace Contador (ACC), Cliente, Proveedor (Supp) y Gerentes de Warehouse (WM). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad en la que negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de bienes que se entregarán, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, la orden se establece y se prepara una factura. Luego, el cliente participará en una actividad de pago, verificando su valía de crédito e instruyendo a su banco que transfiera la cantidad correcta de dinero. Mientras tanto, el proveedor organizará que se entreguen los productos (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden dejar el mercado ajustado a un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor confiable de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento, construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido.3. La estructura normativa en los agentes de masa interactúa según los protocolos que naturalmente se distribuyen. Abogamos que las acciones en uno de esos protocolo pueden tener un efecto sobre la promulgación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden estar prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos que las posiciones normativas sean obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa que llamamos comando normativo. Las ocurrencias de posiciones normativas en un protocolo también pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos1. Para definir nuestro lenguaje de norma y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de contexto múltiple [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en distintas teorías formales y la definición de relaciones entre ellos. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas del puente: la deducibilidad de las fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas se han utilizado con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce en nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la expresión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupa la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos que las escenas normativas sean conjuntos de posiciones y expresiones normativas que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de la escena normativa, la regla de transición normativa y la estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de las normas en un ejemplo.3.1 Conceptos básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro idioma son términos y fórmulas atómicas: def.1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada usando minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), p.A, B0, C o (ii) cualquier variable expresada utilizando mayúsculas (con o sin subíndice), p. X, y, zb o (iii) Cualquier función f (t1, ..., tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ary y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son crédito, precio u oferta (Biblia, 30) respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Haremos uso de identificadores en todo el documento, que son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: def.2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p (t1, ..., tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado N-oral y T1 ,..., TN son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como δ. Nos centramos en una clase expresiva de masa en la que se lleva a cabo la interacción mediante actos de discurso ilocucionario intercambiados entre los agentes participantes: def.3. Illocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas terrestres que tienen la forma P (Ag, R, Ag, R, δ, T) donde P es un elemento de 1 aquí, resumimos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellas genéricamente como actividades. El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitud, oferta);AG, AG son identificadores de agentes;R, R son identificadores de roles;δ, un término terrestre arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido;t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de P (AG, R, AG, R, M, T) es que el agente AG juega el rol R envió el mensaje M al agente AG Rol de juego R en el tiempo t.Un ejemplo de ilocución es informar (AG4, Supp, AG3, Cliente, Oferta (Wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil referirse a ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no asociadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos del mensaje intercambiado pueden dejarse sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución terrestre. Por lo tanto, podemos definir esquemas de ilocución: def.4. Un esquema de ilocución ¯i es cualquier fórmula atómica P (Ag, R, Ag, R, δ, T) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables.3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS primero definimos escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: def.5. Una escena normativa es una tupla S = IDS, ΔS donde IDS es un identificador de escena y ΔS es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, expresiones y posiciones normativas) que se mantienen en s.También nos referiremos a ΔS como el estado de la escena normativa s.Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: ΔS = 8 <: Utt (solicitud (Sean, Cliente, Kev, Wm, Recibe (Wire, 200), 20)), Utt(Aceptar (Kev, Wm, Sean, Cliente, Recibir (cable, 200), 30)), Obl (informar (Kev, Wm, Sean, Cliente, entregado (cable, 200), 30)) 9 =;Es decir, el agente Sean asumió el rol del cliente ha solicitado el agente KEV (asumiendo el rol de Warehouse Manager WM) para recibir 200 kg de cable, y el agente KEV está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean desde que aceptó la solicitud. Tenga en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa ΔS evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las expresiones y las posiciones normativas en una escena afectan otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunos de ellos pueden tener un efecto en otros. Las reglas de transición normativa definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un comando normativo. Estas condiciones son expresiones o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado, por ejemplo, actividad: enunciado) que producen un comando normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición se definen así: def.6. Una regla de transición normativa R es de la forma: r :: = v c v :: = ids: d |V, V D :: = N |utt (¯i) n :: = per (¯i) |PRH (¯i) |obl (¯i) c :: = add (ids: n) |Eliminar (IDS: N) donde ¯i es un esquema de ilocución, n es una posición normativa (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), IDS es un identificador para la actividad S y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos nuestro idioma con la semántica habitual de los idiomas basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas asignan una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación, confiamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Def.7. Una transición normativa es una tupla B = IDB, RB donde IDB es un identificador y RB es una regla de transición normativa. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un gráfico bipartito que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas que especifican qué posiciones normativas se generarán o eliminarán en qué escenas normativas. Def.8. Una estructura normativa es un gráfico bipartito etiquetado ns = nodos, bordes, LIN, lout. Nodes es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes son un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin: Ain → D;y AOT ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado LOUT: AOUT → N. Lo siguiente debe mantener: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla Rb debe ser de la forma (IDS: D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ δ y ∃Ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (S, B) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla Rb debe ser de la forma agregue (ids: n) o eliminar (ids: n) donde s ∈ S y ∃Aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y lout ((aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y lin (a) = d entonces (ids: d) debe ocurrir en el LHS de Rb.4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y lout (a) = n luego agregue (ids: n) o eliminar (ids: n) debe ocurrir en el rhs de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmulas atómicas en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiquete un arco que ingresa a la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se usen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se usan en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa que dejan estos arcos.3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a las redes de Petri de color en la Sección 5.1. Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativa describiendo cómo una regla cambia una escena normativa de una estructura normativa existente que produce una nueva estructura normativa. Cada regla se desencadena una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes. Una fórmula atómica (es decir, un enunciado o una posición normativa) es un poco unificable con un enunciado o posición normativa que pertenece al estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Cada vez que se activa una regla, se lleva a cabo el comando normativo especificado en el lado derecho de esa regla, con la intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa del estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Sin embargo, la adición no es incondicional ya que pueden surgir conflictos. Este tema será tratado en las Secciones 4 y 6.1.638 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 3.4 Ejemplo En nuestro ejemplo de ejecución, tenemos la siguiente regla de transición normativa ejemplar: „Pago: OBL (Inform (X, Cliente, Y, ACC, Pay (Z, P, Q), T)), Pago: Utt (inform (x, cliente, y, acc, pay (z, p, q), t)) «Entrega: add (obl (inform (y, wm, x, cliente, entregado (Z, q), t))) es decir, durante la actividad de pago, una obligación en el Cliente X de informar el Contador y sobre el pago P del Artículo Z en el tiempo T y la expresión correspondiente que cumple esta obligación permite el flujo de una Normaa la actividad de entrega. La norma es una obligación para el Agente Y (esta vez asumiendo el papel del Gerente de Warehouse WM) para enviar un mensaje al Cliente X que se ha entregado el ítem Z. Mostramos en la Figura 2 una representación diagramática de cómo se relacionan las actividades y una estructura normativa: el contrato de entrega de pago Nivel normativo Registro de salida de la entrega de pagos Nivel de coordinación de negociación Contrato NT Figura 2: Actividades y estructura normativa A medida que se pronuncian ilocuciones durante las actividades, surgen posiciones normativas. Las expresiones y las posiciones normativas se combinan en las reglas de transición, causando el flujo de posiciones normativas entre escenas normativas. La conexión entre los dos niveles se describe en la Sección 6.2.4. Definición de conflicto Los términos conflictos deoípicos y inconsistencia deoípica se han utilizado indistintamente en la literatura. Sin embargo, en este documento adoptamos la opinión de [7] en la que los autores sugieren que surge una inconsistencia deóntica cuando una acción se permite y prohibida simultáneamente, ya que no se puede actuar un permiso, no se produce ningún conflicto real. Sin embargo, las situaciones en que una acción se obligan y prohibe simultáneamente son conflictos deónticos, ya que tanto las obligaciones como las prohibiciones influyen en los comportamientos de una manera conflictiva. El contenido de posiciones normativas en este documento son ilocuciones. Por lo tanto, surge un conflicto normativo cuando una ilocución está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida. Proponemos usar la noción estándar de unificación [9] para detectar cuando una prohibición y una superposición de permiso. Por ejemplo, una obligación obl (Inform (A1, R1, A2, R2, P (C, X), T)) y una Prohibición PRH (Inform (A1, R1, A2, R2, P (Y, D), T)) están en conflicto, ya que se unifican bajo σ = {a1/a1, r1/r1, a2/a2, r2/r2, y/c, x/d, t/t}). Capturamos formalmente esta noción: def.9. Un conflicto (deóntico) surge entre dos posiciones normativas n y n bajo una sustitución σ, denotada como conflicto (n, n, σ), si y solo si n = pRH (¯i), n = obl (¯i) y unificar(¯i, ¯i, σ). Es decir, una prohibición y una obligación están en conflicto si, y solo si sus ilocuciones se unen bajo σ. La sustitución σ, llamada aquí el conflicto establecido, unifica los agentes, roles y fórmulas atómicas. Suponemos que Unify es una implementación adecuada de un algoritmo de unificación que yo) siempre termina (posiblemente falla, si no se puede encontrar un unificador);ii) es correcto;y iii) tiene complejidad computacional lineal. Las inconsistencias causadas por la misma ilocución que se permite y prohibidas simultáneamente se pueden formalizar de manera similar. En este artículo nos centramos en los conflictos de prohibición/obligación, pero la maquinaria computacional introducida en la Sección 6.1 puede usarse igualmente para detectar inconsistencias de prohibición/permiso, si sustituimos la modalidad obl por PER.5. Formalizando la libertad de conflicto En esta sección, presentamos algunos conocimientos de antecedentes sobre CPN asumiendo una comprensión básica de las redes de Petri ordinarias. Para detalles técnicos, remitimos al lector a [16]. Luego asignamos NSS a CPN y analizamos sus propiedades. Los CPN combinan la fuerza de las redes de Petri con la fuerza de los lenguajes de programación funcional. Por un lado, las redes de Petri proporcionan las primitivas para la descripción de la sincronización de procesos concurrentes. Como se observó en [16], los CPN tienen una semántica que se basa en la verdadera concurrencia, en lugar de entrelazar. En nuestra opinión, es más fácil trabajar con una semántica de la concesión verdadera porque es la forma en que imaginamos la conexión entre el nivel de coordinación y el nivel normativo de un sistema de múltiples agentes. Por otro lado, los lenguajes de programación funcionales utilizados por los CPN proporcionan las primitivas para la definición de tipos de datos y la manipulación de sus valores de datos. Por lo tanto, podemos traducir fácilmente expresiones de una estructura normativa. Por último, pero no menos importante, los CPN tienen una semántica bien definida que define inequívocamente el comportamiento de cada CPN. Además, los CPN tienen una gran cantidad de métodos y herramientas de análisis formales por las cuales se pueden probar las propiedades de las CPN. En resumen, los CPN nos proporcionan todas las características necesarias para razonar formalmente sobre estructuras normativas dado que se proporciona un mapeo adecuado. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri, los estados de una CPN están representados por medio de lugares. Pero a diferencia de las redes de Petri, cada lugar tiene un tipo de datos asociado que determina el tipo de datos que el lugar puede contener. Un estado de CPN se llama marcado. Consiste en una serie de tokens posicionados en los lugares individuales. Cada token lleva un valor de datos que tiene el tipo de lugar correspondiente. En general, un lugar puede contener dos o más tokens con el mismo valor de datos. Por lo tanto, una marca de un CPN es una función que mapea cada lugar en un múltiple 2 de tokens del tipo correcto. A menudo se refiere a los valores de token como colores de token y otro también se refiere a los tipos de datos como conjuntos de color. Los tipos de una CPN pueden ser arbitrariamente complejos. Las acciones en una CPN se representan mediante transiciones. Un arco entrante en una transición de un lugar indica que la transición puede eliminar los tokens del lugar correspondiente, mientras que un arco saliente indica que la transición puede agregar tokens. El número exacto de tokens y sus valores de datos están determinados por las expresiones ARC, que están codificadas utilizando el lenguaje de programación elegido para la CPN. Una transición se habilita en un CPN si y solo si todos los 2 un set (o bolsa) multiset es una extensión de la noción de SET, lo que permite la posibilidad de múltiples apariencias del mismo elemento. El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07), 639 variables en las expresiones de sus arcos entrantes están unidos a algún valor (cada uno de estos enlaces se conoce como un elemento de unión). Si es así, la transición puede ocurrir eliminando los tokens de sus lugares de entrada y agregando tokens a sus lugares de salida. Además de las expresiones de arco, es posible unir una expresión de la guardia booleana (con variables) a cada transición. Al poner todos los elementos anteriores juntos, obtenemos una definición formal de CPN que se empleará más adelante para fines de mapeo. Def.10. Un CPN es una tupla σ, p, t, a, n, c, g, e, i donde: (i) σ es un conjunto finito de tipos no vacíos, también llamados conjuntos de color;(ii) P es un conjunto finito de lugares;(iii) t es un conjunto finito de transiciones;(iv) A es un conjunto finito de arcos;(v) n es una función de nodo definida desde A en p × t ∪ t × p;(vi) C es una función de color de P a σ;(vii) G es una función de guardia de t a expresiones;(viii) e es una función de expresión de arco de A en expresiones;(ix) I es una función de inicialización de P a expresiones cerradas;Observe que la explicación informal de las reglas de habilitación y ocurrencia dadas anteriormente proporciona los cimientos para comprender el comportamiento de una CPN. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri ordinarias, el comportamiento concurrente de una CPN se basa en la noción de paso. Formalmente, un paso es un set múltiple no vacío y finito sobre el conjunto de todos los elementos vinculantes. Deje que los pasos s se habiliten en un marcado M. Entonces, S puede ocurrir, cambiando el marcado m a m. Además, decimos que el marcado M es directamente accesible desde la marca M por la aparición de los pasos S, y la denotamos por m [s> m. Una secuencia de ocurrencia finita es una secuencia finita de pasos y marcas: M1 [S1> M2... Mn [sn> mn+1 tal que n ∈ N y mi [si> mi+1 ∀i ∈ {1 ,..., n}. El conjunto de todas las marcas posibles accesibles para una red neta de una marca M se llama su conjunto de accesibilidad, y se denota como R (NET, M).5.1 Mapeo a las redes de Petri coloreadas Nuestra estructura normativa es un gráfico bipartito etiquetado. Lo mismo es cierto para una red de Petri de color. Estamos presentando un mapeo F de uno a otro, para proporcionar semántica para la estructura normativa y probar propiedades al usar resultados teóricos bien conocidos del trabajo en CPN. El mapeo F utiliza correspondencias entre escenas normativas y lugares de CPN, transiciones normativas y transiciones de CPN y finalmente, entre etiquetas de arco y expresiones de arco de CPN. S → P B → T LIN ∪ LOUT → E El conjunto de tipos es el conjunto de singleton que contiene el color NP (es decir, Σ = {np}). Este tipo complejo está estructurado de la siguiente manera (usamos CPN-ML [4] sintaxis): color npt = con obl |Por |PRH |Nomod color ip = con informes |declarar |Oferta color utt = registro illp: ip ag1, rol1, ag2, rol2: contenido de cadena: tiempo de cadena: int color np = registro modo: npt illoc: UTT modelado ilocuciones como normas sin modalidad (nomod) es un truco formal que usamos para garantizarEsas sub-red se pueden combinar como se explica a continuación. Los arcos se asignan casi directamente. A es un conjunto finito de arcos y N es una función de nodo, de modo que ∀a ∈ A ∃a ∈ Ain ∪Aout. N (a) = a. La función de inicialización I se define como i (p) = ΔS (∀s ∈ S donde P se obtiene de S usando el mapeo; recuerde que S = IDS, ΔS). Finalmente, la función de color C asigna el color np a cada lugar: c (p) = np (∀p ∈ P). No estamos haciendo uso de la función de guardia G. En el trabajo futuro, esta función se puede utilizar para modelar restricciones cuando extendemos la expresividad de nuestro lenguaje de norma.5.2 Propiedades de las estructuras normativas que han definido el mapeo de las estructuras normativas a las redes de Petri de color, ahora observamos las propiedades de los CPN que nos ayudan a comprender la complejidad de la detección de conflictos. Una pregunta que nos gustaría responder es que, si en un momento dado, una estructura normativa dada está libre de conflictos. Tal instantánea de una estructura normativa corresponde a una marca en la CPN mapeada. Def.11. Dado un MI de marcado, esta marca es libre de conflictos si ¬∃p ∈ P. ∃np1, np2 ∈ Mi (p) tal que np1.mode = obl y np2.mode = prh y np1.illoc y np2.illoc unify bajo un válidosustitución. Otra pregunta interesante sería si se producirá un conflicto a partir de tal instantánea del sistema al propagar las posiciones normativas. Para responder a esta pregunta, primero traducimos la instantánea de la estructura normativa a la CPN correspondiente y luego ejecutamos la secuencia de marcas y pasos finitos, verificando la libertad de conflicto de cada marca a medida que avanzamos. Def.12. Dado un IM de marcado, una secuencia de ocurrencia finita Si, Si+1, ..., Sn se llama libre de conflictos, si y solo si mi [Si> Mi+1... Mn [Sn> Mn + 1 y MK no tiene conflictos para todos K de tal manera que yo ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Sin embargo, la pregunta principal que nos gustaría investigar es si una estructura normativa determinada es conflictiva o no, es decir, si los agentes que promulgan o no pueden lograr conflictos a través de sus acciones. Tan pronto como uno incluye la posibilidad de acciones (o enunciados) de agentes autónomos, uno pierde el determinismo. Habiendo mapeado la estructura normativa a un CPN, ahora agregamos modelos CPN de las interacciones de los agentes. Cada forma de interacción del agente (es decir, cada actividad) puede modelarse utilizando CPN a lo largo de las líneas de costo et al.[5]. Estos CPN no deterministas alimentan tokens en la CPN que modela la estructura normativa. Esto lleva a la introducción del no determinismo en la CPN combinada. La mitad inferior de la Figura 3 muestra parte de un modelo CPN de un protocolo de agente donde el arco denotado con 1 representa cierta expresión de una ilocución por parte de un agente. La transición objetivo de este arco, no solo mueve un token al siguiente estado de este CPN, sino que también coloca un token en el lugar correspondiente a la escena normativa apropiada en el modelo CPN de la estructura normativa (a través de ARC 2). La transición 3 finalmente podría propagar esa ficha en forma de obligación, por ejemplo. Por lo tanto, a partir de un marcado dado, son posibles muchas secuencias de ocurrencia diferentes dependiendo de las acciones de los agentes. Hacemos uso del conjunto de accesibilidad R para definir una situación en la que los agentes no pueden causar conflictos.640 El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Figura 3: Construcción de la def. CPN combinado.13. Dada una red n, una marca M es resistente al conflicto si y solo si todas las marcas en R (N, M) no tienen conflictos. Verificar la libertad de conflicto de una marca se puede hacer en el tiempo polinomial verificando todos los lugares de la CPN para fichas en conflicto. La falta de conflicto de una secuencia de ocurrencia en la CPN que representa la estructura normativa también se puede hacer en el tiempo polinomial ya que esta secuencia es determinista dada una instantánea. Si una estructura normativa está diseñada o no corresponde de forma segura para verificar la resistencia al conflicto de la marca inicial M0. Ahora, verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una marca se convierte en una tarea muy difícil. Corresponde al problema de accesibilidad en una CPN: ¿se puede alcanzar un estado o una marca lograda, que contiene un conflicto? Se sabe que este problema de accesibilidad es NP-NP para las redes de Petri ordinarias [22] y dado que las CPN son funcionalmente idénticas, no podemos esperar verificar la resistencia de conflictos de una estructura normativa fuera de línea en un tiempo razonable. Por lo tanto, se necesitan mecanismos distribuidos de tiempo de ejecución para garantizar que una estructura normativa mantenga la consistencia. Presentamos uno de esos mecanismo en la siguiente sección.6. Gestión de estructuras normativas Una vez que se ha detectado un conflicto (como se define en la Sección 4), proponemos emplear el unifier para resolver el conflicto. En nuestro ejemplo, si las variables en PRH (informar (A1, R1, A2, R2, P (Y, D), T)) no obtienen los valores especificados en la sustitución σ, entonces no habrá un conflicto. Sin embargo, en lugar de calcular el conjunto de complementos de una sustitución (que puede ser un conjunto infinito), proponemos anotar la prohibición con el unifier en sí y usarlo para determinar qué las variables de esa prohibición no pueden ser en futuras unificaciones para evitar unconflicto. Por lo tanto, denotamos prohibiciones anotadas como PRH (¯i) σ, donde σ = {σ1 ,..., σn}, es un conjunto de unificadores. Las normas anotadas3 se interpretan como construcciones deoticas con influencias reducidas, es decir, su efecto (en agentes, roles e ilocuciones) ha estado limitado por el conjunto σ de los unificadores. Una prohibición puede estar en conflicto con varias obligaciones en una escena normativa dada s = id, δ y necesitamos registrar (y posiblemente evitar) todos estos conflictos. Definimos debajo de un algoritmo que garantiza que se agregará una posición normativa a una escena normativa de tal manera que no cause ningún conflicto.3 Aunque proponemos reducir las prohibiciones, se puede usar la misma maquinaria para definir la reducción de las obligaciones. Estas diferentes políticas dependen de la semántica y requisitos deónticos previstos de los sistemas abordados. Por ejemplo, alguna masa puede requerir que sus agentes no actúen en presencia de conflictos, es decir, la obligación debe reducirse.6.1 Resolución de conflictos Proponemos una forma de grano fino de resolver conflictos normativos a través de la unificación. Detectamos la superposición de las influencias de las normas, es decir, cómo afectan el comportamiento de los agentes preocupados, y reducimos la influencia de la posición normativa, utilizando adecuadamente las anotaciones al verificar si la norma se aplica a las ilocuciones. El algoritmo que se muestra en la Figura 4 muestra cómo mantenemos un conjunto de normas sin conflictos. Agrega una norma dada n a un estado normativo existente y sin conflicto δ, obteniendo un nuevo estado normativo resultante δ que está libre de conflictos, es decir, sus prohibiciones se anotan con un conjunto de conjuntos de conflictos que indican qué enlaces para variables deben evitarsepara que no se realicen conflictos.algoritmo addnorm (n, δ) Comience 1 marca de tiempo (n) 2 caso n de 3 por (¯i): δ: = δ ∪ {n} 4 prh (i): si n ∈ δ s.t.conflicto (n, n, σ) luego δ: = Δ 5 más δ: = δ ∪ {n} 6 prh (¯i): 7 comienza 8 σ: = ∅ 9 para cada n ∈ δ do 10 if conflicto (n,,, n,,N, σ) Entonces σ: = σ ∪ {σ} 11 δ: = δ ∪ {n σ} 12 End 13 obl (¯i): 14 Comienza 15 Δ1: = ∅;Δ2: = ∅ 16 para cada (n σ) ∈ δ do 17 si n = pRH (i) entonces 18 si conflicto (n, n, σ) entonces Δ1: = Δ1 ∪ {n σ} 19 más nil 20 más 21 siconflicto (n, n, σ) luego 22 comienza 23 Δ1: = Δ1 ∪ {n σ} 24 Δ2: = Δ2 ∪ {n (σ ∪ {σ})} 25 End 26 δ: = (Δ - Δ1) ∪ Δ2∪ {n} 27 final 28 final caso 29 retorno Δ final Figura 4: Algoritmo para preservar el libertad de conflicto El algoritmo utiliza un caso de estructura para diferenciar las diferentes posibilidades para una norma dada N. La línea 3 aborda el caso cuando la norma dada esUn permiso: N simplemente se agrega a δ. Las líneas 4-5 abordan el caso cuando intentamos agregar una prohibición de tierra a un estado normativo: si entra en conflicto con alguna obligación, entonces se descarta;De lo contrario, se agrega al estado normativo. Las líneas 6-12 describen la situación en la que la posición normativa a agregar es una prohibición no inmóvil. En este caso, el algoritmo inicializa σ a un conjunto y bucles vacíos (línea 9-10) a través de las normas N en el estado normativo antiguo δ. Al encontrar uno que entra en conflicto con N, el algoritmo actualiza σ al agregar el conflicto recién encontrado establecido σ (línea 10). Al pasar a través de δ, podemos verificar cualquier conflicto entre la nueva prohibición y las obligaciones existentes, construyendo adecuadamente la anotación σ que se utilizará al agregar n a δ en la línea 11. Las líneas 13-27 describen cómo se acomoda una nueva obligación para un estado normativo existente. Usamos dos conjuntos temporales inicialmente vacíos, Δ1, Δ2. El algoritmo buce a través de δ (líneas 16-25) recogiendo las prohibiciones anotadas n σ que entran en conflicto con la nueva obligación. Sin embargo, hay dos casos con los que lidiar: el que se encuentra en el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 641 se encuentra la prohibición (línea 17), y su excepción, que cubre las prohibiciones no terrestres (línea 20). En ambos casos, la prohibición anterior se almacena en Δ1 (líneas 18 y 23) que luego se eliminarán de δ (línea 26). Sin embargo, en el caso de una prohibición sin reducción, el algoritmo actualiza su anotación de conjuntos de conflictos (línea 24). El bucle garantiza que se realiza una búsqueda exhaustiva (lineal) a través de un estado normativo, verificando si la nueva obligación está en conflicto con cualquier prohibición existente, posiblemente actualizando las anotaciones de estas prohibiciones contradictorias. En la línea 26, el algoritmo construye el nuevo δ actualizado al eliminar las antiguas prohibiciones almacenadas en Δ1 y agregar las prohibiciones actualizadas almacenadas en Δ2 (si las hay), así como la nueva obligación N. Nuestro algoritmo propuesto es correcto en eso, para un dado.Posición normativa N y un estado normativo δ, proporciona un nuevo estado normativo δ en el que todas las prohibiciones tienen anotaciones registrando cómo unifican con las obligaciones existentes. Sin embargo, las anotaciones pueden estar vacías: este es el caso cuando tenemos una prohibición terrestre o una prohibición que no unifica/entra en conflicto con ninguna obligación. Los permisos no afectan nuestro algoritmo y se tratan adecuadamente (línea 3). Cualquier intento de insertar una prohibición terrestre que entra en conflicto, produce el mismo estado normativo (línea 4). Cuando se agrega una nueva obligación, el algoritmo garantiza que se consideren todas las prohibiciones (líneas 14-27), lo que lleva a la eliminación de prohibiciones de tierra conflictivas o la actualización de anotaciones de prohibiciones no terrestres. El algoritmo siempre termina: los bucles superan un conjunto finito δ y las verificaciones de conflicto y las operaciones establecidas siempre terminan. La complejidad del algoritmo es lineal: el conjunto δ solo se examina una vez para cada posible caso de norma a agregar. Al administrar los estados normativos, también es posible que necesitemos eliminar posiciones normativas. Esto es sencillo: los permisos se pueden eliminar sin ningún problema;Las prohibiciones anotadas también se pueden eliminar sin más consideraciones;Las obligaciones, sin embargo, requieren cierta limpieza. Cuando se debe eliminar una obligación, debemos verificarla con todas las prohibiciones anotadas para actualizar sus anotaciones. Aplicamos la verificación de conflictos y obtenemos un unificador, luego eliminamos este unifier de la anotación de Prohibiciones. Invocamos el algoritmo de eliminación como removenorm (n, δ): devuelve un nuevo estado normativo δ en el que se ha eliminado N, con posibles alteraciones a otras posiciones normativas como se explica.6.2 Administración de una estructura normativa La promulgación de una estructura normativa equivale a la ejecución paralela y distribuida de escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Para fines ilustrativos, en adelante describiremos la interacción entre las escenas normativas de pago y entrega y la transición normativa que las une en la mitad superior de la Figura 2. Con este objetivo, considere, por ejemplo, OBL (informar (Jules, Cliente, Rod, ACC, Pay (Cobre, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment y que la entrega de servicio contiene PRH (Inform (barra, Wm, Jules, Cliente, entregado(Z, q), t)). Dichos estados indican que el cliente Jules está obligado a pagar £ 400 por 350 kg de cobre a la barra contable de acuerdo con la escena normativa de pago, mientras que Rod, asumiendo el papel de Gerente de almacén esta vez, tiene prohibido entregar algo al cliente Jules de acuerdo con elEntrega escena normativa. Para cada escena normativa, el proceso de promulgación es el siguiente. En primer lugar, procesa su cola de mensajes entrantes que contiene tres tipos de mensajes: expresiones de la actividad a la que está vinculada;y comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar posiciones normativas. Por ejemplo, en nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago recauda la ilocución i = utt ((informar (Jules, Cliente, Rod, ACC, Pay (Copper, 400, 350), 35)) que se mantiene al cliente Jules en espera de pago por cobre (Vía flecha A en la Figura 2). Las expresiones son de marca de tiempo y posteriormente se agregan al estado normativo. Tendríamos Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {i}, en nuestro ejemplo. Al recibir comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar una posición normativa, la escena normativa invoca el algoritmo de adición o eliminación correspondiente descrito en la Sección 6.1. En segundo lugar, la escena normativa reconoce su cambio de estado al enviar un mensaje de activación a cada transición normativa saliente a la que está conectado. En nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago estaría señalando su cambio de estado a la transición normativa NT. Para las transiciones normativas, el proceso funciona de manera diferente. Debido a que cada transición normativa controla el funcionamiento de una sola regla, al recibir un mensaje de activación, encuesta cada escena normativa entrante para sustituciones por los esquemas de ilocución relevantes en el LHS de su regla. En nuestro ejemplo, NT (que es responsable de la regla descrita en la Sección 3.4), encuestaría la escena normativa de pago (a través de Arrow B) por sustituciones. Al recibir respuestas de ellos (en forma de conjuntos de sustituciones junto con sellos de tiempo), tiene que unificar las sustituciones de cada una de estas escenas normativas. Para cada unificación que encuentra, la regla se dispara y, por lo tanto, el comando normativo correspondiente se envía a la escena normativa de salida. La transición normativa realiza un seguimiento del mensaje de disparo en el que envió y de los puestos de tiempo de las posiciones normativas que desencadenaron el disparo. Esto se hace para garantizar que las mismas posiciones normativas en el LHS de una regla solo activen su disparo una vez. En nuestro ejemplo, NT recibiría σ = {x/jules, y/rode, z/cobre, q/350} de la escena normativa de pago. Dado que las subestaciones en σ unifican con la regla NTS, la regla se dispara y el comando normativo agregue (entrega: obl (barra, wm, jules, cliente, entregado (cobre, 350), t)) se envía a la entrega normativaescena para obligar a Rod a entregar al cliente Jules 350 kg de cobre. Después de eso, la escena normativa de entrega invocaría el algoritmo AddNorm de la Figura 4 con ΔDelivery y N = OBL (Rod, Wm, Jules, Cliente, entregado (cobre, 350)) como argumentos.7. Trabajo y conclusiones relacionados Nuestras contribuciones en este documento son triple. En primer lugar, presentamos un enfoque para la gestión y el razonamiento sobre las normas de manera distribuida. Hasta donde sabemos, hay poco trabajo publicado en esta dirección. En [8, 21], se presentan dos idiomas para la aplicación distribuida de las normas en MAS. Sin embargo, en ambos trabajos, cada agente tiene una interfaz de mensajes local que reenvía mensajes legales de acuerdo con un conjunto de normas. Dado que estas interfaces son locales para cada agente, las normas solo se pueden expresar en términos de acciones de ese agente. Esta es una desventaja grave, p.Cuando uno necesita activar una obligación con un agente debido a un cierto mensaje de otro. La segunda contribución es la propuesta de una estructura normativa. La noción es fructífera porque permite la separación de preocupaciones normativas y de procedimiento. La estructura normativa que proponemos hace evidente la similitud entre la propagación de posiciones normativas y la propagación 642 la sexta intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) de tokens en redes de Petri de color. Esa similitud sugiere fácilmente un mapeo entre los dos, y da motivos a un tratamiento analítico conveniente de la estructura normativa, en general, y la complejidad de la detección de conflictos, en particular. La idea de modelar las interacciones (en forma de conversaciones) a través de Petri Nets se ha investigado en [18], donde el medio de interacción y los agentes individuales se modelan como sub-redes de CPN que posteriormente se combinan para el análisis. En [5], las conversaciones se diseñan y analizan primero a nivel de CPN y luego se traducen en protocolos. Lin et al.[20] Mapa de esquemas de conversación a CPNS. Hasta donde sabemos, el uso de esta representación en el apoyo de la detección de conflictos en MAS regulado no se ha informado en otra parte. Finalmente, presentamos un mecanismo distribuido para resolver conflictos normativos. Sartor [25] trata los conflictos normativos desde el punto de vista de la teoría legal y sugiere una forma de ordenar las normas involucradas. Su idea se implementa en [12] pero requiere un recurso central para el mantenimiento de las normas. El enfoque de la detección y resolución de conflictos es una adaptación y extensión del trabajo en gráficos de instanciación reportados en [17] y un algoritmo relacionado en [27]. El algoritmo presentado en el documento actual se puede utilizar para administrar estados normativos distribuidos: las escenas normativas que ocurren en paralelo tienen un estado normativo asociado δ al que el algoritmo se aplica de forma independiente cada vez que se introducirá una nueva norma. Estas tres contribuciones que presentamos en este documento abren muchas posibilidades para el trabajo futuro. Debemos mencionar primero, que, como estrategia amplia, estamos trabajando en una generalización de la noción de estructura normativa para que funcione con diferentes modelos de coordinación, con contenido deóntico más rico y además de diferentes realizaciones computacionales de MAS reguladas. Como primer paso en esta dirección, estamos aprovechando el desacoplamiento entre los protocolos de interacción y la orientación normativa declarativa que la estructura normativa pone a disposición, para proporcionar una capa normativa para las instituciones electrónicas (como se define en [1]). Esperamos que dicho acoplamiento doten a las instituciones electrónicas con un entorno normativo más flexible y más expresivo. Además, queremos extender nuestro modelo a lo largo de varias direcciones: (1) para manejar la negación y las limitaciones como parte del lenguaje de la norma, y en particular la noción de tiempo;(2) Para acomodar múltiples autoridades de normas jerárquicas basadas en roles, en la línea de Cholvy y Cuppens [3] y las relaciones de poder como lo sugieren Carabelea et al.[2];(3) Capturar en el algoritmo de resolución de conflictos diferentes semánticas relacionadas con las nociones deoípicas al apoyar diferentes axiomaciones (por ejemplo, fuerza relativa de prohibición versus obligación, nociones deónticas predeterminadas, inconsistencias deónticas). En el lado teórico, tenemos la intención de utilizar técnicas de análisis de CPN para caracterizar las clases de CPN (por ejemplo, acíclico, simétrico, etc.) correspondientes a familias de estructuras normativas que son susceptibles a la detección de conflictos de la línea acertable. La combinación de estas técnicas junto con nuestros mecanismos de resolución de conflictos en línea está destinada a dotar a los diseñadores de MAS con la capacidad de incorporar las normas en sus sistemas de manera principalmente.8.

        "The distributed management of norms is a challenging issue and we observe a lack of truly distributed computational realisations of normative models.",
        "In order to regulate the behaviour of autonomous agents that take part in multiple, related activities, we propose a normative model, the Normative Structure (NS), an artifact that is based on the propagation of normative positions (obligations, prohibitions, permissions), as consequences of agents actions.",

        "However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable.",

        "INTRODUCTION A fundamental feature of open, regulated multi-agent systems in which autonomous agents interact, is that participating agents are meant to comply with the conventions of the system.",
        "Norms can be used to model such conventions and hence as a means to regulate the observable behaviour of agents [6, 29].",
        "There are many contributions on the subject of norms from sociologists, philosophers and logicians (e.g., [15, 28]).",
        "However, there are very few proposals for computational realisations of normative models - the way norms can be integrated in the design and execution of MASs.",
        "The few that exist (e.g. [10, 13, 24]), operate in a centralised manner which creates bottlenecks and single points-of-failure.",
        "To our knowledge, no proposal truly supports the distributed enactment of normative environments.",
        "In our paper we approach that problem and propose means to handle conflicting commitments in open, regulated, multiagent systems in a distributed manner.",
        "The type of regulated MAS we envisage consists of multiple, concurrent, related activities where agents interact.",
        "Each agent may concurrently participate in several activities, and change from one activity to another.",
        "An agents actions within an activity may have consequences in the form of normative positions (i.e. obligations, permissions, and prohibitions) [26] that may constrain its future behaviour.",
        "For instance, a buyer agent who runs out of credit may be forbidden to make further offers, or a seller agent is obliged to deliver after closing a deal.",
        "We assume that agents may choose not to fulfill all their obligations and hence may be sanctioned by the MAS.",
        "Notice that, when activities are distributed, normative positions must flow from the activities in which they are generated to those in which they take effect.",
        "For instance, the sellers obligation above must flow (or be propagated) from a negotiation activity to a delivery activity.",
        "Since in an open, regulated MAS one cannot embed normative aspects into the agents design, we adopt the view that the MAS should be supplemented with a separate set of norms that further regulates the behaviour of participating agents.",
        "In order to model the separation of concerns between the coordination level (agents interactions) and the normative level (propagation of normative positions), we propose an artifact called the Normative Structure (NS).",
        "Within a NS conflicts may arise due to the dynamic nature of the MAS and the concurrency of agents actions.",
        "For instance, an agent may be obliged and prohibited to do the 636 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS very same action in an activity.",
        "Since the regulation of a MAS entails that participating agents need to be aware of the validity of those actions that take place within it, such conflicts ought to be identified and possibly resolved if a claim of validity is needed for an agent to engage in an action or be sanctioned.",
        "However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable.",
        "We show this by formalising the notion of conflict, providing a mapping of NSs into Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) and borrowing well-known theoretical results from the field of CPNs.",
        "We believe that online conflict detection and resolution is required.",
        "Hence, we present a tractable algorithm for conflict resolution.",
        "This algorithm is paramount for the distributed enactment of a NS.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we detail a scenario to serve as an example throughout the paper.",
        "Next, in Section 3 we formally define the normative structure artifact.",
        "Further on, in Section 4 we formalise the notion of conflict to subsequently analyse the complexity of conflict detection in terms of CPNs in Section 5.",
        "Section 6 describes the computational management of NSs by describing their enactment and presenting an algorithm for conflict resolution.",
        "Finally, we comment on related work, draw conclusions and report on future work in Section 7. 2.",
        "SCENARIO We use a supply-chain scenario in which companies and individuals come together at an online marketplace to conduct business.",
        "The overall transaction procedure may be organised as six distributed activities, represented as nodes in the diagram in Figure 1.",
        "They involve different participants whose behaviour is coordinated through protocols.",
        "In this scenario agents can play one of four roles: marExit Registration Payment Delivery Negotiation Coordination Model Contract Figure 1: Activity Structure of the Scenario ketplace accountant (acc), client, supplier (supp) and warehouse managers (wm).",
        "The arrows connecting the activities represent how agents can move from one activity to another.",
        "After registering at the marketplace, clients and suppliers get together in an activity where they negotiate the terms of their transaction, i.e. prices, amounts of goods to be delivered, deadlines and other details.",
        "In the contract activity, the order becomes established and an invoice is prepared.",
        "The client will then participate in a payment activity, verifying his credit-worthiness and instructing his bank to transfer the correct amount of money.",
        "The supplier in the meantime will arrange for the goods to be delivered (e.g. via a warehouse manager) in the delivery activity.",
        "Finally, agents can leave the marketplace conforming to a predetermined exit protocol.",
        "The marketplace accountant participates in most of the activities as a trusted provider of auditing tools.",
        "In the rest of the paper we shall build on this scenario to exemplify the notion of normative structure and to illustrate our approach to conflict detection and resolution in a distributed setting. 3.",
        "NORMATIVE STRUCTURE In MASs agents interact according to protocols which naturally are distributed.",
        "We advocate that actions in one such protocol may have an effect on the enactment of other protocols.",
        "Certain actions can become prohibited or obligatory, for example.",
        "We take normative positions to be obligations, prohibitions and permissions akin to work described in [26].",
        "The intention of adding or removing a normative position we call normative command.",
        "Occurrences of normative positions in one protocol may also have consequences for other protocols1 .",
        "In order to define our norm language and specify how normative positions are propagated, we have been inspired by multi-context systems [14].",
        "These systems allow the structuring of knowledge into distinct formal theories and the definition of relationships between them.",
        "The relationships are expressed as bridge rules - deducibility of formulae in some contexts leads to the deduction of other formulae in other contexts.",
        "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
        "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",
        "We are concerned with the propagation and distribution of normative positions within a network of distributed, normative scenes as a consequence of agents actions.",
        "We take normative scenes to be sets of normative positions and utterances that are associated with an underlying interaction protocol corresponding to an activity.",
        "In this section, we first present a simple language capturing these aspects and formally introduce the notions of normative scene, normative transition rule and normative structure.",
        "We give the intended semantics of these rules and show how to control a MAS via norms in an example. 3.1 Basic Concepts The building blocks of our language are terms and atomic formulae: Def. 1.",
        "A term, denoted as t, is (i) any constant expressed using lowercase (with or without subscripts), e.g. a, b0, c or (ii) any variable expressed using uppercase (with or without subscripts), e.g.",
        "X, Y, Zb or (iii) any function f(t1, . . . , tn), where f is an n-ary function symbol and t1, .., tn are terms.",
        "Some examples of terms and functions are Credit, price or offer(bible, 30) being respectively a variable, a constant and a function.",
        "We will be making use of identifiers throughout the paper, which are constant terms and also need the following definition: Def. 2.",
        "An atomic formula is any construct p(t1, . . . , tn), where p is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1, . . . , tn are terms.",
        "The set of all atomic formulae is denoted as Δ.",
        "We focus on an expressive class of MASs in which interaction is carried out by means of illocutionary speech acts exchanged among participating agents: Def. 3.",
        "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",
        "The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 637 a set of illocutionary particles (e.g. inform, request, offer); ag, ag are agent identifiers; r, r are role identifiers; δ, an arbitrary ground term, is the content of the message, built from a shared content language; t ∈ N is a time stamp.",
        "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
        "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",
        "In the description of a protocol, for instance, the precise values of the message exchanged can be left unspecified.",
        "During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution.",
        "We can thus define illocution schemata: Def. 4.",
        "An illocution schema ¯I is any atomic formula p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) in which some of the terms may either be variables or may contain variables. 3.2 Formal Definition of the Notion of NS We first define normative scenes as follows: Def. 5.",
        "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request.",
        "Note that the state of a normative scene Δs evolves over time.",
        "These normative scenes are connected to one another via normative transitions that specify how utterances and normative positions in one scene affect other normative scenes.",
        "As mentioned above, activities are not independent since illocutions uttered in some of them may have an effect on other ones.",
        "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
        "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",
        "Our transition rules are thus defined: Def. 6.",
        "A normative transition rule R is of the form: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) where ¯I is an illocution schema, N is a normative position (i.e. permission, prohibition or obligation), ids is an identifier for activity s and C is a normative command.",
        "We endow our language with the usual semantics of rulebased languages [19].",
        "Rules map an existing normative structure to a new normative structure where only the state of the normative scenes change.",
        "In the definitions below we rely on the standard concept of substitution [9].",
        "Def. 7.",
        "A normative transition is a tuple b = idb, rb where idb is an identifier and rb is a normative transition rule.",
        "We are proposing to extend the notion of MAS, regulated by protocols, with an extra layer consisting of normative scenes and normative transitions.",
        "This layer is represented as a bi-partite graph that we term normative structure.",
        "A normative structure relates normative scenes and normative transitions specifying which normative positions are to be generated or removed in which normative scenes.",
        "Def. 8.",
        "A normative structure is a labelled bi-partite graph NS = Nodes, Edges, Lin , Lout .",
        "Nodes is a set S∪B where S is a set of normative scenes and B is a set of normative transitions.",
        "Edges is a set Ain ∪ Aout where Ain ⊆ S × B is a set of input arcs labelled with an atomic formula using the labelling function Lin : Ain → D; and Aout ⊆ B × S is a set of output arcs labelled with a normative position using the labelling function Lout : Aout → N. The following must hold: 1.",
        "Each atomic formula appearing in the LHS of a rule rb must be of the form (ids : D) where s ∈ S and D ∈ Δ and ∃ain ∈ Ain such that ain = (s, b) and Lin (ain ) = D. 2.",
        "The atomic formula appearing in the RHS of a rule rb must be of the form add(ids : N) or remove(ids : N) where s ∈ S and ∃aout ∈ Aout such that aout = (b, s) and Lout (aout ) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain such that a = (s, b) and b = idb, rb and Lin (a) = D then (ids:D) must occur in the LHS of rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout such that a = (b, s) and b = idb, rb and Lout (a) = N then add(ids : N) or remove(ids : N) must occur in the RHS of rb.",
        "The first two points ensure that every atomic formulae on the LHS of a normative transition rule labels an arc entering the appropriate normative transition in the normative structure, and that the atomic formula on the RHS labels the corresponding outgoing arc.",
        "Points three and four ensure that labels from all incoming arcs are used in the LHS of the normative transition rule that these arcs enter into, and that the labels from all outgoing arcs are used in the RHS of the normative transition rule that these arcs leave. 3.3 Intended Semantics The formal semantics will be defined via a mapping to Coloured Petri Nets in Section 5.1.",
        "Here we start defining the intended semantics of normative transition rules by describing how a rule changes a normative scene of an existing normative structure yielding a new normative structure.",
        "Each rule is triggered once for each substitution that unifies the left-hand side V of the rule with the state of the corresponding normative scenes.",
        "An atomic formula (i.e. an utterance or a normative position) holds iff it is unifiable with an utterance or normative position that belongs to the state of the corresponding normative scene.",
        "Every time a rule is triggered, the normative command specified on the right-hand side of that rule is carried out, intending to add or remove a normative position from the state of the corresponding normative scene.",
        "However, addition is not unconditional as conflicts may arise.",
        "This topic will be treated in Sections 4 and 6.1. 638 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 3.4 Example In our running example we have the following exemplary normative transition rule: „ payment : obl(inform(X, client, Y, acc, pay(Z, P, Q), T )), payment : utt(inform(X, client, Y, acc, pay(Z, P, Q), T )) « delivery : add(obl(inform(Y, wm, X, client, delivered(Z, Q), T ))) That is, during the payment activity, an obligation on client X to inform accountant Y about the payment P of item Z at time T and the corresponding utterance which fulfills this obligation allows the flow of a norm to the delivery activity.",
        "The norm is an obligation on agent Y (this time taking up the role of the warehouse manager wm) to send a message to client X that item Z has been delivered.",
        "We show in Figure 2 a diagrammatic representation of how activities and a normative structure relate: Payment Delivery Contract Normative Level Exit Registration Payment Delivery Negotiation Coordination Level Contract nt Figure 2: Activities and Normative Structure As illocutions are uttered during activities, normative positions arise.",
        "Utterances and normative positions are combined in transition rules, causing the flow of normative positions between normative scenes.",
        "The connection between the two levels is described in Section 6.2. 4.",
        "CONFLICT DEFINITION The terms deontic conflict and deontic inconsistency have been used interchangeably in the literature.",
        "However, in this paper we adopt the view of [7] in which the authors suggest that a deontic inconsistency arises when an action is simultaneously permitted and prohibited - since a permission may not be acted upon, no real conflict occurs.",
        "The situations when an action is simultaneously obliged and prohibited are, however, deontic conflicts, as both obligations and prohibitions influence behaviours in a conflicting fashion.",
        "The content of normative positions in this paper are illocutions.",
        "Therefore, a normative conflict arises when an illocution is simultaneously obliged and prohibited.",
        "We propose to use the standard notion of unification [9] to detect when a prohibition and a permission overlap.",
        "For instance, an obligation obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) and a prohibition prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) are in conflict as they unify under σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T }).",
        "We formally capture this notion: Def. 9.",
        "A (deontic) conflict arises between two normative positions N and N under a substitution σ, denoted as conflict(N, N , σ), if and only if N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I ) and unify(¯I,¯I , σ).",
        "That is, a prohibition and an obligation are in conflict if, and only if, their illocutions unify under σ.",
        "The substitution σ, called here the conflict set, unifies the agents, roles and atomic formulae.",
        "We assume that unify is a suitable implementation of a unification algorithm which i) always terminates (possibly failing, if a unifier cannot be found); ii) is correct; and iii) has linear computational complexity.",
        "Inconsistencies caused by the same illocution being simultaneously permitted and prohibited can be formalised similarly.",
        "In this paper we focus on prohibition/obligation conflicts, but the computational machinery introduced in Section 6.1 can equally be used to detect prohibition/permission inconsistencies, if we substitute modality obl for per. 5.",
        "FORMALISING CONFLICT-FREEDOM In this section we introduce some background knowledge on CPNs assuming a basic understanding of ordinary Petri Nets.",
        "For technical details we refer the reader to [16].",
        "We then map NSs to CPNs and analyse their properties.",
        "CPNs combine the strength of Petri nets with the strength of functional programming languages.",
        "On the one hand, Petri nets provide the primitives for the description of the synchronisation of concurrent processes.",
        "As noticed in [16], CPNs have a semantics which builds upon true concurrency, instead of interleaving.",
        "In our opinion, a true-concurrency semantics is easier to work with because it is the way we envisage the connection between the coordination level and the normative level of a multi-agent system to be.",
        "On the other hand, the functional programming languages used by CPNs provide the primitives for the definition of data types and the manipulation of their data values.",
        "Thus, we can readily translate expressions of a normative structure.",
        "Last but not least, CPNs have a well-defined semantics which unambiguously defines the behaviour of each CPN.",
        "Furthermore, CPNs have a large number of formal analysis methods and tools by which properties of CPNs can be proved.",
        "Summing up, CPNs provide us with all the necessary features to formally reason about normative structures given that an adequate mapping is provided.",
        "In accordance with Petri nets, the states of a CPN are represented by means of places.",
        "But unlike Petri Nets, each place has an associated data type determining the kind of data which the place may contain.",
        "A state of a CPN is called a marking.",
        "It consists of a number of tokens positioned on the individual places.",
        "Each token carries a data value which has the type of the corresponding place.",
        "In general, a place may contain two or more tokens with the same data value.",
        "Thus, a marking of a CPN is a function which maps each place into a multi-set2 of tokens of the correct type.",
        "One often refers to the token values as token colours and one also refers to the data types as colour sets.",
        "The types of a CPN can be arbitrarily complex.",
        "Actions in a CPN are represented by means of transitions.",
        "An incoming arc into a transition from a place indicates that the transition may remove tokens from the corresponding place while an outgoing arc indicates that the transition may add tokens.",
        "The exact number of tokens and their data values are determined by the arc expressions, which are encoded using the programming language chosen for the CPN.",
        "A transition is enabled in a CPN if and only if all the 2 A multi-set (or bag) is an extension to the notion of set, allowing the possibility of multiple appearances of the same element.",
        "The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 639 variables in the expressions of its incoming arcs are bound to some value(s) (each one of these bindings is referred to as a binding element).",
        "If so, the transition may occur by removing tokens from its input places and adding tokens to its output places.",

        "In accordance with ordinary Petri nets, the concurrent behaviour of a CPN is based on the notion of step.",

        "We are presenting a mapping f from one to the other, in order to provide semantics for the normative structure and prove properties about it by using well-known theoretical results from work on CPNs.",

In future work, this function can be used to model constraints when we extend the expressiveness of our norm language. 5.2 Properties of Normative Structures Having defined the mapping from normative structures to Coloured Petri Nets, we now look at properties of CPNs that help us understand the complexity of conflict detection.",
        "One question we would like to answer is, whether at a given point in time, a given normative structure is conflict-free.",
        "Such a snapshot of a normative structure corresponds to a marking in the mapped CPN.",
        "Def. 11.",
        "Given a marking Mi, this marking is conflictfree if ¬∃p ∈ P. ∃np1, np2 ∈ Mi(p) such that np1.mode = Obl and np2.mode = Prh and np1.illoc and np2.illoc unify under a valid substitution.",
        "Another interesting question would be, whether a conflict will occur from such a snapshot of the system by propagating the normative positions.",
        "In order to answer this question, we first translate the snapshot of the normative structure to the corresponding CPN and then execute the finite occurence sequence of markings and steps, verifying the conflict-freedom of each marking as we go along.",

        "Mn[Sn > Mn+1 and Mk is conflict-free for all k such that i ≤ k ≤ n + 1.",
        "However, the main question we would like to investigate, is whether or not a given normative structure is conflictresistant, that is, whether or not the agents enacting the MAS are able to bring about conflicts through their actions.",

        "These nondeterministic CPNs feed tokens into the CPN that models the normative structure.",
        "This leads to the introduction of non-determinism into the combined CPN.",
        "The lower half of figure 3 shows part of a CPN model of an agent protocol where the arc denoted with 1 represents some utterance of an illocution by an agent.",
        "The target transition of this arc, not only moves a token on to the next state of this CPN, but also places a token in the place corresponding to the appropriate normative scene in the CPN model of the normative structure (via arc 2).",
        "Transition 3 finally could propagate that token in form of an obligation, for example.",
        "Thus, from a given marking, many different occurrence sequences are possible depending on the agents actions.",

        "Given a net N, a marking M is conflict-resistant if and only if all markings in R(N,M) are conflict-free.",

        "Conflict-freedom of an occurrence sequence in the CPN that represents the normative structure can also be done in polynomial time since this sequence is deterministic given a snapshot.",
        "Whether or not a normative structure is designed safely corresponds to checking the conflict-resistance of the initial marking M0.",
        "Now, verifying conflict-resistance of a marking becomes a very difficult task.",
        "It corresponds to the reachability problem in a CPN: can a state be reached or a marking achieved, that contains a conflict?.",
        "This reachability problem is known to be NP-complete for ordinary Petri Nets [22] and since CPNs are functionally identical, we cannot hope to verify conflict-resistance of a normative structure off-line in a reasonable amount of time.",
        "Therefore, distributed, run-time mechanisms are needed to ensure that a normative structure maintains consistency.",
        "We present one such mechanism in the following section. 6.",
        "MANAGING NORMATIVE STRUCTURES Once a conflict (as defined in Section 4) has been detected, we propose to employ the unifier to resolve the conflict.",
        "In our example, if the variables in prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) do not get the values specified in substitution σ then there will not be a conflict.",
        "However, rather than computing the complement set of a substitution (which can be an infinite set) we propose to annotate the prohibition with the unifier itself and use it to determine what the variables of that prohibition cannot be in future unifications in order to avoid a conflict.",
        "We therefore denote annotated prohibitions as prh(¯I) Σ, where Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, is a set of unifiers.",
        "Annotated norms3 are interpreted as deontic constructs with curtailed influences, that is, their effect (on agents, roles and illocutions) has been limited by the set Σ of unifiers.",
        "A prohibition may be in conflict with various obligations in a given normative scene s = id, Δ and we need to record (and possibly avoid) all these conflicts.",
        "We define below an algorithm which ensures that a normative position will be added to a normative scene in such a way that it will not cause any conflicts. 3 Although we propose to curtail prohibitions, the same machinery can be used to define the curtailment of obligations instead.",
        "These different policies are dependent on the intended deontic semantics and requirements of the systems addressed.",
        "For instance, some MASs may require that their agents should not act in the presence of conflicts, that is, the obligation should be curtailed. 6.1 Conflict Resolution We propose a fine-grained way of resolving normative conflicts via unification.",
        "We detect the overlapping of the influences of norms , i.e. how they affect the behaviour of the concerned agents, and we curtail the influence of the normative position, by appropriately using the annotations when checking if the norm applies to illocutions.",
        "The algorithm shown in Figure 4 depicts how we maintain a conflict-free set of norms.",
        "It adds a given norm N to an existing, conflictfree normative state Δ, obtaining a resulting new normative state Δ which is conflict-free, that is, its prohibitions are annotated with a set of conflict sets indicating which bindings for variables have to be avoided for conflicts not to take place. algorithm addNorm(N, Δ) begin 1 timestamp(N) 2 case N of 3 per(¯I): Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 4 prh(I): if N ∈ Δ s.t. conflict(N, N , σ) then Δ := Δ 5 else Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 6 prh(¯I): 7 begin 8 Σ := ∅ 9 for each N ∈ Δ do 10 if conflict(N, N , σ) then Σ := Σ ∪ {σ} 11 Δ := Δ ∪ {N Σ} 12 end 13 obl(¯I): 14 begin 15 Δ1 := ∅; Δ2 := ∅ 16 for each (N Σ) ∈ Δ do 17 if N = prh(I) then 18 if conflict(N , N, σ) then Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 19 else nil 20 else 21 if conflict(N , N, σ) then 22 begin 23 Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 24 Δ2 := Δ2 ∪ {N (Σ ∪ {σ})} 25 end 26 Δ := (Δ − Δ1) ∪ Δ2 ∪ {N} 27 end 28 end case 29 return Δ end Figure 4: Algorithm to Preserve Conflict-Freedom The algorithm uses a case of structure to differentiate the different possibilities for a given norm N. Line 3 addresses the case when the given norm is a permission: N is simply added to Δ.",
        "Lines 4-5 address the case when we attempt to add a ground prohibition to a normative state: if it conflicts with any obligation, then it is discarded; otherwise it is added to the normative state.",
        "Lines 6-12 describe the situation when the normative position to be added is a nonground prohibition.",
        "In this case, the algorithm initialises Σ to an empty set and loops (line 9-10) through the norms N in the old normative state Δ.",
        "Upon finding one that conflicts with N, the algorithm updates Σ by adding the newly found conflict set σ to it (line 10).",
        "By looping through Δ, we are able to check any conflicts between the new prohibition and the existing obligations, adequately building the annotation Σ to be used when adding N to Δ in line 11.",
        "Lines 13-27 describe how a new obligation is accommodated to an existing normative state.",
        "We make use of two initially empty, temporary sets, Δ1, Δ2.",
        "The algorithm loops through Δ (lines 16-25) picking up those annotated prohibitions N Σ which conflict with the new obligation.",
        "There are, however, two cases to deal with: the one when a ground The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 641 prohibition is found (line 17), and its exception, covering non-ground prohibitions (line 20).",
        "In both cases, the old prohibition is stored in Δ1 (lines 18 and 23) to be later removed from Δ (line 26).",
        "However, in the case of a nonground prohibition, the algorithm updates its annotation of conflict sets (line 24).",
        "The loop guarantees that an exhaustive (linear) search through a normative state takes place, checking if the new obligation is in conflict with any existing prohibitions, possibly updating the annotations of these conflicting prohibitions.",
        "In line 26 the algorithm builds the new updated Δ by removing the old prohibitions stored in Δ1 and adding the updated prohibitions stored in Δ2 (if any), as well as the new obligation N. Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations.",
        "The annotations can be empty, though: this is the case when we have a ground prohibition or a prohibition which does not unify/conflict with any obligation.",
        "Permissions do not affect our algorithm and they are appropriately dealt with (line 3).",
        "Any attempt to insert a ground prohibition which conflicts, yields the same normative state (line 4).",
        "When a new obligation is being added then the algorithm guarantees that all prohibitions are considered (lines 14-27), leading to the removal of conflicting ground prohibitions or the update of annotations of non-ground prohibitions.",
        "The algorithm always terminates: the loops are over a finite set Δ and the conflict checks and set operations always terminate.",
        "The complexity of the algorithm is linear: the set Δ is only examined once for each possible case of norm to be added.",
        "When managing normative states we may also need to remove normative positions.",
        "This is straightforward: permissions can be removed without any problems; annotated prohibitions can also be removed without further considerations; obligations, however, require some housekeeping.",
        "When an obligation is to be removed, we must check it against all annotated prohibitions in order to update their annotations.",
        "We apply the conflict check and obtain a unifier, then remove this unifier from the prohibitions annotation.",
        "We invoke the removal algorithm as removeNorm(N, Δ): it returns a new normative state Δ in which N has been removed, with possible alterations to other normative positions as explained. 6.2 Enactment of a Normative Structure The enactment of a normative structure amounts to the parallel, distributed execution of normative scenes and normative transitions.",
        "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
        "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
        "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
        "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
        "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
        "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
        "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
        "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
        "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
        "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
        "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
        "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
        "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
        "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
        "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
        "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
        "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
        "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
        "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
        "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
        "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
        "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
        "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
        "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
        "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
        "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
        "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
        "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
        "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
        "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",
        "The normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets.",
        "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
        "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
        "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
        "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
        "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
        "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
        "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
        "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
        "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
        "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
        "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
        "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
        "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
        "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
        "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
        "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",
        "The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",

                "The relationships are expressed as bridge rules - deducibility of formulae in some contexts leads to the deduction of other formulae in other contexts.",
                "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
                "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",

                "We focus on an expressive class of MASs in which interaction is carried out by means of illocutionary speech acts exchanged among participating agents: Def. 3.",
                "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
                "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",
                "In the description of a protocol, for instance, the precise values of the message exchanged can be left unspecified.",
                "During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution.",

                "An illocution schema ¯I is any atomic formula p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) in which some of the terms may either be variables or may contain variables. 3.2 Formal Definition of the Notion of NS We first define normative scenes as follows: Def. 5.",
                "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request.",
                "Note that the state of a normative scene Δs evolves over time.",
                "These normative scenes are connected to one another via normative transitions that specify how utterances and normative positions in one scene affect other normative scenes.",
                "As mentioned above, activities are not independent since illocutions uttered in some of them may have an effect on other ones.",
                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
                "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",
                "Our transition rules are thus defined: Def. 6.",
                "A normative transition rule R is of the form: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) where ¯I is an illocution schema, N is a normative position (i.e. permission, prohibition or obligation), ids is an identifier for activity s and C is a normative command.",

                "Rules map an existing normative structure to a new normative structure where only the state of the normative scenes change.",

The following must hold: 1.",

                "The first two points ensure that every atomic formulae on the LHS of a normative transition rule labels an arc entering the appropriate normative transition in the normative structure, and that the atomic formula on the RHS labels the corresponding outgoing arc.",

                "An atomic formula (i.e. an utterance or a normative position) holds iff it is unifiable with an utterance or normative position that belongs to the state of the corresponding normative scene.",
                "Every time a rule is triggered, the normative command specified on the right-hand side of that rule is carried out, intending to add or remove a normative position from the state of the corresponding normative scene.",

                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the <br>activity</br> it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",

                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",
                "The normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets.",
                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",
                "The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",

                "In our example, if the variables in prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) do not get the values specified in substitution σ then there will not be a conflict.",
                "However, rather than computing the complement set of a substitution (which can be an infinite set) we propose to annotate the prohibition with the unifier itself and use it to determine what the variables of that prohibition cannot be in future unifications in order to avoid a conflict.",
                "We therefore denote annotated prohibitions as prh(¯I) Σ, where Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, is a set of unifiers.",
                "Annotated norms3 are interpreted as deontic constructs with curtailed influences, that is, their effect (on agents, roles and illocutions) has been limited by the set Σ of unifiers.",

                "For instance, some MASs may require that their agents should not act in the presence of conflicts, that is, the obligation should be curtailed. 6.1 Conflict Resolution We propose a fine-grained way of resolving normative conflicts via unification.",
                "We detect the overlapping of the influences of norms , i.e. how they affect the behaviour of the concerned agents, and we curtail the influence of the <br>normative position</br>, by appropriately using the annotations when checking if the norm applies to illocutions.",

                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",

                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",
                "The normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets.",
                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",
                "The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",

                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",

                "For each <br>normative scene</br>, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment <br>normative scene</br> collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",

                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the <br>normative scene</br> invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",

                "In our example, the payment <br>normative scene</br> would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming <br>normative scene</br> for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment <br>normative scene</br> (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output <br>normative scene</br>.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment <br>normative scene</br>.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery <br>normative scene</br> to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery <br>normative scene</br> would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",
                "The normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets.",
                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",
                "The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",

                "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
                "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
                "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",

                "During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution.",

                "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request.",

                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
                "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",

[2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",

                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",

                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",

                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a <br>normative structure</br>.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",
                "The <br>normative structure</br> we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets.",
                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the <br>normative structure</br>, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of <br>normative structure</br> to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the <br>normative structure</br> makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",
                "The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",

                "For instance, the sellers obligation above must flow (or be propagated) from a negotiation activity to a delivery activity.",
                "Since in an open, regulated MAS one cannot embed normative aspects into the agents design, we adopt the view that the MAS should be supplemented with a separate set of norms that further regulates the behaviour of participating agents.",

                "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
                "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",

                "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request.",

                "As mentioned above, activities are not independent since illocutions uttered in some of them may have an effect on other ones.",
                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
                "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",
                "Our transition rules are thus defined: Def. 6.",
                "A normative transition rule R is of the form: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) where ¯I is an illocution schema, N is a normative position (i.e. permission, prohibition or obligation), ids is an identifier for activity s and C is a normative command.",

                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",

                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",

                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

                "For instance, some MASs may require that their agents should not act in the presence of conflicts, that is, the obligation should be curtailed. 6.1 Conflict Resolution We propose a fine-grained way of resolving normative conflicts via unification.",
                "We detect the overlapping of the influences of norms , i.e. how they affect the behaviour of the concerned agents, and we curtail the influence of the normative position, by appropriately using the annotations when checking if the norm applies to illocutions.",

Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations.",

                "Any attempt to insert a ground <br>prohibition</br> which conflicts, yields the same normative state (line 4).",
                "When a new obligation is being added then the algorithm guarantees that all prohibitions are considered (lines 14-27), leading to the removal of conflicting ground prohibitions or the update of annotations of non-ground prohibitions.",

                "The complexity of the algorithm is linear: the set Δ is only examined once for each possible case of norm to be added.",
                "When managing normative states we may also need to remove normative positions.",
                "This is straightforward: permissions can be removed without any problems; annotated prohibitions can also be removed without further considerations; obligations, however, require some housekeeping.",

                "We apply the conflict check and obtain a unifier, then remove this unifier from the prohibitions annotation.",
                "We invoke the removal algorithm as removeNorm(N, Δ): it returns a new normative state Δ in which N has been removed, with possible alterations to other normative positions as explained. 6.2 Enactment of a Normative Structure The enactment of a normative structure amounts to the parallel, distributed execution of normative scenes and normative transitions.",
                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",
                "The normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets.",
                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of <br>prohibition</br> versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",
                "The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",

                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
                "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",

[2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",

Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations.",

                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",

                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",
                "The normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets.",
                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",
                "The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",

                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",

                "The approach to <br>conflict</br> detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the <br>conflict</br> resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline <br>conflict</br> detection.",

                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",

                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

                "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
                "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",

                "We focus on an expressive class of MASs in which interaction is carried out by means of illocutionary speech acts exchanged among participating agents: Def. 3.",
                "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
                "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",

                "During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution.",

                "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request.",
                "Note that the state of a normative scene Δs evolves over time.",
                "These normative scenes are connected to one another via normative transitions that specify how utterances and normative positions in one scene affect other normative scenes.",
                "As mentioned above, activities are not independent since illocutions uttered in some of them may have an effect on other ones.",
                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
                "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",
                "Our transition rules are thus defined: Def. 6.",
                "A normative transition rule R is of the form: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) where ¯I is an illocution schema, N is a normative position (i.e. permission, prohibition or obligation), ids is an identifier for activity s and C is a normative command.",

                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",

                "The loop guarantees that an exhaustive (linear) search through a normative state takes place, checking if the new obligation is in conflict with any existing prohibitions, possibly updating the annotations of these conflicting prohibitions.",
                "In line 26 the algorithm builds the new updated Δ by removing the old prohibitions stored in Δ1 and adding the updated prohibitions stored in Δ2 (if any), as well as the new obligation N. Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations.",
                "The annotations can be empty, though: this is the case when we have a ground prohibition or a prohibition which does not unify/conflict with any obligation.",
                "Permissions do not affect our algorithm and they are appropriately dealt with (line 3).",
                "Any attempt to insert a ground prohibition which conflicts, yields the same normative state (line 4).",
                "When a new obligation is being added then the algorithm guarantees that all prohibitions are considered (lines 14-27), leading to the removal of conflicting ground prohibitions or the update of annotations of non-ground prohibitions.",
                "The algorithm always terminates: the loops are over a finite set Δ and the conflict checks and set operations always terminate.",
                "The complexity of the algorithm is linear: the set Δ is only examined once for each possible case of norm to be added.",
                "When managing normative states we may also need to remove normative positions.",
                "This is straightforward: permissions can be removed without any problems; annotated prohibitions can also be removed without further considerations; obligations, however, require some housekeeping.",

                "We apply the conflict check and obtain a unifier, then remove this unifier from the prohibitions annotation.",
                "We invoke the removal algorithm as removeNorm(N, Δ): it returns a new normative state Δ in which N has been removed, with possible alterations to other normative positions as explained. 6.2 Enactment of a Normative Structure The enactment of a normative structure amounts to the parallel, distributed execution of normative scenes and normative transitions.",
                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",
                "The normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets.",
                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for <br>electronic institution</br>s (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow <br>electronic institution</br>s with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",
                "The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",

                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",

                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",

                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",

                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",

                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

                "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
                "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",

                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
                "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",

                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different <br>coordination</br> models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",
                "The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",
