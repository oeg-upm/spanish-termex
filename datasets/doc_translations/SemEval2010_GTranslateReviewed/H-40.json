Previously, the suggested terms are mostly in the same language of the input query. In this paper, we extend it to cross-lingual query suggestion (CLQS): for a query in one language, we suggest similar or relevant queries in other languages. This is very important to scenarios of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) and cross-lingual keyword bidding for search engine advertisement. Instead of relying on existing query translation technologies for CLQS, we present an effective means to map the input query of one language to queries of the other language in the query log. Important monolingual and cross-lingual information such as word translation relations and word co-occurrence statistics, etc. are used to estimate the cross-lingual query similarity with a discriminative model. Benchmarks show that the resulting CLQS system significantly outperforms a baseline system based on dictionary-based query translation. Besides, the resulting CLQS is tested with French to English CLIR tasks on TREC collections. The results demonstrate higher effectiveness than the traditional query translation methods.

INTRODUCTION Query suggestion is a functionality to help users of a search engine to better specify their information need, by narrowing down or expanding the scope of the search with synonymous queries and relevant queries, or by suggesting related queries that have been frequently used by other users. Search engines, such as Google, Yahoo!, MSN, Ask Jeeves, all have implemented query suggestion functionality as a valuable addition to their core search method. In addition, the same technology has been leveraged to recommend bidding terms to online advertiser in the pay-forperformance search market [12]. Query suggestion is closely related to query expansion which extends the original query with new search terms to narrow the scope of the search. But different from query expansion, query suggestion aims to suggest full queries that have been formulated by users so that the query integrity and coherence are preserved in the suggested queries. Typical methods for query suggestion exploit query logs and document collections, by assuming that in the same period of time, many users share the same or similar interests, which can be expressed in different manners [12, 14, 26]. By suggesting the related and frequently used formulations, it is hoped that the new query can cover more relevant documents. However, all of the existing studies dealt with monolingual query suggestion and to our knowledge, there is no published study on cross-lingual query suggestion (CLQS). CLQS aims to suggest related queries but in a different language. It has wide applications on World Wide Web: for cross-language search or for suggesting relevant bidding terms in a different language. 1 CLQS can be approached as a query translation problem, i.e., to suggest the queries that are translations of the original query. Dictionaries, large size of parallel corpora and existing commercial machine translation systems can be used for translation. However, these kinds of approaches usually rely on static knowledge and data. It cannot effectively reflect the quickly shifting interests of Web users. Moreover, there are some problems with translated queries in target language. For instance, the translated terms can be reasonable translations, but they are not popularly used in the target language. For example, the French query aliment biologique is translated into biologic food by Google translation tool2 , yet the correct formulation nowadays should be organic food. Therefore, there exist many mismatch cases between the translated terms and the really used terms in target language. This mismatch makes the suggested terms in the target language ineffective. A natural thinking of solving this mismatch is to map the queries in the source language and the queries in the target language, by using the query log of a search engine. We exploit the fact that the users of search engines in the same period of time have similar interests, and they submit queries on similar topics in different languages. As a result, a query written in a source language likely has an equivalent in a query log in the target language. In particular, if the user intends to perform CLIR, then original query is even more likely to have its correspondent included in the target language query log. Therefore, if a candidate for CLQS appears often in the query log, then it is more likely the appropriate one to be suggested. In this paper, we propose a method of calculating the similarity between source language query and the target language query by exploiting, in addition to the translation information, a wide spectrum of bilingual and monolingual information, such as term co-occurrences, query logs with click-through data, etc. A discriminative model is used to learn the cross-lingual query similarity based on a set of manually translated queries. The model is trained by optimizing the cross-lingual similarity to best fit the monolingual similarity between one query and the other querys translation. Besides being benchmarked as an independent module, the resulting CLQS system is tested as a new means of query translation in CLIR task on TREC collections. The results show that this new translation method is more effective than the traditional query translation method. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the related work; Section 3 describes in detail the discriminative model for estimating cross-lingual query similarity; Section 4 presents a new CLIR approach using cross-lingual query suggestion as a bridge across language boundaries. Section 5 discusses the experiments and benchmarks; finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6. 2. RELATED WORK Most approaches to CLIR perform a query translation followed by a monolingual IR. Typically, queries are translated either using a bilingual dictionary [22], a machine translation software [9] or a parallel corpus [20]. Despite the various types of resources used, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and translation disambiguation are the two major bottlenecks for CLIR [20]. In [7, 27], OOV term translations are mined from the Web using a search engine. In [17], bilingual knowledge is acquired based on anchor text analysis. In addition, word co-occurrence statistics in the target language has been leveraged for translation disambiguation [3, 10, 11, 19]. 2 http://www.google.com/language_tools Nevertheless, it is arguable that accurate query translation may not be necessary for CLIR. Indeed, in many cases, it is helpful to introduce words even if they are not direct translations of any query word, but are closely related to the meaning of the query. This observation has led to the development of cross-lingual query expansion (CLQE) techniques [2, 16, 18]. [2] reports the enhancement on CLIR by post-translation expansion. [16] develops a cross-lingual relevancy model by leveraging the crosslingual co-occurrence statistics in parallel texts. [18] makes performance comparison on multiple CLQE techniques, including pre-translation expansion and post-translation expansion. However, there is lack of a unified framework to combine the wide spectrum of resources and recent advances of mining techniques for CLQE. CLQS is different from CLQE in that it aims to suggest full queries that have been formulated by users in another language. As CLQS exploits up-to-date query logs, it is expected that for most user queries, we can find common formulations on these topics in the query log in the target language. Therefore, CLQS also plays a role of adapting the original query formulation to the common formulations of similar topics in the target language. Query logs have been successfully used for monolingual IR [8, 12, 15, 26], especially in monolingual query suggestions [12] and relating the semantically relevant terms for query expansion [8, 15]. In [1], the target language query log has been exploited to help query translation in CLIR. 3. ESTIMATING CROSS-LINGUAL QUERY SIMILARITY A search engine has a query log containing user queries in different languages within a certain period of time. In addition to query terms, click-through information is also recorded. Therefore, we know which documents have been selected by users for each query. Given a query in the source language, our CLQS task is to determine one or several similar queries in the target language from the query log. The key problem with cross-lingual query suggestion is how to learn a similarity measure between two queries in different languages. Although various statistical similarity measures have been studied for monolingual terms [8, 26], most of them are based on term co-occurrence statistics, and can hardly be applied directly in cross-lingual settings. In order to define a similarity measure across languages, one has to use at least one translation tool or resource. So the measure is based on both translation relation and monolingual similarity. In this paper, as our purpose is to provide up-to-date query similarity measure, it may not be sufficient to use only a static translation resource. Therefore, we also integrate a method to mine possible translations on the Web. This method is particularly useful for dealing with OOV terms. Given a set of resources of different natures, the next question is how to integrate them in a principled manner. In this paper, we propose a discriminative model to learn the appropriate similarity measure. The principle is as follows: we assume that we have a reasonable monolingual query similarity measure. For any training query example for which a translation exists, its similarity measure (with any other query) is transposed to its translation. Therefore, we have the desired cross-language similarity value for this example. Then we use a discriminative model to learn the cross-language similarity function which fits the best these examples. In the following sections, let us first describe the detail of the discriminative model for cross-lingual query similarity estimation. Then we introduce all the features (monolingual and cross-lingual information) that we will use in the discriminative model. 3.1 Discriminative Model for Estimating Cross-Lingual Query Similarity In this section, we propose a discriminative model to learn crosslingual query similarities in a principled manner. The principle is as follows: for a reasonable monolingual query similarity between two queries, a cross-lingual correspondent can be deduced between one query and another querys translation. In other words, for a pair of queries in different languages, their crosslingual similarity should fit the monolingual similarity between one query and the other querys translation. For example, the similarity between French query pages jaunes (i.e., yellow page in English) and English query telephone directory should be equal to the monolingual similarity between the translation of the French query yellow page and telephone directory. There are many ways to obtain a monolingual similarity measure between terms, e.g., term co-occurrence based mutual information and 2 χ . Any of them can be used as the target for the cross-lingual similarity function to fit. In this way, cross-lingual query similarity estimation is formulated as a regression task as follows: Given a source language query fq , a target language query eq , and a monolingual query similarity MLsim , the corresponding cross-lingual query similarity CLsim is defined as follows: ),(),( eqMLefCL qTsimqqsim f = (1) where fqT is the translation of fq in the target language. Based on Equation (1), it would be relatively easy to create a training corpus. All it requires is a list of query translations. Then an existing monolingual query suggestion system can be used to automatically produce similar query to each translation, and create the training corpus for cross-lingual similarity estimation. Another advantage is that it is fairly easy to make use of arbitrary information sources within a discriminative modeling framework to achieve optimal performance. In this paper, support vector machine (SVM) regression algorithm [25] is used to learn the cross-lingual term similarity function. Given a vector of feature functions f between fq and eq , ),( efCL ttsim is represented as an inner product between a weight vector and the feature vector in a kernel space as follows: )),((),( efefCL ttfwttsim φ•= (2) where φ is the mapping from the input feature space onto the kernel space, and wis the weight vector in the kernel space which will be learned by the SVM regression training. Once the weight vector is learned, the Equation (2) can be used to estimate the similarity between queries of different languages. We want to point out that instead of regression, one can definitely simplify the task as a binary or ordinal classification, in which case CLQS can be categorized according to discontinuous class labels, e.g., relevant and irrelevant, or a series of levels of relevancies, e.g., strongly relevant, weakly relevant, and irrelevant. In either case, one can resort to discriminative classification approaches, such as an SVM or maximum entropy model, in a straightforward way. However, the regression formalism enables us to fully rank the suggested queries based on the similarity score given by Equation (1). The Equations (1) and (2) construct a regression model for cross-lingual query similarity estimation. In the following sections, the monolingual query similarity measure (see Section 3.2) and the feature functions used for SVM regression (see Section 3.3) will be presented. 3.2 Monolingual Query Similarity Measure Based on Click-through Information Any monolingual term similarity measure can be used as the regression target. In this paper, we select the monolingual query similarity measure presented in [26] which reports good performance by using search users click-through information in query logs. The reason to choose this monolingual similarity is that it is defined in a similar context as ours − according to a user log that reflects users intention and behavior. Therefore, we can expect that the cross-language term similarity learned from it can also reflect users intention and expectation. Following [26], our monolingual query similarity is defined by combining both query content-based similarity and click-through commonality in the query log. First the content similarity between two queries p and q is defined as follows: ))(),(( ),( ),( qknpknMax qpKN qpsimilarity content = (3) where )( xkn is the number of keywords in a query x, ),( qpKN is the number of common keywords in the two queries. Secondly, the click-through based similarity is defined as follows, ))(),(( ),( ),( qrdprdMax qpRD qpsimilarity throughclick =− (4) where )(xrd is the number of clicked URLs for a query x, and ),( qpRD is the number of common URLs clicked for two queries. Finally, the similarity between two queries is a linear combination of the content-based and click-through-based similarities, and is presented as follows: ),(* ),(*),( qpsimilarity qpsimilarityqpsimilarity throughclick content − += β α (5) where α and β are the relative importance of the two similarity measures. In this paper, we set ,4.0=α and 6.0=β following the practice in [26]. Queries with similarity measure higher than a threshold with another query will be regarded as relevant monolingual query suggestions (MLQS) for the latter. In this paper, the threshold is set as 0.9 empirically. 3.3 Features Used for Learning Cross-Lingual Query Similarity Measure This section presents the extraction of candidate relevant queries from the log with the assistance of various monolingual and bilingual resources. Meanwhile, feature functions over source query and the cross-lingual relevant candidates are defined. Some of the resources being used here, such as bilingual lexicon and parallel corpora, were for query translation in previous work. But note that we employ them here as an assistant means for finding relevant candidates in the log rather than for acquiring accurate translations. 3.3.1 Bilingual Dictionary In this subsection, a built-in-house bilingual dictionary containing 120,000 unique entries is used to retrieve candidate queries. Since multiple translations may be associated with each source word, co-occurrence based translation disambiguation is performed [3, 10]. The process is presented as follows: Given an input query }{ ,2,1 fnfff wwwq K= in the source language, for each query term fiw , a set of unique translations are provided by the bilingual dictionary D : },,{)( ,2,1 imiifi tttwD K= . Then the cohesion between the translations of two query terms is measured using mutual information which is computed as follows: )()( ),( log),()( , klij klij klijklij tPtP ttP ttPttMI = (6) where . )( )(, ),( ),( N tC tP N ttC ttP klij klij == Here ),( yxC is the number of queries in the log containing both x and y , )(xC is the number of queries containing term x , and N is the total number of queries in the log. Based on the term-term cohesion defined in Equation (6), all the possible query translations are ranked using the summation of the term-term cohesion ∑≠ = kiki klijqdict ttMITS f ,, ),()( . The set of top-4 query translations is denoted as )( fqTS . For each possible query translation )( fqTST∈ , we retrieve all the queries containing the same keywords as T from the target language log. The retrieved queries are candidate target queries, and are assigned )(TSdict as the value of the feature Dictionary-based Translation Score. 3.3.2 Parallel Corpora Parallel corpora are precious resources for bilingual knowledge acquisition. Different from the bilingual dictionary, the bilingual knowledge learned from parallel corpora assigns probability for each translation candidate which is useful in acquiring dominant query translations. In this paper, the Europarl corpus (a set of parallel French and English texts from the proceedings of the European Parliament) is used. The corpus is first sentence aligned. Then word alignments are derived by training an IBM translation model 1 [4] using GIZA++ [21]. The learned bilingual knowledge is used to extract candidate queries from the query log. The process is presented as follows: Given a pair of queries, fq in the source language and eq in the target language, the Bi-Directional Translation Score is defined as follows: )|()|(),( 111 feIBMefIBMefIBM qqpqqpqqS = (7) where )|(1 xypIBM is the word sequence translation probability given by IBM model 1 which has the following form: ∏∑= =+ = || 1 || 0 ||1 )|( )1|(| 1 )|( y j x i ijyIBM xyp x xyp (8) where )|( ij xyp is the word to word translation probability derived from the word-aligned corpora. The reason to use bidirectional translation probability is to deal with the fact that common words can be considered as possible translations of many words. By using bidirectional translation, we test whether the translation words can be translated back to the source words. This is helpful to focus on the translation probability onto the most specific translation candidates. Now, given an input query fq , the top 10 queries }{ eq with the highest bidirectional translation scores with fq are retrieved from the query log, and ),(1 efIBM qqS in Equation (7) is assigned as the value for the feature Bi-Directional Translation Score. 3.3.3 Online Mining for Related Queries OOV word translation is a major knowledge bottleneck for query translation and CLIR. To overcome this knowledge bottleneck, web mining has been exploited in [7, 27] to acquire EnglishChinese term translations based on the observation that Chinese terms may co-occur with their English translations in the same web page. In this section, this web mining approach is adapted to acquire not only translations but semantically related queries in the target language. It is assumed that if a query in the target language co-occurs with the source query in many web pages, they are probably semantically related. Therefore, a simple method is to send the source query to a search engine (Google in our case) for Web pages in the target language in order to find related queries in the target language. For instance, by sending a French query pages jaunes to search for English pages, the English snippets containing the key words yellow pages or telephone directory will be returned. However, this simple approach may induce significant amount of noise due to the non-relevant returns from the search engine. In order to improve the relevancy of the bilingual snippets, we extend the simple approach by the following query modification: the original query is used to search with the dictionary-based query keyword translations, which are unified by the ∧ (and) ∨ (OR) operators into a single Boolean query. For example, for a given query abcq = where the set of translation entries in the dictionary of for a is },,{ 321 aaa , b is },{ 21 bb and c is }{ 1c , we issue 121321 )()( cbbaaaq ∧∨∧∨∨∧ as one web query. From the returned top 700 snippets, the most frequent 10 target queries are identified, and are associated with the feature Frequency in the Snippets. Furthermore, we use Co-Occurrence Double-Check (CODC) Measure to weight the association between the source and target queries. CODC Measure is proposed in [6] as an association measure based on snippet analysis, named Web Search with Double Checking (WSDC) model. In WSDC model, two objects a and b are considered to have an association if b can be found by using a as query (forward process), and a can be found by using b as query (backward process) by web search. The forward process counts the frequency of b in the top N snippets of query a, denoted as )@( abfreq . Similarly, the backward process count the frequency of a in the top N snippets of query b, denoted as )@( bafreq . Then the CODC association score is defined as follows: ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ ⎨ ⎧ =× = ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ ⎤ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ ⎡ × otherwise, 0)@()@(if,0 ),( )( )@( )( )@( log α e ef f fe qfreq qqfreq qfreq qqfreq effe efCODC e qqfreqqqfreq qqS (9) CODC measures the association of two terms in the range between 0 and 1, where under the two extreme cases, eq and fq are of no association when 0)@( =fe qqfreq or 0)@( =ef qqfreq , and are of the strongest association when )()@( ffe qfreqqqfreq = and )()@( eef qfreqqqfreq = . In our experiment, α is set at 0.15 following the practice in [6]. Any query eq mined from the Web will be associated with a feature CODC Measure with ),( efCODC qqS as its value. 3.3.4 Monolingual Query Suggestion For all the candidate queries 0Q being retrieved using dictionary (see Section 3.3.1), parallel data (see Section 3.3.2) and web mining (see Section 3.3.3), monolingual query suggestion system (described in Section 3.1) is called to produce more related queries in the target language. For each target query eq , its monolingual source query )( eML qSQ is defined as the query in 0Q with the highest monolingual similarity with eq , i.e., ),(maxarg)( 0 eeMLQqeML qqsimqSQ e ′= ∈′ (10) Then the monolingual similarity between eq and )( eML qSQ is used as the value of the eq s Monolingual Query Suggestion Feature. For any target query 0Qq∈ , its Monolingual Query Suggestion Feature is set as 1. For any query 0Qqe ∉ , its values of Dictionary-based Translation Score, Bi-Directional Translation Score, Frequency in the Snippet, and CODC Measure are set to be equal to the feature values of )( eML qSQ . 3.4 Estimating Cross-lingual Query Similarity In summary, four categories of features are used to learn the crosslingual query similarity. SVM regression algorithm [25] is used to learn the weights in Equation (2). In this paper, LibSVM toolkit [5] is used for the regression training. In the prediction stage, the candidate queries will be ranked using the cross-lingual query similarity score computed in terms of )),((),( efefCL ttfwttsim φ•= , and the queries with similarity score lower than a threshold will be regarded as nonrelevant. The threshold is learned using a development data set by fitting MLQSs output. 4. CLIR BASED ON CROSS-LINGUAL QUERY SUGGESTION In Section 3, we presented a discriminative model for cross lingual query suggestion. However, objectively benchmarking a query suggestion system is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose to use CLQS as an alternative to query translation, and test its effectiveness in CLIR tasks. The resulting good performance of CLIR corresponds to the high quality of the suggested queries. Given a source query fq , a set of relevant queries }{ eq in the target language are recommended using the cross-lingual query suggestion system. Then a monolingual IR system based on the BM25 model [23] is called using each }{ eqq∈ as queries to retrieve documents. Then the retrieved documents are re-ranked based on the sum of the BM25 scores associated with each monolingual retrieval. 5. PERFORMACNCE EVALUATION In this section, we will benchmark the cross-lingual query suggestion system, comparing its performance with monolingual query suggestion, studying the contribution of various information sources, and testing its effectiveness when being used in CLIR tasks. 5.1 Data Resources In our experiments, French and English are selected as the source and target language respectively. Such selection is due to the fact that large scale query logs are readily available for these two languages. A one-month English query log (containing 7 million unique English queries with occurrence frequency more than 5) of MSN search engine is used as the target language log. And a monolingual query suggestion system is built based on it. In addition, 5,000 French queries are selected randomly from a French query log (containing around 3 million queries), and are manually translated into English by professional French-English translators. Among the 5,000 French queries, 4,171 queries have their translations in the English query log, and are used for CLQS training and testing. Furthermore, among the 4,171 French queries, 70% are used for cross-lingual query similarity training, 10% are used as the development data to determine the relevancy threshold, and 20% are used for testing. To retrieve the crosslingual related queries, a built-in-house French-English bilingual lexicon (containing 120,000 unique entries) and the Europarl corpus are used. Besides benchmarking CLQS as an independent system, the CLQS is also tested as a query translation system for CLIR tasks. Based on the observation that the CLIR performance heavily relies on the quality of the suggested queries, this benchmark measures the quality of CLQS in terms of its effectiveness in helping CLIR. To perform such benchmark, we use the documents of TREC6 CLIR data (AP88-90 newswire, 750MB) with officially provided 25 short French-English queries pairs (CL1-CL25). The selection of this data set is due to the fact that the average length of the queries are 3.3 words long, which matches the web query logs we use to train CLQS. 5.2 Performance of Cross-lingual Query Suggestion Mean-square-error (MSE) is used to measure the regression error and it is defined as follows: ( )2 ),(),( 1 ∑ −= i eiqMLeifiCL qTsimqqsim l MSE fi where l is the total number of cross-lingual query pairs in the testing data. As described in Section 3.4, a relevancy threshold is learned using the development data, and only CLQS with similarity value above the threshold is regarded as truly relevant to the input query. In this way, CLQS can also be benchmarked as a classification task using precision (P) and recall (R) which are defined as follows: CLQS MLQSCLQS P S SS I = , MLQS MLQSCLQS R S SS I = where CLQSS is the set of relevant queries suggested by CLQS, MLQSS is the set of relevant queries suggested by MLQS (see Section 3.2). The benchmarking results with various feature configurations are shown in Table 1. Regression Classification Features MSE P R DD 0.274 0.723 0.098 DD+PC 0.224 0.713 0.125 DD+PC+ Web 0.115 0.808 0.192 DD+PC+ Web+ML QS 0.174 0.796 0.421 Table 1. CLQS performance with different feature settings (DD: dictionary only; DD+PC: dictionary and parallel corpora; DD+PC+Web: dictionary, parallel corpora, and web mining; DD+PC+Web+MLQS: dictionary, parallel corpora, web mining and monolingual query suggestion) Table 1 reports the performance comparison with various feature settings. The baseline system (DD) uses a conventional query translation approach, i.e., a bilingual dictionary with cooccurrence-based translation disambiguation. The baseline system only covers less than 10% of the suggestions made by MLQS. Using additional features obviously enables CLQS to generate more relevant queries. The most significant improvement on recall is achieved by exploiting MLQS. The final CLQS system is able to generate 42% of the queries suggested by MLQS. Among all the feature combinations, there is no significant change in precision. This indicates that our methods can improve the recall by effectively leveraging various information sources without losing the accuracy of the suggestions. Besides benchmarking CLQS by comparing its output with MLQS output, 200 French queries are randomly selected from the French query log. These queries are double-checked to make sure that they are not in the CLQS training corpus. Then CLQS system is used to suggest relevant English queries for them. On average, for each French query, 8.7 relevant English queries are suggested. Then the total 1,740 suggested English queries are manually checked by two professional English/French translators with cross-validation. Among the 1,747 suggested queries, 1,407 queries are recognized as relevant to the original ones, hence the accuracy is 80.9%. Figure 1 shows an example of CLQS of the French query terrorisme international (international terrorism in English). 5.3 CLIR Performance In this section, CLQS is tested with French to English CLIR tasks. We conduct CLIR experiments using the TREC 6 CLIR dataset described in Section 5.1. The CLIR is performed using a query translation system followed by a BM25-based [23] monolingual IR module. The following three different systems have been used to perform query translation: (1) CLQS: our CLQS system; (2) MT: Google French to English machine translation system; (3) DT: a dictionary based query translation system using cooccurrence statistics for translation disambiguation. The translation disambiguation algorithm is presented in Section 3.3.1. Besides, the monolingual IR performance is also reported as a reference. The average precision of the four IR systems are reported in Table 2, and the 11-point precision-recall curves are shown in Figure 2. Table 2. Average precision of CLIR on TREC 6 Dataset (Monolingual: monolingual IR system; MT: CLIR based on machine translation; DT: CLIR based on dictionary translation; CLQS: CLQS-based CLIR) IR System Average Precision % of Monolingual IR Monolingual 0.266 100% MT 0.217 81.6% DT 0.186 69.9% CLQS 0.233 87.6% Figure 1. An example of CLQS of the French query terrorisme international international terrorism (0.991); what is terrorism (0.943); counter terrorism (0.920); terrorist (0.911); terrorist attacks (0.898); international terrorist (0.853); world terrorism (0.845); global terrorism (0.833); transnational terrorism (0.821); human rights (0.811); terrorist groups (0. 777); patterns of global terrorism (0.762) september 11 (0.734) 11-point P-R curves (TREC6) 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Recall Precison Monolingual MT DT CLQS The benchmark shows that using CLQS as a query translation tool outperforms CLIR based on machine translation by 7.4%, outperforms CLIR based on dictionary translation by 25.2%, and achieves 87.6% of the monolingual IR performance. The effectiveness of CLQS lies in its ability in suggesting closely related queries besides accurate translations. For example, for the query CL14 terrorisme international (international terrorism), although the machine translation tool translates the query correctly, CLQS system still achieves higher score by recommending many additional related terms such as global terrorism, world terrorism, etc. (as shown in Figure 1). Another example is the query La pollution causée par lautomobile (air pollution due to automobile) of CL6. The MT tool provides the translation the pollution caused by the car, while CLQS system enumerates all the possible synonyms of car, and suggest the following queries car pollution, auto pollution, automobile pollution. Besides, other related queries such as global warming are also suggested. For the query CL12 La culture écologique (organic farming), the MT tool fails to generate the correct translation. Although the correct translation is neither in our French-English dictionary, CLQS system generates organic farm as a relevant query due to successful web mining. The above experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of using CLQS to suggest relevant queries for CLIR enhancement. A related research is to perform query expansion to enhance CLIR [2, 18]. So it is very interesting to compare the CLQS approach with the conventional query expansion approaches. Following [18], post-translation expansion is performed based on pseudorelevance feedback (PRF) techniques. We first perform CLIR in the same way as before. Then we use the traditional PRF algorithm described in [24] to select expansion terms. In our experiments, the top 10 terms are selected to expand the original query, and the new query is used to search the collection for the second time. The new CLIR performance in terms of average precision is shown in Table 3. The 11-point P-R curves are drawn in Figure 3. Although being enhanced by pseudo-relevance feedback, the CLIR using either machine translation or dictionary-based query translation still does not perform as well as CLQS-based approach. Statistical t-test [13] is conducted to indicate whether the CLQS-based CLIR performs significantly better. Pair-wise pvalues are shown in Table 4. Clearly, CLQS significantly outperforms MT and DT without PRF as well as DT+PRF, but its superiority over MT+PRF is not significant. However, when combined with PRF, CLQS significant outperforms all the other methods. This indicates the higher effectiveness of CLQS in related term identification by leveraging a wide spectrum of resources. Furthermore, post-translation expansion is capable of improving CLQS-based CLIR. This is due to the fact that CLQS and pseudo-relevance feedback are leveraging different categories of resources, and both approaches can be complementary.

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we proposed a new approach to cross-lingual query suggestion by mining relevant queries in different languages from query logs. The key solution to this problem is to learn a crosslingual query similarity measure by a discriminative model exploiting multiple monolingual and bilingual resources. The model is trained based on the principle that cross-lingual similarity should best fit the monolingual similarity between one query and the other querys translation.

Here pvalue < 0.05 is considered statistically significant The baseline CLQS system applies a typical query translation approach, using a bilingual dictionary with co-occurrence-based translation disambiguation. This approach only covers 10% of the relevant queries suggested by an MLQS system (when the exact translation of the original query is given). By leveraging additional resources such as parallel corpora, web mining and logbased monolingual query expansion, the final system is able to cover 42% of the relevant queries suggested by an MLQS system with precision as high as 79.6%. To further test the quality of the suggested queries, CLQS system is used as a query translation system in CLIR tasks. Benchmarked using TREC 6 French to English CLIR task, CLQS demonstrates higher effectiveness than the traditional query translation methods using either bilingual dictionary or commercial machine translation tools. The improvement on TREC French to English CLIR task by using CLQS demonstrates the high quality of the suggested queries. This also shows the strong correspondence between the input French queries and English queries in the log. In the future, we will build CLQS system between languages which may be more loosely correlated, e.g., English and Chinese, and study the CLQS performance change due to the less strong correspondence among queries in such languages. 7.

    "original_translation": "Sugerencia de consulta interlingüística utilizando registros de consultas de diferentes idiomas wei gao1*, Cheng Niu2, Jian-yun Nie3, Ming Zhou2, Jian Hu2, Kam-Fai Wong1, Hsiao-Wuen Hon2 1 La Universidad China de Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China{WGAO, kfwong}@se.cuhk.edu.hk 2 Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China {Chengniu, Mingzhou, Jianh, Hon}@microsoft.com 3 Université De Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canadá nie@iro.umonreal.La sugerencia de consulta de resumen de CA tiene como objetivo sugerir consultas relevantes para una consulta determinada, que ayudan a los usuarios a especificar mejor sus necesidades de información. Anteriormente, los términos sugeridos están principalmente en el mismo idioma de la consulta de entrada. En este artículo, lo extendemos a sugerencia de consulta interlingüal (CLQ): para una consulta en un idioma, sugerimos consultas similares o relevantes en otros idiomas. Esto es muy importante para los escenarios de recuperación de información de idioma cruzado (CLIR) y ofertas de palabras clave multilingües para el anuncio de los motores de búsqueda. En lugar de confiar en las tecnologías de traducción de consultas existentes para los CLQ, presentamos un medio efectivo para mapear la consulta de entrada de un idioma a consultas del otro idioma en el registro de consultas. Información monolingüe y interlingüística importante, como las relaciones de traducción de palabras y las estadísticas de co-ocurrencia de palabras, etc., se utilizan para estimar la similitud de consulta interlingüística con un modelo discriminativo. Los puntos de referencia muestran que el sistema CLQS resultante supera significativamente un sistema de referencia basado en la traducción de consultas basada en el diccionario. Además, el CLQS resultante se prueba con tareas de CLIR francés a inglés en colecciones TREC. Los resultados demuestran una mayor efectividad que los métodos tradicionales de traducción de consultas. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y recuperación de información]: Búsqueda y recuperación de información - Formulación de consulta Algoritmos de términos generales, rendimiento, experimentación, teoría.1. La sugerencia de consulta de introducción es una funcionalidad para ayudar a los usuarios de un motor de búsqueda a especificar mejor su necesidad de información, reduciendo o expandiendo el alcance de la búsqueda con consultas sinónimas y consultas relevantes, o sugiriendo consultas relacionadas que otros usuarios han utilizado con frecuencia. Los motores de búsqueda, como Google, Yahoo!, MSN, Ask Jeeves, todos han implementado la funcionalidad de sugerencias de consultas como una valiosa adición a su método de búsqueda central. Además, se ha aprovechado la misma tecnología para recomendar los términos de licitación al anunciante en línea en el mercado de búsqueda de rendimiento salarial [12]. La sugerencia de consulta está estrechamente relacionada con la expansión de la consulta que extiende la consulta original con nuevos términos de búsqueda para reducir el alcance de la búsqueda. Pero diferente de la expansión de la consulta, la sugerencia de consulta tiene como objetivo sugerir consultas completas que han sido formuladas por los usuarios para que la integridad y la coherencia de la consulta se conserven en las consultas sugeridas. Métodos típicos para la sugerencia de consulta Explotación de registros de consultas y colecciones de documentos, al suponer que en el mismo período de tiempo, muchos usuarios comparten los mismos intereses o similares, que pueden expresarse en diferentes modales [12, 14, 26]. Al sugerir las formulaciones relacionadas y utilizadas con frecuencia, se espera que la nueva consulta pueda cubrir documentos más relevantes. Sin embargo, todos los estudios existentes se ocuparon de sugerencias de consulta monolingüe y que sabemos, no hay un estudio publicado sobre sugerencia de consulta interlingüística (CLQ). CLQS tiene como objetivo sugerir consultas relacionadas pero en un lenguaje diferente. Tiene amplias aplicaciones en la World Wide Web: para la búsqueda en forma de lenguaje o para sugerir términos de licitación relevantes en un idioma diferente.1 CLQS puede abordarse como un problema de traducción de consultas, es decir, sugerir las consultas que son traducciones de la consulta original. Los diccionarios, el gran tamaño de los corpus paralelos y los sistemas de traducción automática comercial existentes se pueden utilizar para la traducción. Sin embargo, este tipo de enfoques generalmente dependen del conocimiento y los datos estáticos. No puede reflejar efectivamente los intereses que cambian rápidamente de los usuarios web. Además, hay algunos problemas con las consultas traducidas en el lenguaje de destino. Por ejemplo, los términos traducidos pueden ser traducciones razonables, pero no se usan popularmente en el idioma de destino. Por ejemplo, la consulta francesa Aliment Biologique se traduce en alimentos biológicos por Google Translation Tool2, sin embargo, la formulación correcta hoy en día debería ser alimentos orgánicos. Por lo tanto, existen muchos casos de desajuste entre los términos traducidos y los términos realmente utilizados en el lenguaje de destino. Este desajuste hace que los términos sugeridos en el lenguaje de destino sean ineficaces. Un pensamiento natural de resolver este desajuste es mapear las consultas en el lenguaje de origen y las consultas en el idioma de destino, utilizando el registro de consulta de un motor de búsqueda. Explotamos el hecho de que los usuarios de los motores de búsqueda en el mismo período de tiempo tienen intereses similares, y envían consultas sobre temas similares en diferentes idiomas. Como resultado, una consulta escrita en un lenguaje fuente probablemente tenga un equivalente en un registro de consulta en el idioma de destino. En particular, si el usuario tiene la intención de realizar CLIR, es aún más probable que la consulta original tenga su corresponsal incluido en el registro de consulta de idiomas de destino. Por lo tanto, si un candidato para CLQ aparece a menudo en el registro de consultas, entonces es más probable que se sugiera el apropiado. En este documento, proponemos un método para calcular la similitud entre la consulta de lenguaje de origen y la consulta de lenguaje de destino explotando, además de la información de traducción, un amplio espectro de información bilingüe y monolingüe, como co-ocurrencias, registros de consultas condatos de clic, etc. Se utiliza un modelo discriminativo para aprender la similitud de consulta multilingüe basada en un conjunto de consultas traducidas manualmente. El modelo está entrenado optimizando la similitud multilingüe para adaptarse mejor a la similitud monolingüe entre una consulta y la traducción de las otras consultas. Además de ser comparado como un módulo independiente, el sistema CLQS resultante se prueba como un nuevo medio de traducción de consultas en la tarea CLIR en las colecciones TREC. Los resultados muestran que este nuevo método de traducción es más efectivo que el método de traducción de consultas tradicional. El resto de este documento se organiza de la siguiente manera: la Sección 2 introduce el trabajo relacionado;La Sección 3 describe en detalle el modelo discriminativo para estimar la similitud de consulta multilingüe;La Sección 4 presenta un nuevo enfoque CLIR utilizando sugerencia de consulta interlingüística como un puente a través de los límites del lenguaje. La Sección 5 discute los experimentos y puntos de referencia;Finalmente, el documento se concluye en la Sección 6. 2. Trabajo relacionado La mayoría de los enfoques para realizar una traducción de consultas seguido de un IR monolingüe. Por lo general, las consultas se traducen utilizando un diccionario bilingüe [22], un software de traducción automática [9] o un corpus paralelo [20]. A pesar de los diversos tipos de recursos utilizados, las palabras fuera del vocabulario (OOV) y la desambiguación de la traducción son los dos cuellos de botella principales para CLIR [20]. En [7, 27], las traducciones de términos OOV se extraen de la web utilizando un motor de búsqueda. En [17], el conocimiento bilingüe se adquiere en función del análisis de texto de anclaje. Además, las estadísticas de concurrencia de palabras en el idioma de destino se han aprovechado para la desambiguación de la traducción [3, 10, 11, 19].2 http://www.google.com/language_tools, sin embargo, es discutible que la traducción precisa de la consulta no sea necesaria para CLIR. De hecho, en muchos casos, es útil introducir palabras incluso si no son traducciones directas de ninguna palabra de consulta, pero están estrechamente relacionadas con el significado de la consulta. Esta observación ha llevado al desarrollo de técnicas de expansión de consultas interlingües (CLQE) [2, 16, 18].[2] informa la mejora en CLIR por expansión posterior a la transentación.[16] desarrolla un modelo de relevancia interlingüística al aprovechar las estadísticas de coincidencia cruzada en textos paralelos.[18] hace comparación de rendimiento en múltiples técnicas de CLQE, incluida la expansión previa a la traducción y la expansión posterior a la transentación. Sin embargo, falta de un marco unificado para combinar el amplio espectro de recursos y los avances recientes de las técnicas de minería para CLQE. CLQS es diferente de CLQE, ya que su objetivo es sugerir consultas completas que han sido formuladas por los usuarios en otro idioma. A medida que los CLQ explotan los registros de consulta actualizados, se espera que para la mayoría de las consultas de los usuarios, podamos encontrar formulaciones comunes sobre estos temas en el registro de consultas en el idioma de destino. Por lo tanto, los CLQ también juegan un papel en la adaptación de la formulación de la consulta original a las formulaciones comunes de temas similares en el idioma de destino. Los registros de consultas se han utilizado con éxito para la IR monolingüe [8, 12, 15, 26], especialmente en sugerencias de consulta monolingüe [12] y relacionar los términos semánticamente relevantes para la expansión de la consulta [8, 15]. En [1], el registro de consulta de idiomas de destino ha sido explotado para ayudar a la traducción de consultas en CLIR.3. Estimación de la similitud de consulta multilingüe Un motor de búsqueda tiene un registro de consultas que contiene consultas de usuario en diferentes idiomas dentro de un cierto período de tiempo. Además de los términos de consulta, también se registra información de clics. Por lo tanto, sabemos qué documentos han sido seleccionados por los usuarios para cada consulta. Dada una consulta en el lenguaje de origen, nuestra tarea CLQS es determinar una o varias consultas similares en el idioma de destino del registro de consulta. El problema clave con la sugerencia de consulta multilingüe es cómo aprender una medida de similitud entre dos consultas en diferentes idiomas. Aunque se han estudiado varias medidas de similitud estadística para términos monolingües [8, 26], la mayoría de ellas se basan en estadísticas de concurrencia de término, y difícilmente se pueden aplicar directamente en entornos interlingües. Para definir una medida de similitud en todos los idiomas, uno debe usar al menos una herramienta o recurso de traducción. Entonces, la medida se basa tanto en la relación de traducción como en la similitud monolingüe. En este documento, como nuestro propósito es proporcionar una medida de similitud de consulta actualizada, puede no ser suficiente usar solo un recurso de traducción estática. Por lo tanto, también integramos un método para extraer posibles traducciones en la web. Este método es particularmente útil para tratar los términos de OOV. Dado un conjunto de recursos de diferentes naturalezas, la siguiente pregunta es cómo integrarlos de manera principalmente. En este artículo, proponemos un modelo discriminativo para aprender la medida de similitud apropiada. El principio es el siguiente: suponemos que tenemos una medida de similitud de consulta monolingüe razonable. Para cualquier ejemplo de consulta de capacitación para el cual existe una traducción, su medida de similitud (con cualquier otra consulta) se transpone a su traducción. Por lo tanto, tenemos el valor de similitud de idioma cruzado deseado para este ejemplo. Luego usamos un modelo discriminativo para aprender la función de similitud de lenguaje cruzado que se ajusta a los mejores ejemplos. En las siguientes secciones, describamos primero el detalle del modelo discriminativo para la estimación de similitud de consulta interlingüística. Luego presentamos todas las características (información monolingüe y cruzada) que utilizaremos en el modelo discriminativo.3.1 Modelo discriminativo para estimar la similitud de consulta interlingüística En esta sección, proponemos un modelo discriminativo para aprender similitudes de consulta cruzada de manera principalmente. El principio es el siguiente: para una similitud de consulta monolingüe razonable entre dos consultas, se puede deducir un corresponsal interlingual entre una consulta y otra traducción de consultas. En otras palabras, para un par de consultas en diferentes idiomas, su similitud cruzada debería adaptarse a la similitud monolingüe entre una consulta y la traducción de las otras consultas. Por ejemplo, la similitud entre las páginas de consultas francesas Jaunes (es decir, la página amarilla en inglés) y el directorio telefónico de consulta en inglés debe ser igual a la similitud monolingüe entre la traducción de la página amarilla de la consulta francesa y el directorio telefónico. Hay muchas formas de obtener una medida de similitud monolingüe entre los términos, por ejemplo, información mutua basada en la concurrencia de término y 2 χ. Cualquiera de ellos puede usarse como el objetivo para que la función de similitud multilingüe se ajuste. De esta manera, la estimación de similitud de consulta interlingüística se formula como una tarea de regresión de la siguiente manera: dada una consulta de lenguaje de origen FQ, una ecualización de consulta de lenguaje de destino y una similitud de consulta monolingüe MLSIM, el correspondiente similitud de consulta interlingüística CLSIM se define comoSigue :), (), (eqmlefcl qtsimqqsim f = (1) donde fqt es la traducción de fq en el idioma de destino. Según la ecuación (1), sería relativamente fácil crear un corpus de entrenamiento. Todo lo que requiere es una lista de traducciones de consultas. Luego, se puede usar un sistema de sugerencia de consulta monolingüe existente para producir automáticamente una consulta similar a cada traducción, y crear el corpus de capacitación para la estimación de similitud interlingüística. Otra ventaja es que es bastante fácil utilizar fuentes de información arbitraria dentro de un marco de modelado discriminativo para lograr un rendimiento óptimo. En este documento, el algoritmo de regresión de la máquina de vectores de soporte (SVM) [25] se utiliza para aprender la función de similitud de término multilingüe. Dado un vector de funciones de características f entre FQ y Eq,), (EFCL TTSIM se representa como un producto interno entre un vector de peso y el vector de características en un espacio de núcleo de la siguiente manera:)), ((), (Efefcl TTFWTTSIM φ •= (2) donde φ es el mapeo desde el espacio de la característica de entrada en el espacio del núcleo, y el vector de peso en el espacio del núcleo que se aprenderá por el entrenamiento de regresión SVM. Una vez que se aprende el vector de peso, la ecuación (2) puede usarse para estimar la similitud entre consultas de diferentes idiomas. Queremos señalar que en lugar de la regresión, uno definitivamente puede simplificar la tarea como una clasificación binaria u ordinal, en cuyo caso los CLQS se pueden clasificar de acuerdo con las etiquetas de clase discontinuas, por ejemplo, relevantes e irrelevantes, o una serie de niveles de relevantes,por ejemplo, fuertemente relevante, débilmente relevante e irrelevante. En cualquier caso, uno puede recurrir a enfoques de clasificación discriminatoria, como una SVM o un modelo de entropía máxima, de manera directa. Sin embargo, el formalismo de regresión nos permite clasificar completamente las consultas sugeridas basadas en el puntaje de similitud dado por la ecuación (1). Las ecuaciones (1) y (2) construyen un modelo de regresión para la estimación de similitud de consulta interlingüística. En las siguientes secciones, se presentarán la medida de similitud de consulta monolingüe (ver Sección 3.2) y las funciones de características utilizadas para la regresión SVM (ver Sección 3.3).3.2 Medida de similitud de consulta monolingüe basada en información de clics cualquier medida de similitud de término monolingüe puede usarse como objetivo de regresión. En este documento, seleccionamos la medida de similitud de consulta monolingüe presentada en [26] que informa un buen rendimiento mediante el uso de la información de clics de los usuarios de búsqueda en los registros de consultas. La razón para elegir esta similitud monolingüe es que se define en un contexto similar al nuestro, de acuerdo con un registro de usuarios que refleja la intención y el comportamiento de los usuarios. Por lo tanto, podemos esperar que el término de similitud de nivel cruzado aprendido de él también pueda reflejar la intención y la expectativa de los usuarios. Después de [26], nuestra similitud de consulta monolingüe se define combinando tanto la similitud basada en el contenido de consulta como la comunidad en el registro de consultas. Primero, la similitud de contenido entre dos consultas P y Q se define de la siguiente manera:)) (), ((), (), (QKNPKNMAX QPKN QPSIMILITY content = (3) donde) (Xkn es el número de palabras clave en una consulta x,), (QPKN es el número de palabras clave comunes en las dos consultas. En segundo lugar, la similitud basada en el clic se define de la siguiente manera,)) (), ((), (), (QRDPRDMAX QPRD QPSIMILITITY a través de Ciclk =-(4) donde) (XRD es el número de URL de clics para una consulta x,y), (QPRD es el número de URL comunes que se hacen clic para dos consultas. Finalmente, la similitud entre dos consultas es una combinación lineal de las similitudes basadas en el contenido y basadas en clic, y se presenta de la siguiente manera :), (*), (*), (QPSIMILITY QPSIMILIMILARITYQPSIMILITITY a través de Contenido declick — += β α(5) donde α y β son la importancia relativa de las dos medidas de similitud. En este artículo, establecemos, 4.0 = α y 6.0 = β después de la práctica en [26]. Las consultas con una medida de similitud más alta que un umbral con otra consulta se considerarán como sugerencias de consulta monolingüe relevante (MLQ) para este último. En este artículo, el umbral se establece como 0.9 empíricamente.3.3 Características utilizadas para aprender medición de similitud de consulta interlingüística Esta sección presenta la extracción de consultas relevantes candidatas del registro con la ayuda de varios recursos monolingües y bilingües. Mientras tanto, se definen funciones de características sobre la consulta de origen y los candidatos relevantes interlingües. Algunos de los recursos que se utilizan aquí, como el léxico bilingüe y los corpus paralelos, fueron para la traducción de consultas en trabajos anteriores. Pero tenga en cuenta que los empleamos aquí como un asistente significa para encontrar candidatos relevantes en el registro en lugar de adquirir traducciones precisas.3.3.1 Diccionario bilingüe En esta subsección, se utiliza un diccionario bilingüe incorporado en casa que contiene 120,000 entradas únicas para recuperar consultas candidatas. Dado que múltiples traducciones pueden estar asociadas con cada palabra fuente, se realiza la desambiguación de traducción basada en la concurrencia [3, 10]. El proceso se presenta de la siguiente manera: dada una consulta de entrada} {, 2,1 fnfff wwwq k = en el idioma de origen, para cada término de consulta fiw, el diccionario bilingüe dcictionary d:}, {{) proporciona un conjunto de traducciones únicas.(, 2,1 imiifi tttwd k =. Luego, la cohesión entre las traducciones de dos términos de consulta se mide utilizando información mutua que se calcula de la siguiente manera:) () (), (log), () (, klij klij klijklij tptp ttp ttpttmi = (6) donde.) () () () ()(,), (), (N tc tp n ttc ttp klij klij == aquí), (yxc es el número de consultas en el registro que contiene x e y,) (xc es el número de consultas que contienen el término x, yN es el número total de consultas en el registro. Según la cohesión a término definida en la ecuación (6), todas las traducciones de consulta posibles se clasifican utilizando la suma de la cohesión a término ∑ ≠ = kiki klijqdict ttmits f ,,), () (. El conjunto de traducciones de consulta Top-4 se denota como) (FQTS. Para cada posible traducción de consultas) (fqtst∈, recuperamos todas las consultas que contienen las mismas palabras clave que t del registro de idiomas de destino. Las consultas recuperadas son consultas de objetivos candidatos y se asignan) (TSDict como el valor de la puntuación de traducción basada en el diccionario de características. 3.3.2 Los corpus paralelos paralelos son recursos preciosos para la adquisición de conocimiento bilingüe. A diferencia del diccionario bilingüe, el conocimiento bilingüe aprendido de los corpus paralelos asigna probabilidad para cada candidato de traducción que es útil para adquirir traducciones dominantes de consulta. En este artículo, se utiliza el Corpus Europarl (un conjunto de textos paralelos franceses e ingleses de las actas del Parlamento Europeo). El corpus está alineado por primera vez. Luego, las alineaciones de palabras se derivan entrenando un modelo de traducción de IBM 1 [4] usando GIZA ++ [21]. El conocimiento bilingüe aprendido se usa para extraer consultas candidatas del registro de consultas. El proceso se presenta de la siguiente manera: dado un par de consultas, FQ en el lenguaje de origen y la ecualización en el idioma de destino, el puntaje de traducción bidireccional se define de la siguiente manera :) | () | (), (111 FeibMefibMefibm QQPQQPQS = (((7) donde) | (1 xypibm es la probabilidad de traducción de secuencia de palabras dada por IBM Modelo 1 que tiene la siguiente forma: ∏∑ = =+ = || 1 || 0 || 1) | () 1 | (| 1)| (y j x i ijyibm xyp x xyp (8) donde) | (ij xyp es la probabilidad de traducción de palabras a palabras derivada de los corpus alineados por las palabras. La razón para usar la probabilidad de traducción bidireccional es lidiar con el hecho de que las palabras comunes pueden considerarse como posibles traducciones de muchas palabras. Al usar la traducción bidireccional, probamos si las palabras de traducción se pueden traducir de nuevo a las palabras de origen. Esto es útil centrarse en la probabilidad de traducción a los candidatos de traducción más específicos. Ahora, dada una consulta de entrada FQ, las 10 consultas principales} {eq con los puntajes de traducción bidireccionales más altos con FQ se recuperan del registro de consultas, y) (1 efibm QQS en la ecuación (7) se asigna como valor para la característicaPuntuación de traducción bidireccional. 3.3.3 Minería en línea para consultas relacionadas La traducción de palabras OOV es un cuello de botella de conocimiento importante para la traducción de consultas y CLIR. Para superar este cuello de botella de conocimiento, la minería web se ha explotado en [7, 27] para adquirir traducciones de términos en inglés basado en la observación de que los términos chinos pueden concentrarse con sus traducciones al inglés en la misma página web. En esta sección, este enfoque de minería web se adapta para adquirir no solo traducciones sino consultas semánticamente relacionadas en el idioma de destino. Se supone que si una consulta en el lenguaje de destino concursa con la consulta de origen en muchas páginas web, probablemente estén semánticamente relacionadas. Por lo tanto, un método simple es enviar la consulta de origen a un motor de búsqueda (Google en nuestro caso) para páginas web en el idioma de destino para encontrar consultas relacionadas en el idioma de destino. Por ejemplo, al enviar páginas de consulta francesa Jaunes para buscar páginas en inglés, se devolverán los fragmentos en inglés que contienen las palabras clave de las páginas amarillas o el directorio telefónico. Sin embargo, este enfoque simple puede inducir una cantidad significativa de ruido debido a los rendimientos no relevantes del motor de búsqueda. Para mejorar la relevancia de los fragmentos bilingües, ampliamos el enfoque simple mediante la siguiente modificación de la consulta: la consulta original se utiliza para buscar con las traducciones de palabras clave de consulta basadas en el diccionario, que están unificados por ∧ (y) ∨ (o) ∨ (o)) operadores en una sola consulta booleana. Por ejemplo, para una consulta dada abcq = donde el conjunto de entradas de traducción en el diccionario de para a es} ,, {321 aaa, b es}, {21 bb y c es} {1c, emitimos 121321) () () () ()CBBAAAQ ∧∨∧∨∨∧ como una consulta web. Desde los fragmentos Top 700 devueltos, se identifican las 10 consultas objetivo más frecuentes y se asocian con la frecuencia de características en los fragmentos. Además, utilizamos la medida de doble verificación de concurrencia (CODC) para peso la asociación entre las consultas de origen y objetivo. La medida CODC se propone en [6] como una medida de asociación basada en el análisis de fragmentos, llamada Búsqueda web con modelo de doble verificación (WSDC). En el modelo WSDC, se considera que dos objetos A y B tienen una asociación si B se puede encontrar utilizando una consulta AS (proceso hacia adelante), y A se puede encontrar utilizando B como consulta (proceso hacia atrás) mediante búsqueda web.

CLIR Basado en la sugerencia de consulta cruzada en la Sección 3, presentamos un modelo discriminativo para la sugerencia de consulta cruzada cruzada. Sin embargo, la evaluación comparativa de un sistema de sugerencias de consulta no es una tarea trivial. En este documento, proponemos usar CLQ como alternativa a la traducción de consultas y probar su efectividad en las tareas de CLIR. El buen rendimiento resultante de CLIR corresponde a la alta calidad de las consultas sugeridas. Dada una consulta de origen FQ, se recomienda un conjunto de consultas relevantes} {eq en el idioma de destino se recomienda utilizar el sistema de sugerencias de consulta interlingüística. Luego, se llama un sistema IR monolingüe basado en el modelo BM25 [23] usando cada} {eqq∈ como consultas para recuperar documentos. Luego, los documentos recuperados se vuelven a clasificar en función de la suma de las puntuaciones BM25 asociadas con cada recuperación monolingüe.5. Evaluación de rendimiento en esta sección, compararemos el sistema de sugerencias de consulta interlingüística, comparando su rendimiento con sugerencia de consulta monolingüe, estudiar la contribución de varias fuentes de información y probar su efectividad cuando se usa en tareas CLIR.5.1 Los recursos de datos En nuestros experimentos, el francés y el inglés se seleccionan como la fuente y el idioma de destino, respectivamente. Dicha selección se debe al hecho de que los registros de consultas a gran escala están disponibles para estos dos idiomas. Un registro de consultas en inglés de un mes (que contiene 7 millones de consultas de inglés únicas con frecuencia de ocurrencia más de 5) del motor de búsqueda MSN se usa como registro de idiomas de destino. Y se construye un sistema de sugerencia de consulta monolingüe basado en él. Además, 5,000 consultas francesas se seleccionan al azar de un registro de consultas francés (que contiene alrededor de 3 millones de consultas), y son traducidas manualmente al inglés por traductores profesionales de inglés en inglés. Entre las 5,000 consultas francesas, 4,171 consultas tienen sus traducciones en el registro de consultas en inglés y se utilizan para la capacitación y las pruebas de CLQS. Además, entre las 4,171 consultas francesas, el 70% se utilizan para el entrenamiento de similitud de consultas interlingües, el 10% se utilizan como datos de desarrollo para determinar el umbral de relevancia y el 20% se utilizan para las pruebas. Para recuperar las consultas relacionadas con el cruce, se utilizan un léxico bilingüe francés-inglés incorporado (que contiene 120,000 entradas únicas) y el Corpus Europarl. Además de la evaluación comparativa de los CLQ como un sistema independiente, los CLQ también se prueba como un sistema de traducción de consultas para tareas de CLIR. Según la observación de que el rendimiento del CLIR se basa en gran medida en la calidad de las consultas sugeridas, este punto de referencia mide la calidad de los CLQ en términos de su efectividad para ayudar a CLIR. Para realizar dicho punto de referencia, utilizamos los documentos de los datos de TREC6 CLIR (AP88-90 Newswire, 750MB) con 25 pares cortos de consultas francesas de inglés (CL1-CL25). La selección de este conjunto de datos se debe al hecho de que la longitud promedio de las consultas tiene 3.3 palabras de largo, lo que coincide con los registros de consultas web que usamos para entrenar CLQ.5.2 Rendimiento de la sugerencia de consulta interlingüística Se utiliza un error (MSE) medio (MSE) para medir el error de regresión y se define de la siguiente manera: () 2), (), (1 ∑-= i eiqmleificl qtsimqqsim l mse fi dondeL es el número total de pares de consultas interlingües en los datos de prueba. Como se describe en la Sección 3.4, se aprende un umbral de relevancia utilizando los datos de desarrollo, y solo los CLQ con valor de similitud por encima del umbral se considera realmente relevante para la consulta de entrada. De esta manera, los CLQ también se pueden comparar como una tarea de clasificación utilizando Precision (P) y recordar (R) que se definen de la siguiente manera: CLQS MLQSCLQS P SS I =, MLQS MLQSCLQS R S SS I = donde CLQSS es el conjunto de preguntas relevantesSugerido por CLQS, MLQSS es el conjunto de consultas relevantes sugeridas por MLQS (ver Sección 3.2). Los resultados de la evaluación comparativa con varias configuraciones de características se muestran en la Tabla 1. Características de clasificación de regresión MSE P R DD 0.274 0.723 0.098 DD+PC 0.224 0.713 0.125 DD+PC+Web 0.115 0.808 0.192 DD+PC+Web+ML QS 0.174 0.796 0.421 Tabla 1.

El sistema de referencia (DD) utiliza un enfoque de traducción de consultas convencional, es decir, un diccionario bilingüe con desambiguación de traducción basada en la coincurrencia. El sistema de referencia solo cubre menos del 10% de las sugerencias hechas por MLQ. El uso de características adicionales obviamente permite a los CLQ generar consultas más relevantes. La mejora más significativa en el retiro se logra explotando MLQ. El sistema CLQS final puede generar el 42% de las consultas sugeridas por MLQ. Entre todas las combinaciones de características, no hay un cambio significativo en la precisión. Esto indica que nuestros métodos pueden mejorar el retiro aprovechando efectivamente varias fuentes de información sin perder la precisión de las sugerencias. Además de los CLQ de evaluación comparativa comparando su salida con la salida de MLQS, 200 consultas francesas se seleccionan al azar del registro de consulta francés. Estas consultas están dos verificadas para asegurarse de que no estén en el Corpus de entrenamiento de CLQS. Luego, el sistema CLQS se usa para sugerir consultas de inglés relevantes para ellas. En promedio, para cada consulta en francés, se sugieren 8.7 consultas de inglés relevantes. Luego, el total de 1.740 consultas de inglés sugeridas son verificadas manualmente por dos traductores profesionales de inglés/francés con validación cruzada. Entre las 1.747 consultas sugeridas, 1.407 consultas se reconocen como relevantes para las originales, por lo tanto, la precisión es del 80,9%. La Figura 1 muestra un ejemplo de CLQS de la consulta francesa Terrorisme International (terrorismo internacional en inglés).5.3 Rendimiento de CLIR En esta sección, CLQS se prueba con tareas de CLIR de francés a inglés. Realizamos experimentos CLIR utilizando el conjunto de datos TREC 6 CLIR descrito en la Sección 5.1. El CLIR se realiza utilizando un sistema de traducción de consultas seguido de un módulo IR monolingüe basado en BM25 [23]. Los siguientes tres sistemas diferentes se han utilizado para realizar la traducción de consultas: (1) CLQS: nuestro sistema CLQS;(2) MT: el sistema de traducción automática de Google French to English;(3) DT: un sistema de traducción de consultas basado en el diccionario que utiliza estadísticas de coincurrencia para la desambiguación de la traducción. El algoritmo de desambiguación de traducción se presenta en la Sección 3.3.1. Además, el rendimiento monolingüe de IR también se informa como referencia. La precisión promedio de los cuatro sistemas IR se informa en la Tabla 2, y las curvas de recuperación de precisión de 11 puntos se muestran en la Figura 2. Tabla 2. Precisión promedio de CLIR en el conjunto de datos TREC 6 (monolingüe: sistema IR monolingüe; MT: CLIR basado en la traducción automática; DT: CLIR Basado en la traducción del diccionario; CLQS: CLIM basado en CLQS) Sistema IR Promedio de precisión % de monolingüenjera IR monolingüe 0.266 100 % 100 % 100 %MT 0.217 81.6% DT 0.186 69.9% CLQS 0.233 87.6% Figura 1.

La efectividad de los CLQ radica en su capacidad para sugerir consultas estrechamente relacionadas además de traducciones precisas. Por ejemplo, para la consulta CL14 Terrorisme International (terrorismo internacional), aunque la herramienta de traducción automática traduce la consulta correctamente, el sistema CLQS aún alcanza una puntuación más alta al recomendar muchos términos relacionados adicionales como terrorismo global, terrorismo mundial, etc. (como se muestra enFigura 1). Otro ejemplo es la consulta la contaminación de la causa par lautomobile (contaminación del aire debido al automóvil) de CL6. La herramienta MT proporciona a la traducción la contaminación causada por el automóvil, mientras que el sistema CLQS enumera todos los sinónimos posibles del automóvil y sugiere las siguientes consultas, contaminación del automóvil, contaminación automotriz, contaminación del automóvil. Además, también se sugieren otras consultas relacionadas, como el calentamiento global. Para la consulta CL12 LA CULTULE ECOLOGIQUE (agricultura orgánica), la herramienta MT no puede generar la traducción correcta. Aunque la traducción correcta no está en nuestro diccionario francés-inglés, el sistema CLQS genera una granja orgánica como una consulta relevante debido a la exitosa minería web. El experimento anterior demuestra la efectividad del uso de CLQ para sugerir consultas relevantes para la mejora del CLIR. Una investigación relacionada es realizar la expansión de la consulta para mejorar el CLIR [2, 18]. Por lo tanto, es muy interesante comparar el enfoque CLQS con los enfoques de expansión de consultas convencionales. Después de [18], la expansión posterior a la traducción se realiza en función de las técnicas de retroalimentación de pseudorelevancia (PRF). Primero realizamos CLIR de la misma manera que antes. Luego usamos el algoritmo PRF tradicional descrito en [24] para seleccionar términos de expansión. En nuestros experimentos, los 10 términos principales se seleccionan para expandir la consulta original, y la nueva consulta se usa para buscar la colección por segunda vez. El nuevo rendimiento del CLIR en términos de precisión promedio se muestra en la Tabla 3. Las curvas P-R de 11 puntos se dibujan en la Figura 3. Aunque se mejora con la retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia, el CLIR que usa traducción automática o traducción de consultas basada en el diccionario todavía no funciona tan bien como el enfoque basado en CLQS. La prueba t estadística [13] se realiza para indicar si el CLIR basado en CLQS funciona significativamente mejor. Los valores de P por pares se muestran en la Tabla 4. Claramente, los CLQ superan significativamente a MT y DT sin PRF, así como DT+PRF, pero su superioridad sobre MT+PRF no es significativa. Sin embargo, cuando se combina con PRF, los CLQ superan significativamente superan todos los demás métodos. Esto indica la mayor efectividad de los CLQ en la identificación de términos relacionados al aprovechar un amplio espectro de recursos. Además, la expansión posterior a la traducción es capaz de mejorar el CLIR basado en CLQS. Esto se debe al hecho de que los CLQ y la retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia están aprovechando diferentes categorías de recursos, y ambos enfoques pueden ser complementarios.

Conclusiones En este documento, propusimos un nuevo enfoque para la sugerencia de consultas interlingües al minería de consultas relevantes en diferentes idiomas de los registros de consultas. La solución clave a este problema es aprender una medida de similitud de consulta cruzada mediante un modelo discriminativo que explota múltiples recursos monolingües y bilingües. El modelo está entrenado en función del principio de que la similitud interlingüística debería adaptarse mejor a la similitud monolingüe entre una consulta y la traducción de las otras consultas.

Los resultados de la prueba t de importancia pareja. Aquí Pvalue <0.05 se considera estadísticamente significativo que el sistema de CLQS de línea de base aplique un enfoque típico de traducción de consultas, utilizando un diccionario bilingüe con desambiguación de traducción basada en la concurrencia. Este enfoque solo cubre el 10% de las consultas relevantes sugeridas por un sistema MLQS (cuando se proporciona la traducción exacta de la consulta original). Al aprovechar recursos adicionales, como corpus paralelos, minería web y expansión de consulta monolingüe de base logbasada, el sistema final puede cubrir el 42% de las consultas relevantes sugeridas por un sistema MLQS con precisión de hasta el 79.6%. Para probar aún más la calidad de las consultas sugeridas, el sistema CLQS se utiliza como sistema de traducción de consultas en tareas CLIR. Benchmarked utilizando la tarea de CLIR francés a inglés TREC 6, CLQS demuestra una mayor efectividad que los métodos tradicionales de traducción de consultas utilizando herramientas de traducción automática o diccionario bilingüe. La mejora en la tarea de trec francés a inglés con el uso de CLQ demuestra la alta calidad de las consultas sugeridas. Esto también muestra la fuerte correspondencia entre las consultas francesas de entrada y las consultas en inglés en el registro. En el futuro, construiremos el sistema CLQS entre idiomas que pueden estar más libremente correlacionados, por ejemplo, inglés y chino, y estudiaremos el cambio de rendimiento de los CLQ debido a la correspondencia menos fuerte entre las consultas en dichos idiomas.7.

[18] makes performance comparison on multiple CLQE techniques, including pre-translation expansion and post-translation expansion.",

        "The principle is as follows: for a reasonable monolingual query similarity between two queries, a cross-lingual correspondent can be deduced between one query and another querys translation.",
        "In other words, for a pair of queries in different languages, their crosslingual similarity should fit the monolingual similarity between one query and the other querys translation.",
        "For example, the similarity between French query pages jaunes (i.e., yellow page in English) and English query telephone directory should be equal to the monolingual similarity between the translation of the French query yellow page and telephone directory.",
        "There are many ways to obtain a monolingual similarity measure between terms, e.g., term co-occurrence based mutual information and 2 χ .",
        "Any of them can be used as the target for the cross-lingual similarity function to fit.",
        "In this way, cross-lingual query similarity estimation is formulated as a regression task as follows: Given a source language query fq , a target language query eq , and a monolingual query similarity MLsim , the corresponding cross-lingual query similarity CLsim is defined as follows: ),(),( eqMLefCL qTsimqqsim f = (1) where fqT is the translation of fq in the target language.",
        "Based on Equation (1), it would be relatively easy to create a training corpus.",
        "All it requires is a list of query translations.",
        "Then an existing monolingual query suggestion system can be used to automatically produce similar query to each translation, and create the training corpus for cross-lingual similarity estimation.",

        "Once the weight vector is learned, the Equation (2) can be used to estimate the similarity between queries of different languages.",
        "We want to point out that instead of regression, one can definitely simplify the task as a binary or ordinal classification, in which case CLQS can be categorized according to discontinuous class labels, e.g., relevant and irrelevant, or a series of levels of relevancies, e.g., strongly relevant, weakly relevant, and irrelevant.",
        "In either case, one can resort to discriminative classification approaches, such as an SVM or maximum entropy model, in a straightforward way.",

        "Therefore, we can expect that the cross-language term similarity learned from it can also reflect users intention and expectation.",

                "INTRODUCTION Query suggestion is a functionality to help users of a search engine to better specify their information need, by narrowing down or expanding the scope of the search with synonymous queries and relevant queries, or by suggesting related queries that have been frequently used by other users.",
                "Search engines, such as Google, Yahoo!, MSN, Ask Jeeves, all have implemented query suggestion functionality as a valuable addition to their core search method.",

                "Query suggestion is closely related to query expansion which extends the original query with new search terms to narrow the scope of the search.",
                "But different from query expansion, query suggestion aims to suggest full queries that have been formulated by users so that the query integrity and coherence are preserved in the suggested queries.",

                "It has wide applications on World Wide Web: for cross-language search or for suggesting relevant bidding terms in a different language. 1 CLQS can be approached as a query translation problem, i.e., to suggest the queries that are translations of the original query.",
                "Dictionaries, large size of parallel corpora and existing commercial machine translation systems can be used for translation.",
                "However, these kinds of approaches usually rely on static knowledge and data.",
                "It cannot effectively reflect the quickly shifting interests of Web users.",
                "Moreover, there are some problems with translated queries in target language.",
                "For instance, the translated terms can be reasonable translations, but they are not popularly used in the target language.",
                "For example, the French query aliment biologique is translated into biologic food by Google translation tool2 , yet the correct formulation nowadays should be organic food.",
                "Therefore, there exist many mismatch cases between the translated terms and the really used terms in target language.",
                "This mismatch makes the suggested terms in the target language ineffective.",
                "A natural thinking of solving this mismatch is to map the queries in the source language and the queries in the target language, by using the <br>query log</br> of a search engine.",
                "We exploit the fact that the users of search engines in the same period of time have similar interests, and they submit queries on similar topics in different languages.",

                "In this paper, we propose a method of calculating the similarity between source language query and the target language query by exploiting, in addition to the translation information, a wide spectrum of bilingual and monolingual information, such as term co-occurrences, query logs with click-through data, etc.",

                "Despite the various types of resources used, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and translation disambiguation are the two major bottlenecks for CLIR [20].",
                "In [7, 27], OOV term translations are mined from the Web using a search engine.",
                "In [17], bilingual knowledge is acquired based on anchor text analysis.",
                "In addition, word co-occurrence statistics in the target language has been leveraged for translation disambiguation [3, 10, 11, 19]. 2 http://www.google.com/language_tools Nevertheless, it is arguable that accurate query translation may not be necessary for CLIR.",
                "Indeed, in many cases, it is helpful to introduce words even if they are not direct translations of any query word, but are closely related to the meaning of the query.",
                "This observation has led to the development of cross-lingual query expansion (CLQE) techniques [2, 16, 18]. [2] reports the enhancement on CLIR by post-translation expansion. [16] develops a cross-lingual relevancy model by leveraging the crosslingual co-occurrence statistics in parallel texts. [18] makes performance comparison on multiple CLQE techniques, including pre-translation expansion and post-translation expansion.",

                "Given a query in the source language, our CLQS task is to determine one or several similar queries in the target language from the <br>query log</br>.",
                "The key problem with cross-lingual query suggestion is how to learn a similarity measure between two queries in different languages.",
                "Although various statistical similarity measures have been studied for monolingual terms [8, 26], most of them are based on term co-occurrence statistics, and can hardly be applied directly in cross-lingual settings.",
                "In order to define a similarity measure across languages, one has to use at least one translation tool or resource.",
                "So the measure is based on both translation relation and monolingual similarity.",

                "The principle is as follows: for a reasonable monolingual query similarity between two queries, a cross-lingual correspondent can be deduced between one query and another querys translation.",

                "For example, the similarity between French query pages jaunes (i.e., yellow page in English) and English query telephone directory should be equal to the monolingual similarity between the translation of the French query yellow page and telephone directory.",
                "There are many ways to obtain a monolingual similarity measure between terms, e.g., term co-occurrence based mutual information and 2 χ .",
                "Any of them can be used as the target for the cross-lingual similarity function to fit.",
                "In this way, cross-lingual query similarity estimation is formulated as a regression task as follows: Given a source language query fq , a target language query eq , and a monolingual query similarity MLsim , the corresponding cross-lingual query similarity CLsim is defined as follows: ),(),( eqMLefCL qTsimqqsim f = (1) where fqT is the translation of fq in the target language.",
                "Based on Equation (1), it would be relatively easy to create a training corpus.",

                "Then an existing monolingual query suggestion system can be used to automatically produce similar query to each translation, and create the training corpus for cross-lingual similarity estimation.",
                "Another advantage is that it is fairly easy to make use of arbitrary information sources within a discriminative modeling framework to achieve optimal performance.",
                "In this paper, support vector machine (SVM) regression algorithm [25] is used to learn the cross-lingual term similarity function.",

                "In either case, one can resort to discriminative classification approaches, such as an SVM or maximum entropy model, in a straightforward way.",

                "INTRODUCTION Query suggestion is a functionality to help users of a search engine to better specify their information need, by narrowing down or expanding the scope of the search with synonymous queries and relevant queries, or by suggesting related queries that have been frequently used by other users.",
                "Search engines, such as Google, Yahoo!, MSN, Ask Jeeves, all have implemented query suggestion functionality as a valuable addition to their core search method.",

                "Query suggestion is closely related to query expansion which extends the original query with new search terms to narrow the scope of the search.",
                "But different from query expansion, query suggestion aims to suggest full queries that have been formulated by users so that the query integrity and coherence are preserved in the suggested queries.",
                "Typical methods for query suggestion exploit query logs and document collections, by assuming that in the same period of time, many users share the same or similar interests, which can be expressed in different manners [12, 14, 26].",

                "It has wide applications on World Wide Web: for cross-language search or for suggesting relevant bidding terms in a different language. 1 CLQS can be approached as a <br>query translation</br> problem, i.e., to suggest the queries that are translations of the original query.",
                "Dictionaries, large size of parallel corpora and existing commercial machine translation systems can be used for translation.",
                "However, these kinds of approaches usually rely on static knowledge and data.",
                "It cannot effectively reflect the quickly shifting interests of Web users.",
                "Moreover, there are some problems with translated queries in target language.",
                "For instance, the translated terms can be reasonable translations, but they are not popularly used in the target language.",
                "For example, the French query aliment biologique is translated into biologic food by Google translation tool2 , yet the correct formulation nowadays should be organic food.",
                "Therefore, there exist many mismatch cases between the translated terms and the really used terms in target language.",
                "This mismatch makes the suggested terms in the target language ineffective.",
                "A natural thinking of solving this mismatch is to map the queries in the source language and the queries in the target language, by using the query log of a search engine.",
                "We exploit the fact that the users of search engines in the same period of time have similar interests, and they submit queries on similar topics in different languages.",
                "As a result, a query written in a source language likely has an equivalent in a query log in the target language.",
                "In particular, if the user intends to perform CLIR, then original query is even more likely to have its correspondent included in the target language query log.",

                "In this paper, we propose a method of calculating the similarity between source language query and the target language query by exploiting, in addition to the translation information, a wide spectrum of bilingual and monolingual information, such as term co-occurrences, query logs with click-through data, etc.",

                "Despite the various types of resources used, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and translation disambiguation are the two major bottlenecks for CLIR [20].",
                "In [7, 27], OOV term translations are mined from the Web using a search engine.",
                "In [17], bilingual knowledge is acquired based on anchor text analysis.",

                "Indeed, in many cases, it is helpful to introduce words even if they are not direct translations of any query word, but are closely related to the meaning of the query.",
                "This observation has led to the development of cross-lingual query expansion (CLQE) techniques [2, 16, 18]. [2] reports the enhancement on CLIR by post-translation expansion. [16] develops a cross-lingual relevancy model by leveraging the crosslingual co-occurrence statistics in parallel texts. [18] makes performance comparison on multiple CLQE techniques, including pre-translation expansion and post-translation expansion.",

                "CLQS is different from CLQE in that it aims to suggest full queries that have been formulated by users in another language.",
                "As CLQS exploits up-to-date query logs, it is expected that for most user queries, we can find common formulations on these topics in the query log in the target language.",
                "Therefore, CLQS also plays a role of adapting the original query formulation to the common formulations of similar topics in the target language.",
                "Query logs have been successfully used for monolingual IR [8, 12, 15, 26], especially in monolingual query suggestions [12] and relating the semantically relevant terms for query expansion [8, 15].",

                "Although various statistical similarity measures have been studied for monolingual terms [8, 26], most of them are based on term co-occurrence statistics, and can hardly be applied directly in cross-lingual settings.",
                "In order to define a similarity measure across languages, one has to use at least one translation tool or resource.",
                "So the measure is based on both translation relation and monolingual similarity.",
                "In this paper, as our purpose is to provide up-to-date query similarity measure, it may not be sufficient to use only a static translation resource.",

                "For example, the similarity between French query pages jaunes (i.e., yellow page in English) and English query telephone directory should be equal to the monolingual similarity between the translation of the French query yellow page and telephone directory.",
                "There are many ways to obtain a monolingual similarity measure between terms, e.g., term co-occurrence based mutual information and 2 χ .",
                "Any of them can be used as the target for the cross-lingual similarity function to fit.",
                "In this way, cross-lingual query similarity estimation is formulated as a regression task as follows: Given a source language query fq , a target language query eq , and a monolingual query similarity MLsim , the corresponding cross-lingual query similarity CLsim is defined as follows: ),(),( eqMLefCL qTsimqqsim f = (1) where fqT is the translation of fq in the target language.",

                "Another advantage is that it is fairly easy to make use of arbitrary information sources within a discriminative modeling framework to achieve optimal performance.",

                "In this way, cross-lingual query similarity estimation is formulated as a regression task as follows: Given a source language query fq , a target language query eq , and a monolingual query similarity MLsim , the corresponding cross-lingual query similarity CLsim is defined as follows: ),(),( eqMLefCL qTsimqqsim f = (1) where fqT is the translation of fq in the target language.",

                "The model is trained based on the principle that cross-lingual similarity should best fit the monolingual similarity between one query and the other querys translation.",

                "This approach only covers 10% of the relevant queries suggested by an MLQS system (when the exact translation of the original query is given).",
                "By leveraging additional resources such as parallel corpora, web mining and logbased monolingual query expansion, the final system is able to cover 42% of the relevant queries suggested by an MLQS system with precision as high as 79.6%.",
                "To further test the quality of the suggested queries, CLQS system is used as a query translation system in CLIR tasks.",
                "Benchmarked using TREC 6 French to English CLIR task, CLQS demonstrates higher effectiveness than the traditional query translation methods using either bilingual dictionary or commercial machine translation tools.",
                "The improvement on TREC French to English CLIR task by using CLQS demonstrates the high quality of the suggested queries.",
                "This also shows the strong correspondence between the input French queries and English queries in the log.",
                "In the future, we will build CLQS system between languages which may be more loosely correlated, e.g., English and Chinese, and study the CLQS performance change due to the less strong correspondence among queries in such languages. 7.",
