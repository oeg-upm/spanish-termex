J-B Clement, 93430, Villetaneuse ABSTRACT This article deals with the problem of collaborative learning in a multi-agent system. Here each agent can update incrementally its beliefs B (the concept representation) so that it is in a way kept consistent with the whole set of information K (the examples) that he has received from the environment or other agents. We extend this notion of consistency (or soundness) to the whole MAS and discuss how to obtain that, at any moment, a same consistent concept representation is present in each agent. The corresponding protocol is applied to supervised concept learning. The resulting method SMILE (standing for Sound Multiagent Incremental LEarning) is described and experimented here. Surprisingly some difficult boolean formulas are better learned, given the same learning set, by a Multi agent system than by a single agent.

INTRODUCTION This article deals with the problem of collaborative concept learning in a multi-agent system. [6] introduces a characterisation of learning in multi-agent system according to the level of awareness of the agents. At level 1, agents learn ∗The primary author of this paper is a student. in the system without taking into account the presence of other agents, except through the modification brought upon the environment by their action. Level 2 implies direct interaction between the agents as they can exchange messages to improve their learning. Level 3 would require agents to take into account the competencies of other agents, and be able to learn from observation of the other agents behaviour (while considering them as independant entities and not indetermined part of the environment as in level 1). We focus in this paper on level 2, studying direct interaction between agents involved in a learning process. Each agent is assumed to be able to learn incrementally from the data he receives, meaning that each agent can update his belief set B to keep it consistent with the whole set of information K that he has received from the environment or from other agents. In such a case, we will say that he is a-consistent. Here, the belief set B represents hypothetical knowledge that can therefore be revised, whereas the set of information K represents certain knowledge, consisting of non revisable observations and facts. Moreover, we suppose that at least a part Bc of the beliefs of each agent is common to all agents and must stay that way. Therefore, an update of this common set Bc by agent r must provoke an update of Bc for the whole community of agents. It leads us to define what is the mas-consistency of an agent with respect to the community. The update process of the community beliefs when one of its members gets new information can then be defined as the consistency maintenance process ensuring that every agent in the community will stay masconsistent. This mas-consistency maintenance process of an agent getting new information gives him the role of a learner and implies communication with other agents acting as critics. However, agents are not specialised and can in turn be learners or critics, none of them being kept to a specific role. Pieces of information are distributed among the agents, but can be redundant. There is no central memory. The work described here has its origin in a former work concerning learning in an intentional multi-agent system using a BDI formalism [6]. In that work, agents had plans, each of them being associated with a context defining in which conditions it can be triggered. Plans (each of them having its own context) were common to the whole set of agents in the community. Agents had to adapt their plan contexts depending on the failure or success of executed plans, using a learning mechanism and asking other agents for examples (plans successes or failures). However this work lacked a collective learning protocol enabling a real autonomy of the multi-agent system. The study of such a protocol is the object of the present paper. In section 2 we formally define the mas-consistency of an update mechanism for the whole MAS and we propose a generic update mechanism proved to be mas consistent. In section 3 we describe SMILE, an incremental multi agent concept learner applying our mas consistent update mechanism to collaborative concept learning. Section 4 describes various experiments on SMILE and discusses various issues including how the accuracy and the simplicity of the current hypothesis vary when comparing single agent learning and mas learning. In section 5 we briefly present some related works and then conclude in section 6 by discussing further investigations on mas consistent learning. 2. FORMAL MODEL 2.1 Definitions and framework In this section, we present a general formulation of collective incremental learning in a cognitive multi agent system. We represent a MAS as a set of agents r1, ..., rn. Each agent ri has a belief set Bi consisting of all the revisable knowledge he has. Part of these knowledges must be shared with other agents. The part of Bi that is common to all agents is denoted as BC . This common part provokes a dependency between the agents. If an agent ri updates his belief set Bi to Bi, changing in the process BC into BC , all other agents rk must then update their belief set Bk to Bk so that BC ⊆ Bk. Moreover, each agent ri has stored some certain information Ki. We suppose that some consistency property Cons(Bi, Ki) can be verified by the agent itself between its beliefs Bi and its information Ki. As said before, Bi represents knowledge that might be revised whereas Ki represents observed facts, taken as being true, and which can possibly contradict Bi. Definition 1. a-consistency of an agent An agent ri is a-consistent iff Cons(Bi, Ki) is true. Example 1. Agent r1 has a set of plans which are in the common part BC of B1. Each plan P has a triggering context d(P) (which acts as a pre-condition) and a body. Some piece of information k could be plan P, triggered in situation s, has failed in spite of s being an instance of d(P). If this piece of information is added to K1, then agent r1 is not a-consistent anymore: Cons(B1, K1 ∪ k) is false. We also want to define some notion of consistency for the whole MAS depending on the belief and information sets of its constituting elements. We will first define the consistency of an agent ri with respect to its belief set Bi and its own information set Ki together with all information sets K1...Kn from the other agents of the MAS. We will simply do that by considering what would be the a-consistency of the agent if he has the information of all the other agents. We call this notion the mas-consistency: Definition 2. mas-consistency of an agent An agent ri is mas-consistent iff Cons(Bi, Ki ∪ K) is true, where K = ∪j∈{1,..,n}−{i}Kj 1 is the set of all information from other agents of the MAS. 1 We will note this ∪ Kj when the context is similar. Example 2. Using the previous example, suppose that the piece of information k is included in the information K2 of agent r2. As long as the piece of information is not transmitted to r1, and so added to K1 , r1 remains a-consistent. However, r1 is not mas-consistent as k is in the set K of all information of the MAS. The global consistency of the MAS is then simply the mas-consistency of all its agents. Definition 3. Consistency of a MAS A MAS r1,...,rn is consistent iff all its agents ri are masconsistent. We now define the required properties for a revision mechanism M updating an agent ri when it gets a piece of information k. In the following, we will suppose that: • Update is always possible, that is, an agent can always modify its belief set Bi in order to regain its a-consistency. We will say that each agent is locally efficient. • Considering two sets of information Cons(Bi, K1) and Cons(Bi, K2), we also have Cons(Bi, K1 ∪ K2). That is, a-consistency of the agents is additive. • If a piece of information k concerning the common set BC is consistent with an agent, it is consistent with all agents: for all pair of agents (ri,rj) such that Cons(Bi, Ki) and Cons(Bj, Kj) are true, we have, for all piece of information k: Cons(Bi, Ki ∪ k) iff Cons(Bj, Kj ∪ k). In such a case, we will say that the MAS is coherent. This last condition simply means that the common belief set BC is independent of the possible differences between the belief sets Bi of each agent ri. In the simplest case, B1 = ... = Bn = BC . M will also be viewed as an incremental learning mechanism and represented as an application changing Bi in Bi. In the following, we shall note ri(Bi, Ki) for ri when it is useful. Definition 4. a-consistency of a revision An update mechanism M is a-consistent iff for any agent ri and any piece of information k reaching ri, the a-consistency of this agent is preserved. In other words, iff: ri(Bi, Ki) a-consistent ⇒ ri(Bi, Ki) a-consistent, where Bi = M(Bi) and Ki = Ki ∪ k is the set of all information from other agents of the MAS. In the same way, we define the mas-consistency of a revision mechanism as the a-consistency of this mechanism should the agents dispose of all information in the MAS. In the following, we shall note, if needed, ri(Bi, Ki, K) for the agent ri in MAS r1 . . . rn. Definition 5. mas-consistency of a revision An update mechanism Ms is mas-consistent iff for all agent ri and all pieces of information k reaching ri, the masconsistency of this agent is preserved. In other words, if: ri(Bi, Ki, K) mas-consistent ⇒ ri(Bi, Ki, K) mas-consistent, where Bi = Ms(Bi), Ki = Ki ∪ k, and K = ∪Kj is the set of all information from the MAS. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 165 At last, when a mas-consistent mechanism is applied by an agent getting a new piece of information, a desirable sideeffect of the mechanism should be that all others agents remains mas-consistent after any modification of the common part BC , that is, the MAS itself should become consistent again. This property is defined as follows: Definition 6. Strong mas-consistency of a revision An update mechanism Ms is strongly mas-consistent iff - Ms is mas-consistent, and - the application of Ms by an agent preserves the consistency of the MAS. 2.2 A strongly mas-consistent update mechanism The general idea is that, since information is distributed among all the agents of the MAS, there must be some interaction between the learner agent and the other agents in a strongly mas-consistent update mechanism Ms. In order to ensure its mas-consistency, Ms will be constituted of reiterated applications by the learner agent ri of an internal a-consistent mechanism M, followed by some interactions between ri and the other agents, until ri regain its masconsistency. We describe below such a mechanism, first with a description of an interaction, then an iteration, and finally a statement of the termination condition of the mechanism. The mechanism is triggered by an agent ri upon receipt of a piece of information k disrupting the mas-consistency. We shall note M(Bi) the belief set of the learner agent ri after an update, BC the common part modified by ri, and Bj the belief set of another agent rj induced by the modification of its common part BC in BC . An interaction I(ri, rj) between the learner agent ri and another agent rj, acting as critic is constituted of the following steps: • agent ri sends the update BC of the common part of its beliefs. Having applied its update mechanism, ri is a-consistent. • agent rj checks the modification Bj of its beliefs induced by the update BC . If this modification preserve its a-consistency, rj adopts this modification. • agent rj sends either an acceptation of BC or a denial along with one (or more) piece(s) of information k such that Cons(Bj, k ) is false. An iteration of Ms will then be composed of: • the reception by the learner agent ri of a piece of information and the update M(Bi) restoring its aconsistency • a set of interactions I(ri, rj) (in which several critic agents can possibly participate). If at least one piece of information k is transmitted to ri, the addition of k will necessarily make ri a-inconsistent and a new iteration will then occur. This mechanism Ms ends when no agent can provide such a piece of information k . When it is the case, the masconsistency of the learner agent ri is restored. Proposition 1. Let r1,...,rn be a consistent MAS in which agent ri receives a piece of information k breaking its aconsistency, and M an a-consistent internal update mechanism. The update mechanism Ms described above is strongly mas-consistent. Proof. The proof directly derives from the mechanism description. This mechanism ensures that each time an agent receives an event, its mas-consistency will be restored. As the other agents all adopt the final update BC , they are all mas-consistent, and the MAS is consistent. Therefore Ms is a strongly consistent update mechanism. In the mechanism Ms described above, the learner agent is the only one that receives and memorizes information during the mechanism execution. It ensures that Ms terminates. The pieces of information transmitted by other agents and memorized by the learner agent are redundant as they are already present in the MAS, more precisely in the memory of the critic agents that transmitted them. Note that the mechanism Ms proposed here does not explicitly indicate the order nor the scope of the interactions. We will consider in the following that the modification proposal BC is sent sequentially to the different agents (synchronous mechanism). Moreover, the response of a critic agent will only contain one piece of information inconsistent with the proposed modification. We will say that the response of the agent is minimal. This mechanism Ms, being synchronous with minimal response, minimizes the amount of information transmitted by the agents. We will now illustrate it in the case of multi-agent concept learning. 3. SOUNDMULTI-AGENTINCREMENTAL LEARNING 3.1 The learning task We experiment the mechanism proposed above in the case of incremental MAS concept learning. We consider here a hypothesis language in which a hypothesis is a disjunction of terms. Each term is a conjunction of atoms from a set A. An example is represented by a tag + or − and a description 2 composed of a subset of atoms e ⊆ A. A term covers an example if its constituting atoms are included in the example. A hypothesis covers an example if one of its term covers it. This representation will be used below for learning boolean formulae. Negative literals are here represented by additional atoms, like not − a. The boolean formulae f =(a ∧ b) ∨ (b ∧ ¬c) will then be written (a ∧ b) ∨ (b ∧ not − c). A positive example of f, like {not − a, b, not − c}, represents a model for f. 3.2 Incremental learning process The learning process is an update mechanism that, given a current hypothesis H, a memory E = E+ ∪ E− filled with the previously received examples, and a new positive or negative example e, produces a new updated hypothesis. Before this update, the given hypothesis is complete, meaning that it covers all positive examples of E+ , and 2 When no confusion is possible, the word example will be used to refer to the pair (tag, description) as well as the description alone. 166 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) coherent, meaning that it does not cover any negative example of E− . After the update, the new hypothesis must be complete and coherent with the new memory state E ∪ {e}. We describe below our single agent update mechanism, inspired from a previous work on incremental learning[7]. In the following, a hypothesis H for the target formula f is a list of terms h, each of them being a conjunction of atoms. H is coherent if all terms h are coherent, and H is complete if each element of E+ is covered by at least one term h of H. Each term is by construction the lgg (least general generalization) of a subset of positives instances {e1, ..., en}[5], that is the most specific term covering {e1, ..., en}. The lgg operator is defined by considering examples as terms, so we denote as lgg(e) the most specific term that covers e, and as lgg(h, e) the most specific term which is more general than h and that covers e. Restricting the term to lgg is the basis of a lot of Bottom-Up learning algorithms (for instance [5]). In the typology proposed by [9], our update mechanism is an incremental learner with full instance memory: learning is made by successive updates and all examples are stored. The update mechanism depends of the ongoing hypothesis H, the ongoing examples E+ and E− , and the new example e. There are three possible cases: • e is positive and H covers e, or e is negative and H does not cover e. No update is needed, H is already complete and coherent with E ∪ {e}. • e is positive and H does not cover e: e is denoted as a positive counterexample of H. Then we seek to generalize in turn the terms h of H. As soon as a correct generalization h = lgg(h, e) is found, h replaces h in H. If there is a term that is less general that h , it is discarded. If no generalization is correct (meaning here coherent), H ∪ lgg(e) replaces H. • e is negative and H covers e: e is denoted as a negative counterexample of H. Each term h covering e is then discarded from H and replaced by a set of terms {h1, ...., hn} that is, as a whole, coherent with E− ∪ {e} and that covers the examples of E+ uncovered by H − {h}. Terms of the final hypothesis H that are less general than others are discarded from H. We will now describe the case where e = e− is a covered negative example. The following functions are used here: • coveredOnlyBy(h, E+) gives the subset of E+ covered by h and no other term of H. • bestCover(h1, h2) gives h1 if h1 covers more examples from uncoveredPos than h2, otherwise it gives h2. • covered(h) gives the elements of uncoveredPos covered by h. // Specialization of each h covering e− for each h of H covering e− do H = H − {h} uncoveredPos = coveredOnlyBy(h, E+ ) Ar= atoms that are neither in e− nor in h while (uncoveredPos = ∅) do // seeking the best specialization of h hc=h best=⊥ // ⊥ covers no example for each a of Ar do hc= h ∧ a best = bestCover(hc, best) endfor Ar=Ar−{best} hi=lgg(covered(best)) H = H ∪ {hi} uncoveredPos=uncoveredPos - covered(best) endwhile endfor Terms of H that are less general than others are discarded. Note that this mechanism tends to both make a minimal update of the current hypothesis and minimize the number of terms in the hypothesis, in particular by discarding terms less general than other ones after updating a hypothesis. 3.3 Collective learning If H is the current hypothesis, Ei the current example memory of agent ri and E the set of all the examples received by the system, the notation of section 2 becomes Bi = BC = H, Ki = Ei and K = E. Cons(H, Ei) states that H is complete and coherent with Ei. In such a case, ri is a-consistent. The piece of information k received by agent ri is here simply an example e along with its tag. If e is such that the current hypothesis H is not complete or coherent with Ei ∪ {e}, e contradicts H: ri becomes a-inconsistent, and therefore the MAS is not consistent anymore. The update of a hypothesis when a new example arrives is an a- consistent mechanism. Following proposition 1 this mechanism can be used to produce a strong mas-consistent mechanism: upon reception of a new example in the MAS by an agent r, an update is possibly needed and, after a set of interactions between r and the other agents, results in a new hypothesis shared by all the agents and that restores the consistency of the MAS, that is which is complete and coherent with the set ES of all the examples present in the MAS. It is clear that by minimizing the number of hypothesis modifications, this synchronous and minimal mechanism minimize the number of examples received by the learner from other agents, and therefore, the total number of examples stored in the system. 4. EXPERIMENTS In the following, we will learn a boolean formula that is a difficult test for the learning method: the 11-multiplexer (see [4]). It concerns 3 address boolean attributes a0, a1, a2 and 8 data boolean attributes d0, ..., d7. Formulae f11 is satisfied if the number coded by the 3 address attributes is the number of a data attribute whose value is 1. Its formula is the following: f11 = (a0 ∧a1 ∧a2 ∧d7)∨(a0 ∧a1 ∧¬a2 ∧d6)∨(a0 ∧¬a1 ∧ a2 ∧d5)∨(a0 ∧¬a1 ∧¬a2 ∧d4)∨(¬a0 ∧a1 ∧a2 ∧d3)∨(¬a0 ∧ a1 ∧¬a2 ∧d2)∨(¬a0 ∧¬a1 ∧a2 ∧d1)∨(¬a0 ∧¬a1 ∧¬a2 ∧d0). There are 2048 = 211 possible examples, half of whom are positive (meaning they satisfy f11) while the other half is negative. An experiment is typically composed of 50 trials. Each run corresponds to a sequence of 600 examples that are incrementally learned by a Multi Agent System with n agents The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 167 (n-MAS). A number of variables such as accuracy, (i.e. the frequency of correct classification of a set of unseen examples), hypothesis size (i.e. the number of terms in the current formula) or number of stored examples, is recorded each time 25 examples are received by the system during those runs. In the protocol that is used here, a new example is sent to a random agent when the MAS is consistent. The next example will be sent in turn to an other agent when the MAS consistency will have been restored. In such a way we simulate a kind of slow learning: the frequency of example arrivals is slow compared to the time taken by an update. 4.1 Efficiency of MAS concept learning 4.1.1 Execution time We briefly discuss here execution time of learning in the MAS. Note that the whole set of action and interaction in the MAS is simulated on a single processor. Figure 1 shows that time linearly depends on the number of agents. At the end of the most active part of learning (200 examples), a 16MAS has taken 4 times more learning time than a 4-MAS. This execution time represents the whole set of learning and Figure 1: Execution time of a n-MAS (from n = 2 at the bottom to n = 20 on the top). communication activity and hints at the cost of maintaining a consistent learning hypothesis in a MAS composed of autonomous agents. 4.1.2 Redundancy in the MAS memory We study now the distribution of the examples in the MAS memory. Redundancy is written RS = nS/ne, where nS is the total number of examples stored in the MAS, that is the sum of the sizes of agents examples memories Ei, and ne is the total number of examples received from the environment in the MAS. In figure 2, we compare redundancies in 2 to 20 agents MAS. There is a peak, slowly moving from 80 to 100 examples, that represents the number of examples for which the learning is most active. For 20 agents, maximal redundancy is no more than 6, which is far less than the maximal theoretical value of 20. Note that when learning becomes less active, redundancy tends towards its minimal value 1: when there is no more updates, examples are only Figure 2: Redundancy of examples stored in a nMAS (from n = 2 at the bottom to n = 20 on the top) . stored by the agent that receives them. 4.1.3 A n-MAS selects a simpler solution than a single agent The proposed mechanism tends to minimize the number of terms in the selected hypothesis. During learning, the size of the current hypothesis grows up beyond the optimum, and then decreases when the MAS converges. In the Multiplexer 11 testbed, the optimal number of terms is 8, but there also exist equivalent formulas with more terms. It is interesting to note that in this case the 10-MAS converges towards an exact solution closer to the optimal number of terms (here 8) (see Figure 3). After 1450 examples have been presented both 1-MAS and 10-MAS have exactly learned the concept (the respective accuracies are 0.9999 and 1) but the single agent expresses in average the result as a 11.0 terms DNF whereas the 10-MAS expresses it as a 8.8 terms DNF. However for some other boolean functions we found that during learning 1-MAS always produces larger hypotheses than 10-MAS but that both MAS converge to hypotheses with similar size results. 4.1.4 A n-MAS is more accurate than a single agent Figure 4 shows the improvement brought by a MAS with n agents compared to a single agent. This improvement was not especially expected, because whether we have one or n agents, when N examples are given to the MAS it has access to the same amount of information, maintains only on ongoing hypothesis and uses the same basic revision algorithm whenever an agent has to modify the current hypothesis. Note that if the accuracy of 1, 2, 4 and 10-MAS are significantly different, getting better as the number of agents increases, there is no clear difference beyond this point: the accuracy curve of the 100 agents MAS is very close to the one of the 10 agents MAS. 4.1.4.1 Boolean formulas. To evaluate this accuracy improvement, we have experimented our protocol on other problems of boolean function learning, As in the Multiplexer-11 case, these functions 168 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Figure 3: Size of the hypothesis built by 1 and 10MAS: the M11 case. Figure 4: Accuracy of a n-MAS: the M11 case (from bottom to top, n = 1, 2, 4, 10, 100). are learnt in the form of more or less syntactically complex DNF3 (that is with more or less conjunctive terms in the DNF), but are also more or less difficult to learn as it can be difficult to get its way in the hypothesis space to reach them. Furthermore, the presence in the description of irrelevant attributes (that is attributes that does not belong to the target DNF) makes the problem more difficult. The following problems have been selected to experiment our protocol: (i) the multiplexer-11 with 9 irrelevant attributes: M11 9, (ii) the 20-multiplexer M20 (with 4 address bits and 16 data bits), (iii) a difficult parity problem (see [4]) the Xorp m: there must be an odd number of bits with value 1 in the p first attributes for the instance to be positive, the p others bits being irrelevant, and (iv) a simple DNF formula (a ∧ b ∧ c) ∨ (c ∧ d ∧ e)(e ∧ f ∧ g) ∧ (g ∧ h ∧ i) with 19 irrelevant attributes. The following table sums up some information about these problems, giving the total number of attributes including irrelevant ones, the number of irrelevant 3 Disjunctive Normal Forms attributes, the minimal number of terms of the corresponding DNF, and the number of learning examples used.

For the experiments with JRip and Id3, we measured the mean accuracy on 50 trials, each time randomly separating examples in a learning set and a test set. JRip and Id3 parameters are default parameters, except that JRip is used without pruning. The following table shows the results: Pb JRip Id3 Sm 1 Sm 10 M11 88.3 80.7 88.7 95.5 M11 9 73.4 67.9 66.8 83.5 M20 67.7 62.7 64.6 78.2 Xor3 25 54.4 55.2 71.4 98.5 Xor5 5 52.6 60.8 71.1 78.3 Xor5 15 50.9 51.93 62.4 96.1 Simple4-9 19 99.9 92.3 87.89 98.21 It is clear that difficult problems are better solved with more agents (see for instance xor5 15). We think that these benefits, which can be important with an increasing number of agents, are due to the fact that each agent really memorizes only part of the total number of examples, and this part is partly selected by other agents as counter examples, which cause a greater number of current hypothesis updates and therefore, a better exploration of the hypotheses space. 4.1.4.2 ML database problems. We did also experiments with some non boolean problems. We considered only two classes (positive/negative) problems, taken from the UCIs learning problems database[3]. In all these problems, examples are described as a vector of couples (attribute, value). The value domains can be either boolean, numeric (wholly ordered set), or nominal (non-ordered set). An adequate set of atoms A must be constituted for each problem. For instance, if a is a numeric attribute, we define at most k threshold si, giving k+1 intervals of uniform density4 . Therefore, each distinct threshold si gives two atoms a ≤ si and a > si. In our experiments, we took a maximal number of threshold k = 8. For instance, in the iono problem case, there were 34 numeric attributes, and an instance is described with 506 atoms. Below are given the accuracy results of our system along with previous results. The column Nb ex. refer to the 4 The probability for the value of a to be in any interval is constant The Sixth Intl.

In some cases, there is an accuracy improvement with a 10 agents MAS. However, with such benchmarks data, which are often noisy, the difficulty does not really come from the way in which the search space is explored, and therefore the improvement observed is not always significant. The same kind of phenomenon have been observed with methods dedicated to hard boolean problems [4]. 4.2 MAS synchronization Here we consider that n single agents learn without interactions and at a given time start interacting thus forming a MAS. The purpose is to observe how the agents take advantage of collaboration when they start from different states of beliefs and memories. We compare in this section a 1-MAS, a 10-MAS (ref) and a 10-MAS (100sync) whose agents did not communicate during the arrival of the first 100 examples (10 by agents). The three accuracy curves are shown in figure 5. By comparing the single agent curve and the synchronized 10-MAS, we can observe that after the beginning of the synchronization, that is at 125 examples, accuracies are identical. This was expected since as soon as an example e received by the MAS contradicts the current hypothesis of the agent ra receiving it, this agent makes an update and its new hypothesis is proposed to the others agents for criticism. Therefore, this first contradictory example brings the MAS to reach consistency relatively to the whole set of examples present in agents memories. A higher accuracy, corresponding to a 10-MAS is obtained later, from the 175th example. In other words, the benefit of a better exploration of the research space is obtained slightly later in the learning process. Note that this synchronization happens naturally in all situations where agents have, for some reason, a divergence between their hypothesis and the system memory. This includes the fusion of two MAS into a single one or the arrival of new agents in an existing MAS. 4.3 Experiments on asynchronous learning: the effect of a large data stream 5 For ttt and kr-vs-kp, our protocol did not use more than respectively 574 and 958 learning examples, so we put another number in the column. Figure 5: Accuracies of a 1-MAS, a 10-MAS, and a 10-MAS synchronized after 100 examples. In this experiment we relax our slow learning mode: the examples are sent at a given rate to the MAS. The resulting example stream is measured in ms−1 , and represents the number of examples sent to the MAS each ms. Whenever the stream is too large, the MAS cannot reach MAS consistency on reception of an example from the environment before a new example arrives. This means that the update process, started by agent r0 as he received an example, may be unfinished when a new example is received by r0 or another agent r1. As a result, a critic agent may have at instant t to send counterexamples of hypotheses sent by various agents. However as far as the agents, in our setting, memorizes all the examples they receive whenever the stream ends, the MAS necessarily reaches MAS consistency with respect to all the examples received so far. In our experiments, though its learning curve is slowed down during the intense learning phase (corresponding to low accuracy of the current hypotheses), the MAS still reaches a satisfying hypothesis later on as there are less and less counterexamples in the example stream. In Figure 6 we compare the accuracies of two 11-MAS respectively submitted to example streams of different rates when learning the M11 formula. The learning curve of the MAS receiving an example at a 1/33 ms−1 rate is almost not altered (see Figure 4) whereas the 1/16 ms−1 MAS is first severely slowed down before catching up with the first one. 5. RELATED WORKS Since 96 [15], various work have been performed on learning in MAS, but rather few on concept learning. In [11] the MAS performs a form of ensemble learning in which the agents are lazy learners (no explicit representation is maintained) and sell useless examples to other agents. In [10] each agent observes all the examples but only perceive a part of their representation. In mutual online concept learning [14] the agents converge to a unique hypothesis, but each agent produces examples from its own concept representation, thus resulting in a kind of synchronization rather than in pure concept learning. 170 The Sixth Intl.

CONCLUSION We have presented here and experimented a protocol for MAS online concept learning. The main feature of this collaborative learning mechanism is that it maintains a consistency property: though during the learning process each agent only receives and stores, with some limited redundancy, part of the examples received by the MAS, at any moment the current hypothesis is consistent with the whole set of examples. The hypotheses of our experiments do not address the issues of distributed MAS such as faults (for instance messages could be lost or corrupted) or other failures in general (crash, byzantine faults, etc.). Nevertheless, our framework is open, i.e., the agents can leave the system or enter it while the consistency mechanism is preserved. For instance if we introduce a timeout mechanism, even when a critic agent crashes or omits to answer, the consistency with the other critics (within the remaining agents) is entailed. In [1], a similar approach has been applied to MAS abduction problems: the hypotheses to maintain, given an incomplete information, are then facts or statements. Further work concerns first coupling induction and abduction in order to perform collaborative concept learning when examples are only partially observed by each agent, and second, investigating partial memory learning: how learning is preserved whenever one agent or the whole MAS forgets some selected examples. Aknowledgments We are very grateful to Dominique Bouthinon for implementing late modifications in SMILE, so much easing our experiments.

Aquí cada agente puede actualizar incrementalmente sus creencias B (la representación conceptual) para que de alguna manera se mantenga consistente con todo el conjunto de información K (los ejemplos) que ha recibido del entorno u otros agentes.

El protocolo correspondiente se aplica al concepto de aprendizaje supervisado.

Introducción Este artículo se ocupa del problema del aprendizaje de concepto colaborativo en un sistema de múltiples agentes.[6] introduce una caracterización del aprendizaje en el sistema de múltiples agentes de acuerdo con el nivel de conciencia de los agentes. En el nivel 1, los agentes aprenden ∗ El autor principal de este documento es un estudiante.en el sistema sin tener en cuenta la presencia de otros agentes, excepto a través de la modificación presentada en el entorno por su acción. El nivel 2 implica la interacción directa entre los agentes, ya que pueden intercambiar mensajes para mejorar su aprendizaje. El nivel 3 requeriría que los agentes tengan en cuenta las competencias de otros agentes y puedan aprender de la observación del comportamiento de los otros agentes (mientras los consideran como entidades independientes y no una parte del medio ambiente como en el nivel 1). Nos centramos en este documento en el Nivel 2, estudiando la interacción directa entre los agentes involucrados en un proceso de aprendizaje. Se supone que cada agente puede aprender de forma incremental de los datos que recibe, lo que significa que cada agente puede actualizar su conjunto de creencias B para mantenerlo consistente con todo el conjunto de información K que ha recibido del entorno o de otros agentes. En tal caso, diremos que es consistente. Aquí, el conjunto de creencias B representa el conocimiento hipotético que, por lo tanto, se puede revisar, mientras que el conjunto de información K representa cierto conocimiento, que consiste en observaciones y hechos no revisables. Además, suponemos que al menos una parte BC de las creencias de cada agente es común para todos los agentes y debe mantenerse así. Por lo tanto, una actualización de este conjunto común BC por el Agente R debe provocar una actualización de BC para toda la comunidad de agentes. Nos lleva a definir cuál es la consistencia masa de un agente con respecto a la comunidad. El proceso de actualización de las creencias de la comunidad cuando uno de sus miembros obtiene nueva información se puede definir como el proceso de mantenimiento de consistencia que garantiza que cada agente de la comunidad se mantenga masconsistente. Este proceso de mantenimiento de consistencia MAS de un agente que obtiene nueva información le da el papel de un alumno e implica la comunicación con otros agentes que actúan como críticos. Sin embargo, los agentes no son especializados y, a su vez, pueden ser alumnos o críticos, ninguno de ellos se mantiene a un papel específico. Las piezas de información se distribuyen entre los agentes, pero pueden ser redundantes. No hay memoria central. El trabajo descrito aquí tiene su origen en un trabajo anterior sobre el aprendizaje en un sistema intencional de múltiples agentes utilizando un formalismo BDI [6]. En ese trabajo, los agentes tenían planes, cada uno de ellos asociado con un contexto que define en qué condiciones se puede activar. Los planes (cada uno de ellos tenía su propio contexto) eran comunes a todo el conjunto de agentes en la comunidad. Los agentes tuvieron que adaptar los contextos de su plan dependiendo del fracaso o el éxito de los planes ejecutados, utilizando un mecanismo de aprendizaje y solicitando ejemplos a otros agentes (éxitos o fallas de planes). Sin embargo, este trabajo carecía de un protocolo de aprendizaje colectivo que permitía una autonomía real del sistema de múltiples agentes. El estudio de dicho protocolo es el objeto del presente documento. En la Sección 2 definimos formalmente la consistencia MAS de un mecanismo de actualización para todo el MAS y proponemos un mecanismo de actualización genérico demostrado como MAS consistente. En la Sección 3 describimos Smile, un alumno de concepto de agente múltiple incremental que aplica nuestro mecanismo de actualización consistente de MAS al aprendizaje conceptual colaborativo. La Sección 4 describe varios experimentos sobre la sonrisa y discute varios temas, incluida la forma en que la precisión y la simplicidad de la hipótesis actual varían al comparar el aprendizaje de un solo agente y el aprendizaje MAS. En la Sección 5 presentamos brevemente algunos trabajos relacionados y luego concluimos en la Sección 6 discutiendo más investigaciones sobre el aprendizaje consistente de MAS.2. Definiciones y marco del modelo 2.1 formal En esta sección, presentamos una formulación general del aprendizaje incremental colectivo en un sistema cognitivo de agente múltiple. Representamos un MAS como un conjunto de agentes R1, ..., Rn. Cada agente RI tiene un conjunto de creencias que consiste en todo el conocimiento revisable que tiene. Parte de estos conocimientos debe compartirse con otros agentes. La parte de BI que es común a todos los agentes se denota como BC. Esta parte común provoca una dependencia entre los agentes. Si un agente RI actualiza su creencia establece BI a BI, cambiando en el proceso BC en BC, todos los demás agentes RK deben actualizar su creencia establecida BK en BK para que BC ⊆ BK. Además, cada agente RI ha almacenado cierta información KI. Suponemos que el agente mismo puede verificar una propiedad de consistencia (BI, KI) entre sus creencias BI y su información KI. Como se dijo antes, BI representa el conocimiento que podría revisarse, mientras que KI representa hechos observados, tomados como verdaderos, y que posiblemente puede contradecir BI. Definición 1. La consistencia A de un agente Un agente RI es una consistencia de las contras de IFF (BI, KI) es verdadera. Ejemplo 1. El Agente R1 tiene un conjunto de planes que se encuentran en la parte común BC de B1. Cada plan P tiene un contexto desencadenante D (P) (que actúa como una condición previa) y un cuerpo. Alguna información K podría ser el plan P, desencadenada en la situación S, ha fallado a pesar de que S es una instancia de D (P). Si esta información se agrega a K1, entonces el Agente R1 ya no es consistente: contras (B1, K1 ∪ K) es falso. También queremos definir alguna noción de consistencia para todo el MAS dependiendo de los conjuntos de creencias e información de sus elementos constituyentes. Primero definiremos la consistencia de un agente RI con respecto a su conjunto de creencias BI y su propia información establecida KI junto con todos los conjuntos de información K1 ... KN de los otros agentes del MAS. Simplemente lo haremos considerando cuál sería la consistencia A del agente si tiene la información de todos los demás agentes. Llamamos a esta noción la consistencia mas: definición 2. consistencia masa de un agente un agente ri es mas consistente iff contraciones (bi, ki ∪ k) es verdadera, donde k = ∪j∈ {1, .., n} - {i} kj 1 es el conjunto de toda la información de otros agentes del MAS.1 Notaremos esto ∪ KJ cuando el contexto es similar. Ejemplo 2. Usando el ejemplo anterior, suponga que la información K está incluida en la información K2 del Agente R2. Mientras la información no se transmitiera a R1, y por lo tanto se agregó a K1, R1 sigue siendo consistente. Sin embargo, R1 no es consistente con MAS, ya que K está en el conjunto K de toda la información del MAS. La consistencia global del MAS es simplemente la consistencia MAS de todos sus agentes. Definición 3. Consistencia de un mas a mas r1, ..., rn es consistente si todos sus agentes ri son masconsistentes. Ahora definimos las propiedades requeridas para un mecanismo de revisión m actualización de un agente RI cuando obtiene una información k.A continuación, supondremos que: • La actualización siempre es posible, es decir, un agente siempre puede modificar su creencia establecida BI para recuperar su consistencia A. Diremos que cada agente es localmente eficiente.• Teniendo en cuenta dos conjuntos de contras de información (BI, K1) y contras (BI, K2), también tenemos contras (BI, K1 ∪ K2). Es decir, una consistencia de los agentes es aditiva.• Si un pedazo de información k con respecto al conjunto común BC es consistente con un agente, es consistente con todos los agentes: para todos los agentes (RI, RJ) de tal manera que los contras (BI, KI) y los contras (BJ, KJ)son verdaderos, tenemos, para toda la información k: contras (bi, ki ∪ k) iff cons (bj, kj ∪ k). En tal caso, diremos que el MAS es coherente. Esta última condición simplemente significa que el conjunto de creencias común BC es independiente de las posibles diferencias entre los establecidos de creencias BI de cada agente RI. En el caso más simple, b1 = ... = bn = bc. M también se verá como un mecanismo de aprendizaje incremental y se representará como una aplicación que cambia de BI en BI. A continuación, notaremos RI (BI, KI) para RI cuando sea útil. Definición 4. A una consistencia de una revisión Un mecanismo de actualización m es una IFF consistente para cualquier agente RI y cualquier información que llegue a RI, la consistencia A de este agente se conserva. En otras palabras, IFF: Ri (Bi, Ki) Con-Consistente ⇒ Ri (Bi, Ki) A-Consistente, donde Bi = M (Bi) y Ki = Ki ∪ k es el conjunto de toda la información de otros agentes delMas. De la misma manera, definimos la consistencia MAS de un mecanismo de revisión como la consistencia A de este mecanismo si los agentes eliminan toda la información en el MAS. A continuación, observaremos, si es necesario, RI (Bi, Ki, K) para el Agente RI en MAS R1...rn. Definición 5. Consistencia MAS de una revisión Un mecanismo de actualización MS es MAS consistente en IFF para todos los agentes RI y todas las piezas de información que alcanzan RI, se conserva la masconsistencia de este agente. En otras palabras, IF: ri (bi, ki, k) mas consistente ⇒ ri (bi, ki, k) mas consistente, donde bi = ms (bi), ki = ki ∪ k y k = ∪kj is is is isEl conjunto de toda la información del MAS. El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 165 por fin, cuando un agente aplica un mecanismo consistente en MAS que obtiene una nueva información, un efecto secundario deseable del mecanismo debe ser que todos los agentes sigan siendo consistentes mas consistentesDespués de cualquier modificación de la parte común BC, es decir, el MAS en sí debería volverse consistente nuevamente. Esta propiedad se define de la siguiente manera: Definición 6. La sólida consistencia MAS de una revisión Un mecanismo de actualización MS es fuertemente consistente en MAS-MS es consistente con MAS, y-la aplicación de MS por un agente conserva la consistencia del MS.2.2 Un mecanismo de actualización muy consistente con MAS La idea general es que, dado que la información se distribuye entre todos los agentes del MAS, debe haber alguna interacción entre el agente del alumno y los otros agentes en un mecanismo de actualización muy consistente de MAS Sra. Para garantizar su consistencia MAS, la EM estará constituida de aplicaciones reiteradas por el agente del alumno RI de un mecanismo interno consistente M, seguido de algunas interacciones entre RI y los otros agentes, hasta que RI recupere su massistencia. Describimos a continuación dicho mecanismo, primero con una descripción de una interacción, luego una iteración y finalmente una declaración de la condición de terminación del mecanismo. El mecanismo es activado por un agente RI al recibir una información k que interrumpe la consistencia MAS. Notaremos m (bi) el conjunto de creencias del agente del alumno RI después de una actualización, porque la parte común modificada por RI y el conjunto de creencias de otro agente RJ inducido por la modificación de su parte común BC en BC. Una interacción I (RI, RJ) entre el agente del alumno RI y otro agente RJ, que actúa como crítico se constituye de los siguientes pasos: • El agente RI envía la actualización BC de la parte común de sus creencias. Habiendo aplicado su mecanismo de actualización, RI es consistente.• El agente RJ verifica la modificación BJ de sus creencias inducidas por la actualización BC. Si esta modificación preserva su consistencia A, RJ adopta esta modificación.• El agente RJ envía una aceptación de BC o una negación junto con una (o más) pieza (s) de información k de tal manera que los contras (BJ, k) son falsos. Luego, una iteración de la EM se compusirá de: • La recepción del agente del alumno RI de una información y la actualización M (BI) restaurando su aconsistencia • Un conjunto de interacciones I (RI, RJ) (en la que varios agentes críticosPosiblemente pueda participar). Si al menos una información que K se transmite a RI, la adición de K necesariamente hará que Ri sea incrustante y se producirá una nueva iteración. Este mecanismo MS termina cuando ningún agente puede proporcionar dicha información k. Cuando es el caso, se restaura la masconsistencia del agente del alumno RI. Proposición 1. Sea R1, ..., RN un MAS consistente en el que el Agente RI recibe una información que rompa su aconsistencia, y en un mecanismo de actualización interna consistente. El mecanismo de actualización MS descrito anteriormente es fuertemente consistente en mas. Prueba. La prueba deriva directamente de la descripción del mecanismo. Este mecanismo asegura que cada vez que un agente reciba un evento, su consistencia mas se restablezca. Como todos los otros agentes adoptan la actualización final BC, todos son consistentes en MAS, y el MAS es consistente. Por lo tanto, MS es un mecanismo de actualización muy consistente. En el mecanismo que MS describió anteriormente, el agente del alumno es el único que recibe y memoriza información durante la ejecución del mecanismo. Asegura que la MS termine. Las piezas de información transmitidas por otros agentes y memorizadas por el agente del alumno son redundantes ya que ya están presentes en el MAS, más precisamente en la memoria de los agentes críticos que los transmitieron. Tenga en cuenta que el mecanismo MS propuso aquí no indica explícitamente el orden ni el alcance de las interacciones. A continuación, consideraremos que la propuesta de modificación BC se envía secuencialmente a los diferentes agentes (mecanismo sincrónico). Además, la respuesta de un agente crítico solo contendrá una información inconsistente con la modificación propuesta. Diremos que la respuesta del agente es mínima. Este mecanismo MS, siendo sincrónico con una respuesta mínima, minimiza la cantidad de información transmitida por los agentes. Ahora lo ilustraremos en el caso del aprendizaje conceptual de múltiples agentes.3. SoundMulti-Agentincremental Learning 3.1 La tarea de aprendizaje Experimentamos el mecanismo propuesto anteriormente en el caso del aprendizaje de concepto MAS incremental. Consideramos aquí un lenguaje de hipótesis en el que una hipótesis es una disyunción de los términos. Cada término es una conjunción de átomos de un conjunto A. Un ejemplo está representado por una etiqueta + o - y una descripción 2 compuesta de un subconjunto de átomos e ⊆ A. Un término cubre un ejemplo si sus átomos constituyentes se incluyen en el ejemplo. Una hipótesis cubre un ejemplo si uno de su término lo cubre. Esta representación se utilizará a continuación para aprender fórmulas booleanas. Los literales negativos están representados aquí por átomos adicionales, como no - a. Las fórmulas booleanas F = (a ∧ b) ∨ (b ∧ ¬c) se escribirán (a ∧ b) ∨ (b ∧ no - c). Un ejemplo positivo de f, como {no - a, b, no - c}, representa un modelo para f.3.2 Proceso de aprendizaje incremental El proceso de aprendizaje es un mecanismo de actualización que, dada una hipótesis actual H, una memoria E = E+ ∪ E− llena con los ejemplos recibidos anteriormente, y un nuevo ejemplo positivo o negativo E, produce una nueva hipótesis actualizada. Antes de esta actualización, la hipótesis dada está completa, lo que significa que cubre todos los ejemplos positivos de E+, y 2 cuando no es posible confusión, el ejemplo de la palabra se utilizará para referirse al par (etiqueta, descripción), así como la descripción sola.166 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) coherentes, lo que significa que no cubre ningún ejemplo negativo de E-. Después de la actualización, la nueva hipótesis debe ser completa y coherente con el nuevo estado de memoria E ∪ {E}. Describimos a continuación nuestro mecanismo de actualización de agente único, inspirado en un trabajo anterior sobre aprendizaje incremental [7]. A continuación, una hipótesis H para la fórmula F objetivo es una lista de términos H, cada uno de ellos es una conjunción de átomos. H es coherente si todos los términos H son coherentes, y H está completo si cada elemento de E+ está cubierto por al menos un término H de H. Cada término es por construcción el LGG (generalización menos general) de un subconjunto de instancias positivas {E1, ..., en} [5], ese es el término más específico que cubre {e1, ..., en}. El operador LGG se define considerando ejemplos como términos, por lo que denotamos como LGG (e) el término más específico que cubre E, y como LGG (H, E) el término más específico que es más general que H y que cubre e.Restringir el término a LGG es la base de muchos algoritmos de aprendizaje ascendente (por ejemplo [5]). En la tipología propuesta por [9], nuestro mecanismo de actualización es un alumno incremental con memoria de instancia completa: el aprendizaje se realiza mediante actualizaciones sucesivas y se almacenan todos los ejemplos. El mecanismo de actualización depende de la hipótesis en curso H, los ejemplos en curso E+ y E-, y el nuevo ejemplo e.Hay tres casos posibles: • E es positivo y H cubre E, o E es negativo y H no cubre e.No se necesita actualización, H ya es completa y coherente con E ∪ {E}.• E es positivo y H no cubre e: e se denota como un contraejemplo positivo de H. Luego buscamos generalizar a su vez los términos H de H. tan pronto como se encuentra una generalización correcta H = LGG (H, E), H reemplaza H en H. Si hay un término que es menos general de que H, se descarte. Si ninguna generalización es correcta (lo que significa aquí coherente), H ∪ lgg (e) reemplaza a H. • E es negativa y H cubre E: E se denota como un contraejemplo negativo de H. Cada término H cubriendo e luego se descarta de H yreemplazado por un conjunto de términos {h1, ...., hn} es decir, en su conjunto, coherente con e- ∪ {e} y eso cubre los ejemplos de e+ descubierto por h - {h}. Los términos de la hipótesis final h que son menos generales que otros se descartan de H. Ahora describiremos el caso donde E = E− es un ejemplo negativo cubierto. Aquí se usan las siguientes funciones: • BUSTONLYBY (H, E+) da el subconjunto de E+ cubierto por H y ningún otro término de H. • Best Cover (H1, H2) da H1 si H1 cubre más ejemplos de descubridos que H2, de lo contrarioda H2.• cubierto (h) da los elementos de descubrimiento cubierto por h.// Especialización de cada h cubriendo e- para cada h de h de h cubriendo e -do h = h - {h} descubrido = cubierto (h, e+) ar = átomos que no están ni en e - ni en h (descubrido = ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅) do // Buscando la mejor especialización de h hc = h best = ⊥ // ⊥ Cubre ningún ejemplo para cada una de AR DO HC = H ∧ A Best = BestCover (HC, Best) Endfor AR = AR− {Best} Hola= lgg (cubierto (mejor)) h = h ∪ {hi} descubrimiento = descubrimiento de descubrimiento - cubierto (mejor) finalización a medida que los términos de h que son menos generales que otros se descartan. Tenga en cuenta que este mecanismo tiende a hacer una actualización mínima de la hipótesis actual y minimizar el número de términos en la hipótesis, en particular al descartar términos menos generales que otros después de actualizar una hipótesis.3.3 Aprendizaje colectivo Si H es la hipótesis actual, ei la memoria de ejemplo actual del agente ri y e el conjunto de todos los ejemplos recibidos por el sistema, la notación de la sección 2 se convierte en bi = bc = h, ki = ei y k = e. Las contras (H, EI) establecen que H es completa y coherente con EI. En tal caso, RI es consistente. La información K recibida por el Agente RI es simplemente un ejemplo E junto con su etiqueta. Si E es tal que la hipótesis actual H no es completa o coherente con EI ∪ {E}, E contradice h: ri se vuelve incrustante y, por lo tanto, el MAS ya no es consistente. La actualización de una hipótesis cuando llega un nuevo ejemplo es un mecanismo consistente. Siguiendo la Proposición 1 Este mecanismo se puede utilizar para producir un mecanismo fuerte consistente con MAS: al recepción de un nuevo ejemplo en el MAS por un agente R, es posible que se necesite una actualización y, después de un conjunto de interacciones entre R y los otros agentes,Resulta en una nueva hipótesis compartida por todos los agentes y que restaura la consistencia del MAS, que es completa y coherente con los conjuntos de todos los ejemplos presentes en el MAS. Está claro que al minimizar el número de modificaciones de hipótesis, este mecanismo sincrónico y mínimo minimiza el número de ejemplos recibidos por el alumno de otros agentes y, por lo tanto, el número total de ejemplos almacenados en el sistema.4. Experimentos A continuación, aprenderemos una fórmula booleana que es una prueba difícil para el método de aprendizaje: el 11-multiplexor (ver [4]). Se refiere a 3 abordar los atributos booleanos A0, A1, A2 y 8 Atributos booleanos de datos D0, ..., D7. Las fórmulas F11 se satisfacen si el número codificado por los 3 atributos de la dirección es el número de un atributo de datos cuyo valor es 1. Su fórmula es la siguiente: F11 = (A0 ∧A1 ∧A2 ∧D7) ∨ (A0 ∧A1 ∧¬A2 ∧D6) ∨ (A0 ∧¬A1 ∧ A2 ∧D5) ∨ (A0 ∧¬A1 ∧¬A2 ∧D4) ∨ (¬A0 ∧A1 ∧A2 ∧D3) ∨ (¬A0 ∧ A1 ∧¬A2 ∧D2) ∨ (¬A0 ∧¬A1 ∧A2 ∧D1) ∨ (¬A0 ∧¬A1 ∧¬A2 ∧D0). Hay 2048 = 211 posibles ejemplos, la mitad de los cuales son positivos (lo que significa que satisfacen F11) mientras que la otra mitad es negativa. Un experimento generalmente se compone de 50 ensayos. Cada ejecución corresponde a una secuencia de 600 ejemplos que son aprendidos incrementalmente por un sistema de agentes múltiples con agentes n el sexto INTL. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 167 (N-MAS). Se registra una serie de variables como la precisión (es decir, la frecuencia de clasificación correcta de un conjunto de ejemplos invisibles), el tamaño de la hipótesis (es decir, el número de términos en la fórmula actual) o el número de ejemplos almacenados, cada vez que se reciben 25 ejemplos.por el sistema durante esas ejecuciones. En el protocolo que se usa aquí, se envía un nuevo ejemplo a un agente aleatorio cuando el MAS es consistente. El siguiente ejemplo se enviará a su vez a otro agente cuando la consistencia MAS se habrá sido restaurada. De tal manera, simulamos un tipo de aprendizaje lento: la frecuencia de las llegadas de ejemplo es lenta en comparación con el tiempo tomado por una actualización.4.1 Eficiencia del aprendizaje conceptual de MAS 4.1.1 Tiempo de ejecución discutimos brevemente el tiempo de ejecución del aprendizaje en el MAS. Tenga en cuenta que todo el conjunto de acción e interacción en el MAS se simula en un solo procesador. La Figura 1 muestra que el tiempo linealmente depende del número de agentes. Al final de la parte más activa del aprendizaje (200 ejemplos), un 16MAS ha tomado 4 veces más tiempo de aprendizaje que 4-MAS. Este tiempo de ejecución representa todo el conjunto de aprendizaje y Figura 1: tiempo de ejecución de un N-MAS (de n = 2 en la parte inferior a n = 20 en la parte superior).Actividad de comunicación y sugerencias al costo de mantener una hipótesis de aprendizaje consistente en un MAS compuesto de agentes autónomos.4.1.2 Redundancia en la memoria MAS Estudiamos ahora la distribución de los ejemplos en la memoria MAS. La redundancia se escribe rs = ns/ne, donde ns es el número total de ejemplos almacenados en el MAS, es decir, la suma de los tamaños de los agentes ejemplos de recuerdos ei, y ne es el número total de ejemplos recibidos del entorno en el mas. En la Figura 2, comparamos redundancias en 2 a 20 agentes MAS. Hay un pico, que se mueve lentamente de 80 a 100 ejemplos, que representa el número de ejemplos para los cuales el aprendizaje es más activo. Para 20 agentes, la redundancia máxima no es más de 6, que es mucho menor que el valor teórico máximo de 20. Tenga en cuenta que cuando el aprendizaje se vuelve menos activo, la redundancia tiende hacia su valor mínimo 1: cuando no hay más actualizaciones, los ejemplos son solo Figura 2: redundancia de ejemplos almacenados en un NMAS (desde n = 2 en la parte inferior a n = 20 en elarriba) .almacenado por el agente que los recibe.4.1.3 Un N-MAS selecciona una solución más simple que un solo agente, el mecanismo propuesto tiende a minimizar el número de términos en la hipótesis seleccionada. Durante el aprendizaje, el tamaño de la hipótesis actual crece más allá del óptimo y luego disminuye cuando el MAS converge. En el multiplexor 11 Testbed, el número óptimo de términos es 8, pero también existen fórmulas equivalentes con más términos. Es interesante observar que en este caso el 10-mas converge hacia una solución exacta más cercana al número óptimo de términos (aquí 8) (ver Figura 3). Después de que se han presentado 1450 ejemplos, tanto 1-mas como 10-mas han aprendido exactamente el concepto (las precisiones respectivas son 0.9999 y 1) pero el agente único expresa en promedio el resultado como un DNF de 11.0 términos, mientras que el 10-mas expresa comoun términos de 8.8 DNF. Sin embargo, para otras funciones booleanas, encontramos que durante el aprendizaje 1-mas siempre produce hipótesis más grandes que 10-MAS, pero que ambos MAS convergen a hipótesis con resultados de tamaño similares.4.1.4 Un N-MAS es más preciso que un solo agente La Figura 4 muestra la mejora traída por un MAS con agentes N en comparación con un solo agente. Esta mejora no fue especialmente esperada, porque si tenemos uno o n agentes, cuando se otorgan n ejemplos al MAS, tiene acceso a la misma cantidad de información, mantiene solo una hipótesis en curso y utiliza el mismo algoritmo de revisión básica cuando un agente tienepara modificar la hipótesis actual. Tenga en cuenta que si la precisión de 1, 2, 4 y 10 mas es significativamente diferente, mejorando a medida que aumenta el número de agentes, no hay una diferencia clara más allá de este punto: la curva de precisión de los 100 agentes MAS está muy cerca delUno de los 10 agentes MAS.4.1.4.1 Fórmulas booleanas.

Además, la presencia en la descripción de los atributos irrelevantes (es decir, atributos que no pertenecen al DNF objetivo) dificulta el problema. Se han seleccionado los siguientes problemas para experimentar nuestro protocolo: (i) el multiplexor-11 con 9 atributos irrelevantes: M11 9, (ii) el 20-multiplexor M20 (con 4 bits de dirección y 16 bits de datos), (iii) un difícilProblema de paridad (ver [4]) El XORP M: Debe haber un número impar de bits con valor 1 en los primeros atributos de P para que el caso sea positivo, los otros bits son irrelevantes y (iv) una fórmula DNF simple(A ∧ B ∧ C) ∨ (C ∧ D ∧ E) (E ∧ F ∧ G) ∧ (G ∧ H ∧ I) con 19 atributos irrelevantes.

Para los experimentos con JRIP e ID3, medimos la precisión media en 50 ensayos, cada vez que separa al azar ejemplos en un conjunto de aprendizaje y un conjunto de pruebas. Los parámetros JRIP e ID3 son parámetros predeterminados, excepto que JRIP se usa sin podar.

Creemos que estos beneficios, que pueden ser importantes con un número cada vez mayor de agentes, se deben al hecho de que cada agente realmente memoriza solo parte del número total de ejemplos, y esta parte es seleccionada en parte por otros agentes como ejemplos de contra.Causa un mayor número de actualizaciones de hipótesis actuales y, por lo tanto, una mejor exploración del espacio de hipótesis.4.1.4.2 Ml Problemas de la base de datos. También hicimos experimentos con algunos problemas no booleanos. Consideramos solo dos problemas (positivos/negativos), tomados de la base de datos de problemas de aprendizaje de UCIS [3]. En todos estos problemas, los ejemplos se describen como un vector de parejas (atributo, valor). Los dominios de valor pueden ser booleanos, numéricos (conjunto totalmente ordenado) o nominal (conjunto no ordenado). Se debe constituir un conjunto adecuado de átomos A para cada problema. Por ejemplo, si A es un atributo numérico, definimos como máximo K umbral K Si, dando intervalos K+1 de densidad uniforme4. Por lo tanto, cada umbral distinto SI le da a dos átomos a ≤ Si y A> Si. En nuestros experimentos, tomamos un número máximo de umbral K = 8. Por ejemplo, en el caso del problema de IONO, hubo 34 atributos numéricos, y se describe una instancia con 506 átomos.

En algunos casos, hay una mejora de precisión con 10 agentes MAS. Sin embargo, con tales datos de referencia, que a menudo son ruidosos, la dificultad realmente no proviene de la forma en que se explora el espacio de búsqueda y, por lo tanto, la mejora observada no siempre es significativa. Se ha observado el mismo tipo de fenómeno con métodos dedicados a problemas booleanos duros [4].4.2 Sincronización de MAS Aquí consideramos que los n solteros aprenden sin interacciones y en un momento dado comienzan a interactuar así formando un MAS. El propósito es observar cómo los agentes aprovechan la colaboración cuando comienzan con diferentes estados de creencias y recuerdos. Comparamos en esta sección un 1-mas, un 10-mas (ref) y un 10-mas (100sync) cuyos agentes no se comunicaron durante la llegada de los primeros 100 ejemplos (10 por agentes). Las tres curvas de precisión se muestran en la Figura 5. Al comparar la curva de agente único y el 10-MAS sincronizado, podemos observar que después del comienzo de la sincronización, es decir, en 125 ejemplos, las precisiones son idénticas. Esto se esperaba ya que tan pronto como un ejemplo E recibido por el MAS contradice la hipótesis actual del agente RA que lo recibe, este agente realiza una actualización y su nueva hipótesis se propone a los otros agentes por críticas. Por lo tanto, este primer ejemplo contradictorio lleva al MAS a alcanzar la consistencia en relación con todo el conjunto de ejemplos presentes en los recuerdos de los agentes. Más tarde se obtiene una mayor precisión, correspondiente a un 10-MAS, del 175 ° ejemplo. En otras palabras, el beneficio de una mejor exploración del espacio de investigación se obtiene ligeramente más tarde en el proceso de aprendizaje. Tenga en cuenta que esta sincronización ocurre naturalmente en todas las situaciones en las que los agentes tienen, por alguna razón, una divergencia entre su hipótesis y la memoria del sistema. Esto incluye la fusión de dos MAS a una sola o la llegada de nuevos agentes a una MAS existente.4.3 Experimentos sobre el aprendizaje asincrónico: el efecto de una gran secuencia de datos 5 para TTT y KR-VS-KP, nuestro protocolo no usó más que los ejemplos de aprendizaje más respectivamente 574 y 958, por lo que ponemos otro número en la columna. Figura 5: precisiones de un 1-mas, un 10 mas y un 10-mas sincronizado después de 100 ejemplos. En este experimento relajamos nuestro modo de aprendizaje lento: los ejemplos se envían a un ritmo determinado al MAS. La secuencia de ejemplo resultante se mide en MS -1, y representa el número de ejemplos enviados a la MAS cada MS. Cada vez que la corriente es demasiado grande, el MAS no puede alcanzar la consistencia MAS en la recepción de un ejemplo del entorno antes de que llegue un nuevo ejemplo. Esto significa que el proceso de actualización, iniciado por el Agente R0 cuando recibió un ejemplo, puede estar inacabado cuando R0 u otro agente recibe un nuevo ejemplo. Como resultado, un agente crítico puede tener en el instante T para enviar contra yramples de hipótesis enviadas por varios agentes. Sin embargo, en cuanto a los agentes, en nuestro entorno, memoriza todos los ejemplos que reciben cuando termina la corriente, el MAS necesariamente alcanza la consistencia MAS con respecto a todos los ejemplos recibidos hasta ahora. En nuestros experimentos, aunque su curva de aprendizaje se ralentiza durante la fase de aprendizaje intensa (correspondiente a la baja precisión de las hipótesis actuales), el MAS todavía alcanza una hipótesis satisfactoria más adelante, ya que hay menos y menos contraejemplos en la corriente de ejemplo. En la Figura 6 comparamos las precisiones de dos 11-mas respectivamente sometidos a flujos de ejemplo de diferentes tasas al aprender la fórmula M11. La curva de aprendizaje del MAS que recibe un ejemplo a una tasa de 1/33 ms - 1 casi no está alterada (ver Figura 4), mientras que el 1/16 ms - 1 MAS primero se ralentiza severamente antes de ponerse al día con el primero.5. Trabajos relacionados desde 96 [15], se han realizado varios trabajos en el aprendizaje en MAS, pero más bien en el aprendizaje conceptual. En [11], el MAS realiza una forma de aprendizaje conjunto en el que los agentes son estudiantes perezosos (no se mantiene una representación explícita) y vende ejemplos inútiles a otros agentes. En [10] cada agente observa todos los ejemplos pero solo percibe una parte de su representación. En el aprendizaje de concepto en línea mutuo [14], los agentes convergen a una hipótesis única, pero cada agente produce ejemplos de su propia representación conceptual, lo que resulta en un tipo de sincronización en lugar de en el aprendizaje conceptual puro.170 El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Figura 6: precisiones de dos tasas de ejemplo asincrónicas de 11 (1/33MS-1 y 1/16MS-1).6. Conclusión Hemos presentado aquí y experimentado un protocolo para el aprendizaje conceptual en línea MAS. La característica principal de este mecanismo de aprendizaje colaborativo es que mantiene una propiedad de consistencia: aunque durante el proceso de aprendizaje, cada agente solo recibe y tiendas, con cierta redundancia limitada, parte de los ejemplos recibidos por el MAS, en cualquier momento la hipótesis actual es consistentecon todo el conjunto de ejemplos. Las hipótesis de nuestros experimentos no abordan los problemas de MAS distribuidos, como fallas (por ejemplo, los mensajes podrían perderse o dañarse) u otras fallas en general (bloqueo, fallas bizantinas, etc.). Sin embargo, nuestro marco está abierto, es decir, los agentes pueden abandonar el sistema o ingresarlo mientras se preserva el mecanismo de consistencia. Por ejemplo, si presentamos un mecanismo de tiempo de espera, incluso cuando un agente crítico se bloquea u omite responder, se implica la consistencia con los otros críticos (dentro de los agentes restantes). En [1], se ha aplicado un enfoque similar a los problemas de abducción de MAS: las hipótesis para mantener, dada una información incompleta, son entonces hechos o declaraciones. El trabajo adicional se refiere al primer acoplamiento de la inducción y la abducción para realizar el aprendizaje de conceptos colaborativos cuando cada agente solo observa parcialmente los ejemplos, y en segundo lugar, investigando el aprendizaje de memoria parcial: cómo se preserva el aprendizaje cuando un agente o todo el MAS olvida algunos ejemplos seleccionados. Conocimientos de conocimiento Estamos muy agradecidos con Dominique Bouthinon por implementar modificaciones tardías en Smile, tan aliviando nuestros experimentos. Parte de este trabajo se ha realizado durante la visita de los primeros autores al Atelier de Bioinformatique de la Universidad de París VI, Francia.7. Referencias [1] G. Bourgne, N. Maudet y S.

There are three possible cases: • e is positive and H covers e, or e is negative and H does not cover e. No update is needed, H is already complete and coherent with E ∪ {e}. • e is positive and H does not cover e: e is denoted as a positive counterexample of H. Then we seek to generalize in turn the terms h of H. As soon as a correct generalization h = lgg(h, e) is found, h replaces h in H. If there is a term that is less general that h , it is discarded.",

                "For instance if we introduce a timeout mechanism, even when a critic agent crashes or omits to answer, the consistency with the other critics (within the remaining agents) is entailed.",
                "In [1], a similar approach has been applied to MAS abduction problems: the hypotheses to maintain, given an incomplete information, are then facts or statements.",

                "Therefore, this first contradictory example brings the MAS to reach consistency relatively to the whole set of examples present in agents memories.",
                "A higher accuracy, corresponding to a 10-MAS is obtained later, from the 175th example.",
                "In other words, the benefit of a better exploration of the research space is obtained slightly later in the learning process.",
                "Note that this synchronization happens naturally in all situations where agents have, for some reason, a divergence between their hypothesis and the system memory.",
                "This includes the fusion of two MAS into a single one or the arrival of new agents in an existing MAS. 4.3 Experiments on asynchronous learning: the effect of a large data stream 5 For ttt and kr-vs-kp, our protocol did not use more than respectively 574 and 958 learning examples, so we put another number in the column.",
                "Figure 5: Accuracies of a 1-MAS, a 10-MAS, and a 10-MAS synchronized after 100 examples.",
                "In this experiment we relax our slow learning mode: the examples are sent at a given rate to the MAS.",
                "The resulting example stream is measured in ms−1 , and represents the number of examples sent to the MAS each ms.",
                "Whenever the stream is too large, the MAS cannot reach MAS consistency on reception of an example from the environment before a new example arrives.",
                "This means that the update process, started by agent r0 as he received an example, may be unfinished when a new example is received by r0 or another agent r1.",
                "As a result, a critic agent may have at instant t to send counterexamples of hypotheses sent by various agents.",
                "However as far as the agents, in our setting, memorizes all the examples they receive whenever the stream ends, the MAS necessarily reaches MAS consistency with respect to all the examples received so far.",
                "In our experiments, though its learning curve is slowed down during the intense learning phase (corresponding to low accuracy of the current hypotheses), the MAS still reaches a satisfying hypothesis later on as there are less and less counterexamples in the example stream.",
                "In Figure 6 we compare the accuracies of two 11-MAS respectively submitted to example streams of different rates when learning the M11 formula.",
                "The learning curve of the MAS receiving an example at a 1/33 ms−1 rate is almost not altered (see Figure 4) whereas the 1/16 ms−1 MAS is first severely slowed down before catching up with the first one. 5.",
                "RELATED WORKS Since 96 [15], various work have been performed on learning in MAS, but rather few on concept learning.",
                "In [11] the MAS performs a form of ensemble learning in which the agents are lazy learners (no explicit representation is maintained) and sell useless examples to other agents.",
                "In [10] each agent observes all the examples but only perceive a part of their representation.",
                "In mutual online concept learning [14] the agents converge to a unique hypothesis, but each agent produces examples from its own concept representation, thus resulting in a kind of synchronization rather than in pure concept learning. 170 The Sixth Intl.",

                "CONCLUSION We have presented here and experimented a protocol for MAS online concept learning.",
                "The main feature of this collaborative learning mechanism is that it maintains a consistency property: though during the learning process each agent only receives and stores, with some limited redundancy, part of the examples received by the MAS, at any moment the current hypothesis is consistent with the whole set of examples.",
                "The hypotheses of our experiments do not address the issues of distributed MAS such as faults (for instance messages could be lost or corrupted) or other failures in general (crash, byzantine faults, etc.).",
                "Nevertheless, our framework is open, i.e., the agents can leave the system or enter it while the consistency mechanism is preserved.",
                "For instance if we introduce a timeout mechanism, even when a critic agent crashes or omits to answer, the consistency with the other critics (within the remaining agents) is entailed.",
                "In [1], a similar approach has been applied to MAS abduction problems: the hypotheses to maintain, given an incomplete information, are then facts or statements.",
                "Further work concerns first coupling induction and abduction in order to perform collaborative concept learning when examples are only partially observed by each agent, and second, investigating partial memory learning: how learning is preserved whenever one agent or the whole MAS forgets some selected examples.",
