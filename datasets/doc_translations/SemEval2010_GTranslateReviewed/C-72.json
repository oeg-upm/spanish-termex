Such radios must coordinate with each other to build an accurate and consistent map of spectral utilization in their surroundings. We focus on the problem of sharing RF spectrum data among a collection of wireless devices. The inherent requirements of such data and the time-granularity at which it must be collected makes this problem both interesting and technically challenging. We propose GUESS, a novel incremental gossiping approach to coordinated spectral sensing. It (1) reduces protocol overhead by limiting the amount of information exchanged between participating nodes, (2) is resilient to network alterations, due to node movement or node failures, and (3) allows exponentially-fast information convergence. We outline an initial solution incorporating these ideas and also show how our approach reduces network overhead by up to a factor of 2.4 and results in up to 2.7 times faster information convergence than alternative approaches.

INTRODUCTION There has recently been a huge surge in the growth of wireless technology, driven primarily by the availability of unlicensed spectrum. However, this has come at the cost of increased RF interference, which has caused the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States to re-evaluate its strategy on spectrum allocation. Currently, the FCC has licensed RF spectrum to a variety of public and private institutions, termed primary users. New spectrum allocation regimes implemented by the FCC use dynamic spectrum access schemes to either negotiate or opportunistically allocate RF spectrum to unlicensed secondary users Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

The second type of allocation scheme is termed opportunistic spectrum sharing. The FCC has already legislated this access method for the 5 GHz band and is also considering the same for TV broadcast bands [1]. As a result, a new wave of intelligent radios, termed cognitive radios (or software defined radios), is emerging that can dynamically re-tune their radio parameters based on interactions with their surrounding environment. Under the new opportunistic allocation strategy, secondary users are obligated not to interfere with primary users (senders or receivers). This can be done by sensing the environment to detect the presence of primary users. However, local sensing is not always adequate, especially in cases where a secondary user is shadowed from a primary user, as illustrated in Figure 1. Here, coordination between secondary users is the only way for shadowed users to detect the primary. In general, cooperation improves sensing accuracy by an order of magnitude when compared to not cooperating at all [5]. To realize this vision of dynamic spectrum access, two fundamental problems must be solved: (1) Efficient and coordinated spectrum sensing and (2) Distributed spectrum allocation. In this paper, we propose strategies for coordinated spectrum sensing that are low cost, operate on timescales comparable to the agility of the RF environment, and are resilient to network failures and alterations. We defer the problem of spectrum allocation to future work. Spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio networks [4, 17] are broadly classified into three regimes; (1) centralized coordinated techniques, (2) decentralized coordinated techniques, and (3) decentralized uncoordinated techniques. We advocate a decentralized coordinated approach, similar in spirit to OSPF link-state routing used in the Internet. This is more effective than uncoordinated approaches because making decisions based only on local information is fallible (as shown in Figure 1). Moreover, compared to cen12 tralized approaches, decentralized techniques are more scalable, robust, and resistant to network failures and security attacks (e.g. jamming). Coordinating sensory data between cognitive radio devices is technically challenging because accurately assessing spectrum usage requires exchanging potentially large amounts of data with many radios at very short time scales. Data size grows rapidly due to the large number (i.e. thousands) of spectrum bands that must be scanned. This data must also be exchanged between potentially hundreds of neighboring secondary users at short time scales, to account for rapid changes in the RF environment. This paper presents GUESS, a novel approach to coordinated spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks. Our approach is motivated by the following key observations: 1. Low-cost sensors collect approximate data: Most devices have limited sensing resolution because they are low-cost and low duty-cycle devices and thus cannot perform complex RF signal processing (e.g. matched filtering). Many are typically equipped with simple energy detectors that gather only approximate information. 2. Approximate summaries are sufficient for coordination: Approximate statistical summaries of sensed data are sufficient for correlating sensed information between radios, as relative usage information is more important than absolute usage data. Thus, exchanging exact RF information may not be necessary, and more importantly, too costly for the purposes of spectrum sensing. 3. RF spectrum changes incrementally: On most bands, RF spectrum utilization changes infrequently. Moreover, utilization of a specific RF band affects only that band and not the entire spectrum. Therefore, if the usage pattern of a particular band changes substantially, nodes detecting that change can initiate an update protocol to update the information for that band alone, leaving in place information already collected for other bands. This allows rapid detection of change while saving the overhead of exchanging unnecessary information. Based on these observations, GUESS makes the following contributions: 1. A novel approach that applies randomized gossiping algorithms to the problem of coordinated spectrum sensing. These algorithms are well suited to coordinated spectrum sensing due to the unique characteristics of the problem: i.e. radios are power-limited, mobile and have limited bandwidth to support spectrum sensing capabilities. 2. An application of in-network aggregation for dissemination of spectrum summaries. We argue that approximate summaries are adequate for performing accurate radio parameter tuning. 3. An extension of in-network aggregation and randomized gossiping to support incremental maintenance of spectrum summaries. Compared to standard gossiping approaches, incremental techniques can further reduce overhead and protocol execution time by requiring fewer radio resources. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 motivates the need for a low cost and efficient approach to coordinated spectrum sensing. Section 3 discusses related work in the area, while Section 4 provides a background on in-network aggregation and randomized gossiping. Sections 5 and 6 discuss extensions and protocol details of these techniques for coordinated spectrum sensing. Section 7 presents simulation results showcasing the benefits of GUESS, and Section 8 presents a discussion and some directions for future work. 2. MOTIVATION To estimate the scale of the problem, In-stat predicts that the number of WiFi-enabled devices sold annually alone will grow to 430 million by 2009 [2]. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that a typical dense urban environment will contain several thousand cognitive radio devices in range of each other. As a result, distributed spectrum sensing and allocation would become both important and fundamental. Coordinated sensing among secondary radios is essential due to limited device sensing resolution and physical RF effects such as shadowing. Cabric et al. [5] illustrate the gains from cooperation and show an order of magnitude reduction in the probability of interference with the primary user when only a small fraction of secondary users cooperate. However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged. Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination. This implies that both data and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a single radio interface. Therefore, any time spent communicating sensory information takes away from the devices ability to perform its intended function. Thus, any such coordination must incur minimal network overhead. Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely fashion. This is especially true due to mobility, as rapid changes of the RF environment can occur due to device and obstacle movements. Here, fading and multi-path interference heavily impact sensing abilities. Signal level can drop to a deep null with just a λ/4 movement in receiver position (3.7 cm at 2 GHz), where λ is the wavelength [14]. Coordination which does not support rapid dissemination of information will not be able to account for such RF variations. Large Sensory Data: Because cognitive radios can potentially use any part of the RF spectrum, there will be numerous channels that they need to scan. Suppose we wish to compute the average signal energy in each of 100 discretized frequency bands, and each signal can have up to 128 discrete energy levels. Exchanging complete sensory information between nodes would require 700 bits per transmission (for 100 channels, each requiring seven bits of information). Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate network bandwidth. Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation. By applying gossip and FM aggregation, aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to (c·logN time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 0.40 Mbps, since 12 time-steps are needed to propagate the data (with c = 2, for illustrative purpoes1 ). This is explained further in Section 4. Based on these insights, we propose GUESS, a low-overhead approach which uses incremental extensions to FM aggregation and randomized gossiping for efficient coordination within a cognitive radio network. As we show in Section 7, 1 Convergence time is correlated with the connectivity topology of the devices, which in turn depends on the environment. 13 X A A X B B X Figure 2: Using FM aggregation to compute average signal level measured by a group of devices. these incremental extensions can further reduce bandwidth requirements by up to a factor of 2.4 over the standard approaches discussed above. 3. RELATED WORK Research in cognitive radio has increased rapidly [4, 17] over the years, and it is being projected as one of the leading enabling technologies for wireless networks of the future [9]. As mentioned earlier, the FCC has already identified new regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed in the literature to support such sharing [4, 17]. Detecting the presence of a primary user is non-trivial, especially a legacy primary user that is not cognitive radio aware. Secondary users must be able to detect the primary even if they cannot properly decode its signals. This has been shown by Sahai et al. [16] to be extremely difficult even if the modulation scheme is known. Sophisticated and costly hardware, beyond a simple energy detector, is required to improve signal detection accuracy [16]. Moreover, a shadowed secondary user may not even be able to detect signals from the primary. As a result, simple local sensing approaches have not gained much momentum. This has motivated the need for cooperation among cognitive radios [16]. More recently, some researchers have proposed approaches for radio coordination. Liu et al. [11] consider a centralized access point (or base station) architecture in which sensing information is forwarded to APs for spectrum allocation purposes. APs direct mobile clients to collect such sensing information on their behalf. However, due to the need of a fixed AP infrastructure, such a centralized approach is clearly not scalable. In other work, Zhao et al. [17] propose a distributed coordination approach for spectrum sensing and allocation. Cognitive radios organize into clusters and coordination occurs within clusters. The CORVUS [4] architecture proposes a similar clustering method that can use either a centralized or decentralized approach to manage clusters. Although an improvement over purely centralized approaches, these techniques still require a setup phase to generate the clusters, which not only adds additional delay, but also requires many of the secondary users to be static or quasi-static. In contrast, GUESS does not place such restrictions on secondary users, and can even function in highly mobile environments. 4. BACKGROUND This section provides the background for our approach. We present the FM aggregation scheme that we use to generate spectrum summaries and perform in-network aggregation. We also discuss randomized gossiping techniques for disseminating aggregates in a cognitive radio network. 4.1 FM Aggregation Aggregation is the process where nodes in a distributed network combine data received from neighboring nodes with their local value to generate a combined aggregate. This aggregate is then communicated to other nodes in the network and this process repeats until the aggregate at all nodes has converged to the same value, i.e. the global aggregate. Double-counting is a well known problem in this process, where nodes may contribute more than once to the aggregate, causing inaccuracy in the final result. Intuitively, nodes can tag the aggregate value they transmit with information about which nodes have contributed to it. However, this approach is not scalable. Order and Duplicate Insensitive (ODI) techniques have been proposed in the literature [10, 15]. We adopt the ODI approach pioneered by Flajolet and Martin (FM) for the purposes of aggregation. Next we outline the FM approach; for full details, see [7]. Suppose we want to compute the number of nodes in the network, i.e. the COUNT query. To do so, each node performs a coin toss experiment as follows: toss an unbiased coin, stopping after the first head is seen. The node then sets the ith bit in a bit vector (initially filled with zeros), where i is the number of coin tosses it performed. The intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss experiments increases, the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes bit vectors increases. These bit vectors are then exchanged among nodes. When a node receives a bit vector, it updates its local bit vector by bitwise OR-ing it with the received vector (as shown in Figure 2 which computes AVERAGE). At the end of the aggregation process, every node, with high probability, has the same bit vector. The actual value of the count aggregate is then computed using the following formula, AGGF M = 2j−1 /0.77351, where j represents the bit position of the least significant zero in the aggregate bit vector [7]. Although such aggregates are very compact in nature, requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%. More accurate aggregates can be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each node, as explained in [7]. This decreases the error to within O(1/ √ m), where m is the number of such bit vectors. Queries other than count can also be computed using variants of this basic counting algorithm, as discussed in [3] (and shown in Figure 2). Transmitting FM bit vectors between nodes is done using randomized gossiping, discussed next. 4.2 Gossip Protocols Gossip-based protocols operate in discrete time-steps; a time-step is the required amount of time for all transmissions in that time-step to complete. At every time-step, each node having something to send randomly selects one or more neighboring nodes and transmits its data to them. The randomized propagation of information provides fault-tolerance and resilience to network failures and outages. We emphasize that this characteristic of the protocol also allows it to operate without relying on any underlying network structure. Gossip protocols have been shown to provide exponentially fast convergence2 , on the order of O(log N) [10], where N is the number of nodes (or radios). These protocols can therefore easily scale to very dense environments. 2 Convergence refers to the state in which all nodes have the most up-to-date view of the network. 14 Two types of gossip protocols are: • Uniform Gossip: In uniform gossip, at each timestep, each node chooses a random neighbor and sends its data to it. This process repeats for O(log(N)) steps (where N is the number of nodes in the network). Uniform gossip provides exponentially fast convergence, with low network overhead [10]. • Random Walk: In random walk, only a subset of the nodes (termed designated nodes) communicate in a particular time-step. At startup, k nodes are randomly elected as designated nodes. In each time-step, each designated node sends its data to a random neighbor, which becomes designated for the subsequent timestep (much like passing a token). This process repeats until the aggregate has converged in the network. Random walk has been shown to provide similar convergence bounds as uniform gossip in problems of similar context [8, 12]. 5. INCREMENTAL PROTOCOLS 5.1 Incremental FM Aggregates One limitation of FM aggregation is that it does not support updates. Due to the probabilistic nature of FM, once bit vectors have been ORed together, information cannot simply be removed from them as each nodes contribution has not been recorded. We propose the use of delete vectors, an extension of FM to support updates. We maintain a separate aggregate delete vector whose value is subtracted from the original aggregate vectors value to obtain the resulting value as follows. AGGINC = (2a−1 /0.77351) − (2b−1 /0.77351) (1) Here, a and b represent the bit positions of the least significant zero in the original and delete bit vectors respectively. Suppose we wish to compute the average signal level detected in a particular frequency. To compute this, we compute the SUM of all signal level measurements and divide that by the COUNT of the number of measurements. A SUM aggregate is computed similar to COUNT (explained in Section 4.1), except that each node performs s coin toss experiments, where s is the locally measured signal level. Figure 2 illustrates the sequence by which the average signal energy is computed in a particular band using FM aggregation. Now suppose that the measured signal at a node changes from s to s . The vectors are updated as follows. • s > s: We simply perform (s − s) more coin toss experiments and bitwise OR the result with the original bit vector. • s < s: We increase the value of the delete vector by performing (s − s ) coin toss experiments and bitwise OR the result with the current delete vector. Using delete vectors, we can now support updates to the measured signal level. With the original implementation of FM, the aggregate would need to be discarded and a new one recomputed every time an update occurred. Thus, delete vectors provide a low overhead alternative for applications whose data changes incrementally, such as signal level measurements in a coordinated spectrum sensing environment. Next we discuss how these aggregates can be communicated between devices using incremental routing protocols. 5.2 Incremental Routing Protocol We use the following incremental variants of the routing protocols presented in Section 4.2 to support incremental updates to previously computed aggregates. Update Received OR Local Update Occurs Recovered Susceptible Time-stamp Expires Initial State Additional Update Received Infectious Clean Up Figure 3: State diagram each device passes through as updates proceed in the system • Incremental Gossip Protocol (IGP): When an update occurs, the updated node initiates the gossiping procedure. Other nodes only begin gossiping once they receive the update. Therefore, nodes receiving the update become active and continue communicating with their neighbors until the update protocol terminates, after O(log(N)) time steps. • Incremental Random Walk Protocol (IRWP): When an update (or updates) occur in the system, instead of starting random walks at k random nodes in the network, all k random walks are initiated from the updated node(s). The rest of the protocol proceeds in the same fashion as the standard random walk protocol. The allocation of walks to updates is discussed in more detail in [3], where the authors show that the number of walks has an almost negligible impact on network overhead. 6. PROTOCOL DETAILS Using incremental routing protocols to disseminate incremental FM aggregates is a natural fit for the problem of coordinated spectrum sensing. Here we outline the implementation of such techniques for a cognitive radio network. We continue with the example from Section 5.1, where we wish to perform coordination between a group of wireless devices to compute the average signal level in a particular frequency band. Using either incremental random walk or incremental gossip, each device proceeds through three phases, in order to determine the global average signal level for a particular frequency band. Figure 3 shows a state diagram of these phases. Susceptible: Each device starts in the susceptible state and becomes infectious only when its locally measured signal level changes, or if it receives an update message from a neighboring device. If a local change is observed, the device updates either the original or delete bit vector, as described in Section 5.1, and moves into the infectious state. If it receives an update message, it ORs the received original and delete bit vectors with its local bit vectors and moves into the infectious state. Note, because signal level measurements may change sporadically over time, a smoothing function, such as an exponentially weighted moving average, should be applied to these measurements. Infectious: Once a device is infectious it continues to send its up-to-date bit vectors, using either incremental random walk or incremental gossip, to neighboring nodes. Due to FMs order and duplicate insensitive (ODI) properties, simultaneously occurring updates are handled seamlessly by the protocol. Update messages contain a time stamp indicating when the update was generated, and each device maintains a lo15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1 10 100 Number of Measured Signal Changes Executiontime(ms) Incremental Gossip Uniform Gossip (a) Incremental Gossip and Uniform Gossip on Clique 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1 10 100 Number of Measured Signal Changes ExecutionTime(ms).

Using this information, a device moves into the recovered state once enough time has passed for the most recent update to have converged. As discussed in Section 4.2, this happens after O(log(N)) time steps. Recovered: A recovered device ceases to propagate any update information. At this point, it performs clean-up and prepares for the next infection by entering the susceptible state. Once all devices have entered the recovered state, the system will have converged, and with high probability, all devices will have the up-to-date average signal level. Due to the cumulative nature of FM, even if all devices have not converged, the next update will include all previous updates. Nevertheless, the probability that gossip fails to converge is small, and has been shown to be O(1/N) [10]. For coordinated spectrum sensing, non-incremental routing protocols can be implemented in a similar fashion. Random walk would operate by having devices periodically drop the aggregate and re-run the protocol. Each device would perform a coin toss (biased on the number of walks) to determine whether or not it is a designated node. This is different from the protocol discussed above where only updated nodes initiate random walks. Similar techniques can be used to implement standard gossip. 7. EVALUATION We now provide a preliminary evaluation of GUESS in simulation. A more detailed evaluation of this approach can be found in [3]. Here we focus on how incremental extensions to gossip protocols can lead to further improvements over standard gossiping techniques, for the problem of coordinated spectrum sensing. Simulation Setup: We implemented a custom simulator in C++. We study the improvements of our incremental gossip protocols over standard gossiping in two dimensions: execution time and network overhead. We use two topologies to represent device connectivity: a clique, to eliminate the effects of the underlying topology on protocol performance, and a BRITE-generated [13] power-law random graph (PLRG), to illustrate how our results extend to more realistic scenarios. We simulate a large deployment of 1,000 devices to analyze protocol scalability. In our simulations, we compute the average signal level in a particular band by disseminating FM bit vectors. In each run of the simulation, we induce a change in the measured signal at one or more devices. A run ends when the new average signal level has converged in the network. For each data point, we ran 100 simulations and 95% confidence intervals (error bars) are shown. Simulation Parameters: Each transmission involves sending 70 bits of information to a neighboring node. To compute the AVERAGE aggregate, four bit vectors need to be transmitted: the original SUM vector, the SUM delete vector, the original COUNT vector, and the COUNT delete vector. Non-incremental protocols do not transmit the delete vectors. Each transmission also includes a time stamp of when the update was generated. We assume nodes communicate on a common control channel at 2 Mbps. Therefore, one time-step of protocol execution corresponds to the time required for 1,000 nodes to sequentially send 70 bits at 2 Mbps. Sequential use of the control channel is a worst case for our protocols; in practice, multiple control channels could be used in parallel to reduce execution time. We also assume nodes are loosely time synchronized, the implications of which are discussed further in [3]. Finally, in order to isolate the effect of protocol operation on performance, we do not model the complexities of the wireless channel in our simulations. Incremental Protocols Reduce Execution Time: Figure 4(a) compares the performance of incremental gossip (IGP) with uniform gossip on a clique topology. We observe that both protocols have almost identical execution times. This is expected as IGP operates in a similar fashion to 16 uniform gossip, taking O(log(N)) time-steps to converge. Figure 4(b) compares the execution times of incremental random walk (IRWP) and standard random walk on a clique. IRWP reduces execution time by a factor of 2.7 for a small number of measured signal changes. Although random walk and IRWP both use k random walks (in our simulations k = number of nodes), IRWP initiates walks only from updated nodes (as explained in Section 5.2), resulting in faster information convergence. These improvements carry over to a PLRG topology as well (as shown in Figure 4(c)), where IRWP is 1.33 times faster than random walk. Incremental Protocols Reduce Network Overhead: Figure 5(a) shows the ratio of data transmitted using uniform gossip relative to incremental gossip on a clique. For a small number of signal changes, incremental gossip incurs 2.4 times less overhead than uniform gossip. This is because in the early steps of protocol execution, only devices which detect signal changes communicate. As more signal changes are introduced into the system, gossip and incremental gossip incur approximately the same overhead. Similarly, incremental random walk (IRWP) incurs much less overhead than standard random walk. Figure 5(b) shows a 2.7 fold reduction in overhead for small numbers of signal changes on a clique. Although each protocol uses the same number of random walks, IRWP uses fewer network resources than random walk because it takes less time to converge. This improvement also holds true on more complex PLRG topologies (as shown in Figure 5(c)), where we observe a 33% reduction in network overhead. From these results it is clear that incremental techniques yield significant improvements over standard approaches to gossip, even on complex topologies. Because spectrum utilization is characterized by incremental changes to usage, incremental protocols are ideally suited to solve this problem in an efficient and cost effective manner. 8. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK We have only just scratched the surface in addressing the problem of coordinated spectrum sensing using incremental gossiping. Next, we outline some open areas of research. Spatial Decay: Devices performing coordinated sensing are primarily interested in the spectrum usage of their local neighborhood. Therefore, we recommend the use of spatially decaying aggregates [6], which limits the impact of an update on more distant nodes. Spatially decaying aggregates work by successively reducing (by means of a decay function) the value of the update as it propagates further from its origin. One challenge with this approach is that propagation distance cannot be determined ahead of time and more importantly, exhibits spatio-temporal variations. Therefore, finding the optimal decay function is non-trivial, and an interesting subject of future work. Significance Threshold: RF spectrum bands continually experience small-scale changes which may not necessarily be significant. Deciding if a change is significant can be done using a significance threshold β, below which any observed change is not propagated by the node. Choosing an appropriate operating value for β is application dependent, and explored further in [3]. Weighted Readings: Although we argued that most devices will likely be equipped with low-cost sensing equipment, there may be situations where there are some special infrastructure nodes that have better sensing abilities than others. Weighting their measurements more heavily could be used to maintain a higher degree of accuracy. Determining how to assign such weights is an open area of research. Implementation Specifics: Finally, implementing gossip for coordinated spectrum sensing is also open. If implemented at the MAC layer, it may be feasible to piggy-back gossip messages over existing management frames (e.g. networking advertisement messages). As well, we also require the use of a control channel to disseminate sensing information. There are a variety of alternatives for implementing such a channel, some of which are outlined in [4]. The trade-offs of different approaches to implementing GUESS is a subject of future work. 9. CONCLUSION Spectrum sensing is a key requirement for dynamic spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks. The nature of the RF environment necessitates coordination between cognitive radio devices. We propose GUESS, an approximate yet low overhead approach to perform efficient coordination between cognitive radios. The fundamental contributions of GUESS are: (1) an FM aggregation scheme for efficient innetwork aggregation, (2) a randomized gossiping approach which provides exponentially fast convergence and robustness to network alterations, and (3) incremental variations of FM and gossip which we show can reduce the communication time by up to a factor of 2.7 and reduce network overhead by up to a factor of 2.4. Our preliminary simulation results showcase the benefits of this approach and we also outline a set of open problems that make this a new and exciting area of research. 10.

Cheriton School of Computer Science keshav@uwaterloo.ca Resumen Las radios inalámbricas del futuro probablemente serán agiles, es decir, que respalda el uso oportunista y adaptativo del espectro de RF. Dichas radios deben coordinarse entre sí para construir un mapa preciso y consistente de utilización espectral en su entorno. Nos centramos en el problema de compartir datos de espectro de RF entre una colección de dispositivos inalámbricos. Los requisitos inherentes de dichos datos y la granularidad del tiempo en la que debe recopilarse hace que este problema sea interesante y técnicamente desafiante. Proponemos Guess, un nuevo enfoque de chismes incrementales para la detección espectral coordinada. (1) reduce la sobrecarga del protocolo al limitar la cantidad de información intercambiada entre los nodos participantes, (2) es resistente a las alteraciones de la red, debido al movimiento del nodo o las fallas en el nodo, y (3) permite una convergencia de información exponencialmente rápida. Esbozamos una solución inicial que incorpora estas ideas y también mostramos cómo nuestro enfoque reduce la sobrecarga de la red hasta un factor de 2.4 y da como resultado una convergencia de información hasta 2.7 veces más rápida que los enfoques alternativos.

Introducción recientemente ha habido un gran aumento en el crecimiento de la tecnología inalámbrica, impulsada principalmente por la disponibilidad del espectro sin licencia. Sin embargo, esto ha tenido el costo de un aumento de la interferencia de RF, lo que ha causado que la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (FCC) en los Estados Unidos reevalúe su estrategia sobre la asignación del espectro. Actualmente, la FCC tiene un espectro de RF con licencia a una variedad de instituciones públicas y privadas, denominadas usuarios principales. Nuevos regímenes de asignación de espectro implementados por la FCC utilizan esquemas de acceso dinámico de espectro para negociar u asignar un espectro de RF de manera oportunista al permiso de usuarios secundarios sin licencia para hacer copias digitales o impresas de todo o parte de este trabajo para uso personal o en el aula se otorga sin tarifa siempre que se otorgue una tarifa que se otorgue una tarifa.Las copias no se hacen o se distribuyen con fines de lucro o ventaja comercial y esas copias llevan este aviso y la cita completa en la primera página.

El segundo tipo de esquema de asignación se denomina intercambio de espectro oportunista. La FCC ya ha legislado este método de acceso para la banda de 5 GHz y también está considerando lo mismo para las bandas de transmisión de TV [1]. Como resultado, está surgiendo una nueva ola de radios inteligentes, denominadas radios cognitivos (o radios definidos por software) que pueden volver a ajustar dinámicamente sus parámetros de radio basados en interacciones con su entorno circundante. Según la nueva estrategia de asignación oportunista, los usuarios secundarios están obligados a no interferir con los usuarios primarios (remitentes o receptores). Esto se puede hacer detectando el entorno para detectar la presencia de usuarios primarios. Sin embargo, la detección local no siempre es adecuada, especialmente en los casos en que un usuario secundario se sombrea de un usuario primario, como se ilustra en la Figura 1. Aquí, la coordinación entre usuarios secundarios es la única forma en que los usuarios sombreados detectan lo primario. En general, la cooperación mejora la precisión de detección por un orden de magnitud en comparación con no cooperar en absoluto [5]. Para realizar esta visión del acceso dinámico del espectro, se deben resolver dos problemas fundamentales: (1) detección de espectro eficiente y coordinada y (2) asignación de espectro distribuido. En este documento, proponemos estrategias para la detección de espectro coordinada que son de bajo costo, operan en escalas de tiempo comparables a la agilidad del entorno RF y son resistentes a las fallas y alteraciones de la red. Aplazamos el problema de la asignación del espectro al trabajo futuro. Las técnicas de detección de espectro para redes de radio cognitivas [4, 17] se clasifican ampliamente en tres regímenes;(1) Técnicas coordinadas centralizadas, (2) técnicas coordinadas descentralizadas y (3) técnicas descoordinadas descentralizadas. Abogamos por un enfoque coordinado descentralizado, similar en espíritu al enrutamiento de estado de enlace OSPF utilizado en Internet. Esto es más efectivo que los enfoques descoordinados porque tomar decisiones basadas solo en la información local es falible (como se muestra en la Figura 1). Además, en comparación con los enfoques tralizados CEN12, las técnicas descentralizadas son más escalables, robustas y resistentes a las fallas de la red y los ataques de seguridad (por ejemplo, Jamming). La coordinación de los datos sensoriales entre los dispositivos de radio cognitivos es técnicamente desafiante porque evaluar con precisión el uso del espectro requiere un intercambio de datos potencialmente grandes con muchas radios en escalas de tiempo muy cortas. El tamaño de los datos crece rápidamente debido al gran número (es decir, miles) de bandas de espectro que deben escanear. Estos datos también deben intercambiarse entre potencialmente cientos de usuarios secundarios vecinos en escalas de tiempo cortas, para tener en cuenta los cambios rápidos en el entorno de RF. Este artículo presenta Guess, un enfoque novedoso para la detección de espectro coordinado para las redes de radio cognitivas. Nuestro enfoque está motivado por las siguientes observaciones clave: 1. Los sensores de bajo costo recopilan datos aproximados: la mayoría de los dispositivos tienen una resolución de detección limitada porque son dispositivos de bajo costo y de ciclo de trabajo de bajo y, por lo tanto, no pueden realizar un procesamiento de señal de RF complejo (por ejemplo, filtrado coincidente). Muchos generalmente están equipados con detectores de energía simples que recopilan solo información aproximada.2. Los resúmenes aproximados son suficientes para la coordinación: los resúmenes estadísticos aproximados de los datos detectados son suficientes para correlacionar la información detectada entre las radios, ya que la información de uso relativo es más importante que los datos de uso absoluto. Por lo tanto, el intercambio de información exacta de RF puede no ser necesaria y, lo que es más importante, demasiado costoso para el fin de la detección del espectro.3. El espectro de RF cambia de forma incremental: en la mayoría de las bandas, la utilización del espectro de RF cambia con poca frecuencia. Además, la utilización de una banda de RF específica afecta solo a esa banda y no a todo el espectro. Por lo tanto, si el patrón de uso de una banda particular cambia sustancialmente, los nodos que detectan ese cambio pueden iniciar un protocolo de actualización para actualizar la información solo para esa banda, dejando la información ya recopilada para otras bandas. Esto permite una rápida detección de cambios mientras se guarda la sobrecarga de intercambiar información innecesaria. Según estas observaciones, Guess hace las siguientes contribuciones: 1. Un enfoque novedoso que aplica algoritmos de chismes aleatorios al problema de la detección de espectro coordinado. Estos algoritmos son adecuados para la detección de espectro coordinado debido a las características únicas del problema: es decir, las radios son limitadas de potencia, móviles y tienen un ancho de banda limitado para admitir las capacidades de detección del espectro.2. Una aplicación de la agregación en la red para la difusión de resúmenes de espectro. Argumentamos que los resúmenes aproximados son adecuados para realizar un ajuste preciso de los parámetros de radio.3. Una extensión de la agregación en la red y el chismoso aleatorizado para apoyar el mantenimiento incremental de los resúmenes del espectro. En comparación con los enfoques de chismes estándar, las técnicas incrementales pueden reducir aún más el tiempo de ejecución de gastos generales y de protocolo al requerir menos recursos de radio. El resto del documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La Sección 2 motiva la necesidad de un enfoque eficiente y de bajo costo para la detección de espectro coordinado. La Sección 3 discute el trabajo relacionado en el área, mientras que la Sección 4 proporciona antecedentes sobre la agregación en la red y los chismes aleatorios. Las secciones 5 y 6 discuten extensiones y detalles del protocolo de estas técnicas para la detección de espectro coordinado. La Sección 7 presenta resultados de simulación que muestran los beneficios de Guess, y la Sección 8 presenta una discusión y algunas direcciones para el trabajo futuro.2. La motivación para estimar la escala del problema, IN-STAT predice que el número de dispositivos habilitados para WiFi vendidos anualmente crecerá a 430 millones para 2009 [2]. Por lo tanto, sería razonable suponer que un entorno urbano denso típico contendrá varios miles de dispositivos de radio cognitivos entre sí. Como resultado, la detección y asignación del espectro distribuido se volvería importante y fundamental. La detección coordinada entre las radios secundarias es esencial debido a la resolución limitada de detección del dispositivo y los efectos físicos de RF, como el sombreado. Cabric et al.[5] ilustran las ganancias de la cooperación y muestran una reducción de orden de magnitud en la probabilidad de interferencia con el usuario primario cuando solo una pequeña fracción de usuarios secundarios coopere. Sin embargo, dicha coordinación no es trivial debido a: (1) el ancho de banda limitado disponible para la coordinación, (2) la necesidad de comunicar esta información sobre escalas de tiempo cortas y (3) la gran cantidad de datos sensoriales que deben intercambiarse. Ancho de banda limitado: debido a las restricciones de costo y energía, la mayoría de los dispositivos probablemente no tendrán hardware dedicado para la coordinación de soporte. Esto implica que tanto los datos como el tráfico sensorial deberán ser multiplexados por tiempo en una sola interfaz de radio. Por lo tanto, cualquier tiempo dedicado a comunicar información sensorial le quita la capacidad de los dispositivos para realizar su función prevista. Por lo tanto, cualquier coordinación de este tipo debe incurrir en una sobrecarga mínima de la red. Cortas de tiempo cortas: agravar aún más el problema es la necesidad de propagar inmediatamente los datos sensoriales de RF actualizados, para permitir que los dispositivos reaccionen de manera oportuna. Esto es especialmente cierto debido a la movilidad, ya que pueden ocurrir cambios rápidos del entorno de RF debido a los movimientos de dispositivos y obstáculos. Aquí, el desvanecimiento y las habilidades de detección de múltiples interferencias de múltiples impactos. El nivel de señal puede caer a un nulo profundo con solo un movimiento λ/4 en la posición del receptor (3.7 cm a 2 GHz), donde λ es la longitud de onda [14]. La coordinación que no respalda la difusión rápida de la información no podrá tener en cuenta tales variaciones de RF. Datos sensoriales grandes: debido a que las radios cognitivos pueden usar potencialmente cualquier parte del espectro de RF, habrá numerosos canales que necesitan escanear. Supongamos que deseamos calcular la energía de señal promedio en cada una de las 100 bandas de frecuencia discretizadas, y cada señal puede tener hasta 128 niveles de energía discretos. El intercambio de información sensorial completa entre nodos requeriría 700 bits por transmisión (para 100 canales, cada uno que requiere siete bits de información). El intercambio de esta información entre un pequeño grupo de 50 dispositivos cada segundo requeriría (50 dispositivos de tiempo × 50 × 700 bits por transmisión) = 1.67 Mbps de ancho de banda de red agregada. Compare esto con el uso de un protocolo de chismes aleatorizado para difundir dicha información y el uso de vectores de bits FM para realizar la agregación en la red. Al aplicar la agregación de chismes y FM, los requisitos de ancho de banda agregados se caen a (C · Logn Time-Steps × 50 dispositivos × 700 bits por transmisión) = 0.40 Mbps, ya que se necesitan 12 pasos de tiempo para propagar los datos (con C = 2, paraPROFOES ILUSTRATIVO1). Esto se explica más a fondo en la Sección 4. Según estas ideas, proponemos Guess, un enfoque de bajo nivel que utiliza extensiones incrementales a la agregación de FM y los chismes aleatorios para una coordinación eficiente dentro de una red de radio cognitiva. Como mostramos en la Sección 7, 1 tiempo de convergencia se correlaciona con la topología de conectividad de los dispositivos, que a su vez depende del entorno.13 X A A X B B X Figura 2: Uso de la agregación de FM para calcular el nivel de señal promedio medido por un grupo de dispositivos.Estas extensiones incrementales pueden reducir aún más los requisitos de ancho de banda hasta un factor de 2.4 sobre los enfoques estándar discutidos anteriormente.3. La investigación laboral relacionada en la radio cognitiva ha aumentado rápidamente [4, 17] a lo largo de los años, y se está proyectando como una de las principales tecnologías habilitadoras para las redes inalámbricas del futuro [9]. Como se mencionó anteriormente, la FCC ya ha identificado nuevos regímenes para el intercambio de espectro entre usuarios primarios y usuarios secundarios y se ha propuesto una variedad de sistemas en la literatura para admitir dicho intercambio [4, 17]. Detectar la presencia de un usuario primario no es trivial, especialmente un usuario primario heredado que no es consciente de la radio cognitiva. Los usuarios secundarios deben poder detectar el primario incluso si no pueden decodificar adecuadamente sus señales. Esto ha sido demostrado por Sahai et al.[16] Ser extremadamente difícil incluso si se conoce el esquema de modulación. Se requiere hardware sofisticado y costoso, más allá de un simple detector de energía, para mejorar la precisión de la detección de señales [16]. Además, un usuario secundario sombreado es posible que ni siquiera pueda detectar señales de la primaria. Como resultado, los enfoques de detección locales simples no han ganado mucho impulso. Esto ha motivado la necesidad de cooperación entre las radios cognitivos [16]. Más recientemente, algunos investigadores han propuesto enfoques para la coordinación de la radio. Liu et al.[11] Considere una arquitectura de punto de acceso centralizado (o estación base) en la que la información de detección se envía a APS para fines de asignación de espectro. APS dirige a los clientes móviles a recopilar dicha información de detección en su nombre. Sin embargo, debido a la necesidad de una infraestructura AP fija, este enfoque centralizado claramente no es escalable. En otro trabajo, Zhao et al.[17] propone un enfoque de coordinación distribuido para la detección y asignación del espectro. Las radios cognitivas se organizan en grupos y la coordinación ocurre dentro de los grupos. La arquitectura Corvus [4] propone un método de agrupación similar que puede usar un enfoque centralizado o descentralizado para administrar grupos. Aunque una mejora sobre los enfoques puramente centralizados, estas técnicas aún requieren una fase de configuración para generar los grupos, lo que no solo agrega retraso adicional, sino que también requiere que muchos de los usuarios secundarios sean estáticos o cuasiestáticos. Por el contrario, Guess no impone tales restricciones a los usuarios secundarios, e incluso puede funcionar en entornos altamente móviles.4. Antecedentes Esta sección proporciona los antecedentes de nuestro enfoque. Presentamos el esquema de agregación FM que usamos para generar resúmenes de espectro y realizar una agregación en la red. También discutimos las técnicas aleatorias de chismes para difundir agregados en una red de radio cognitiva.4.1 La agregación de agregación de FM es el proceso donde los nodos en una red distribuida combinan datos recibidos de nodos vecinos con su valor local para generar un agregado combinado. Este agregado se comunica luego a otros nodos en la red y este proceso se repite hasta que el agregado en todos los nodos haya convergido con el mismo valor, es decir, el agregado global. El doble conteo es un problema bien conocido en este proceso, donde los nodos pueden contribuir más de una vez al agregado, causando inexactitud en el resultado final. Intuitivamente, los nodos pueden etiquetar el valor agregado que transmiten con información sobre qué nodos han contribuido a él. Sin embargo, este enfoque no es escalable. Orden y técnicas duplicadas insensibles (ODI) se han propuesto en la literatura [10, 15]. Adoptamos el enfoque ODI pionero por Flajolet y Martin (FM) a los efectos de la agregación. A continuación, describimos el enfoque FM;Para obtener todos los detalles, ver [7]. Supongamos que queremos calcular el número de nodos en la red, es decir, la consulta de recuento. Para hacerlo, cada nodo realiza un experimento de lanzamiento de monedas de la siguiente manera: tirar una moneda imparcial, detenerse después de que se ve la primera cabeza. El nodo luego establece el bit ésimo en un vector de bits (inicialmente lleno de ceros), donde yo es la cantidad de lanzamientos de monedas que realizó. La intuición es que a medida que aumenta el número de nodos que realizan experimentos de lanzamiento de monedas, aumenta la probabilidad de que se establezca un bit más significativo en uno de los vectores de bit nodos. Estos vectores de bit se intercambian entre nodos. Cuando un nodo recibe un vector de bits, actualiza su vector de bits local al oírlo bit a bits con el vector recibido (como se muestra en la Figura 2 que calcula el promedio). Al final del proceso de agregación, cada nodo, con alta probabilidad, tiene el mismo vector de bits. El valor real del agregado de recuento se calcula luego utilizando la siguiente fórmula, AGGF M = 2J - 1 /0.77351, donde J representa la posición de bit de la cero menos significativa en el vector de bits agregados [7]. Aunque dichos agregados son de naturaleza muy compacta, que requieren solo el espacio de estado o (logn) (donde n es el número de nodos), pueden no ser muy precisos, ya que solo pueden aproximar los valores al poder más cercano de 2, lo que puede causar errores dehasta 50%. Se pueden calcular agregados más precisos manteniendo múltiples vectores de bits en cada nodo, como se explica en [7]. Esto disminuye el error dentro de O (1/ √ m), donde M es el número de tales vectores de bits. Las consultas que no sean el recuento también se pueden calcular utilizando variantes de este algoritmo de conteo básico, como se discutió en [3] (y se muestra en la Figura 2). La transmisión de vectores de bits FM entre nodos se realiza utilizando chismes aleatorios, discutidos a continuación.4.2 Protocolos de chismes Los protocolos basados en chismes operan en pasos de tiempo discretos;Un paso de tiempo es la cantidad de tiempo requerida para que todas las transmisiones en ese paso se completen. En cada paso de tiempo, cada nodo que tiene algo para enviar al azar selecciona uno o más nodos vecinos y les transmite sus datos. La propagación aleatoria de información proporciona tolerancia a fallas y resistencia a las fallas y interrupciones de la red. Hacemos hincapié en que esta característica del protocolo también le permite operar sin confiar en ninguna estructura de red subyacente. Se ha demostrado que los protocolos de chismes proporcionan una convergencia exponencialmente rápida2, en el orden de O (log n) [10], donde n es el número de nodos (o radios). Por lo tanto, estos protocolos pueden escalar fácilmente a entornos muy densos.2 La convergencia se refiere al estado en el que todos los nodos tienen la visión más actualizada de la red.14 Dos tipos de protocolos de chismes son: • Chismes uniformes: en chismes uniformes, en cada paso de tiempo, cada nodo elige a un vecino aleatorio y le envía sus datos. Este proceso se repite para los pasos O (log (n)) (donde n es el número de nodos en la red). Uniforme Gossip proporciona una convergencia exponencialmente rápida, con una sobrecarga de red baja [10].• Caminata aleatoria: en caminata aleatoria, solo un subconjunto de los nodos (denominados nodos designados) se comunica en un paso de tiempo particular. Al inicio, los nodos K son elegidos al azar como nodos designados. En cada paso de tiempo, cada nodo designado envía sus datos a un vecino aleatorio, que se designa para el paso de tiempo posterior (al igual que pasar un token). Este proceso se repite hasta que el agregado ha convergido en la red. Se ha demostrado que la caminata aleatoria proporciona límites de convergencia similares como chismes uniformes en problemas de contexto similar [8, 12].5. Protocolos incrementales 5.1 Agregados de FM incrementales Una limitación de la agregación de FM es que no admite actualizaciones. Debido a la naturaleza probabilística de FM, una vez que los vectores de bits se han orado juntos, la información no se puede eliminar simplemente de ellos ya que no se ha registrado la contribución de cada nodo. Proponemos el uso de vectores Eliminar, una extensión de FM para admitir actualizaciones. Mantenemos un vector de eliminación agregado separado cuyo valor se resta del valor de vectores agregados originales para obtener el valor resultante de la siguiente manera. Agginc = (2a - 1 /0.77351) - (2b - 1 /0.77351) (1) Aquí, A y B representan las posiciones de bit de la cero menos significativa en los vectores de bits originales y eliminados respectivamente. Supongamos que deseamos calcular el nivel de señal promedio detectado en una frecuencia particular. Para calcular esto, calculamos la suma de todas las mediciones de nivel de señal y dividimos que por el recuento del número de mediciones. Un agregado de suma se calcula de manera similar al recuento (explicado en la Sección 4.1), excepto que cada nodo realiza experimentos de lanzamiento de monedas S, donde S es el nivel de señal medido localmente. La Figura 2 ilustra la secuencia por la cual la energía de señal promedio se calcula en una banda particular utilizando la agregación de FM. Ahora suponga que la señal medida en un nodo cambia de s a s. Los vectores se actualizan de la siguiente manera.• S> S: simplemente realizamos (s - s) más experimentos de lanzamiento de monedas y bit a bit o el resultado con el vector de bits original.• S <S: Aumentamos el valor del vector de eliminación realizando (S - s) experimentos de lanzamiento de monedas y bit a bit a bit o el resultado con el vector de eliminación actual. Utilizando los vectores Eliminar, ahora podemos admitir actualizaciones al nivel de señal medido. Con la implementación original de FM, el agregado necesitaría ser descartado y uno nuevo recomputado cada vez que ocurriera una actualización. Por lo tanto, Eliminar los vectores proporcionan una alternativa de sobrecarga baja para aplicaciones cuyos datos cambian de forma incremental, como las mediciones de nivel de señal en un entorno de detección de espectro coordinado. A continuación, discutimos cómo estos agregados pueden comunicarse entre dispositivos utilizando protocolos de enrutamiento incremental.5.2 Protocolo de enrutamiento incremental Utilizamos las siguientes variantes incrementales de los protocolos de enrutamiento presentados en la Sección 4.2 para admitir actualizaciones incrementales a agregados previamente calculados. Actualización recibida o actualización local Se produce una sello de tiempo susceptible recuperado expira el estado inicial Actualización adicional Actualización Infecciosa Recibida Figura 3: Diagrama de estado que se pasa cada dispositivo a medida que avanzan en el sistema • Protocolo de chismes incrementales (IGP): Cuando ocurre una actualización, la actualización actualizadaEl nodo inicia el procedimiento de chismes. Otros nodos solo comienzan a chismear una vez que reciben la actualización. Por lo tanto, los nodos que reciben la actualización se activa y continúan comunicándose con sus vecinos hasta que el protocolo de actualización termine, después de los pasos de tiempo O (log (n)).• Protocolo de caminata aleatoria incremental (IRWP): cuando se produce una actualización (o actualizaciones) en el sistema, en lugar de comenzar caminatas aleatorias en K a los nodos aleatorios en la red, todas las caminatas aleatorias se inician desde los nodos actualizados. El resto del protocolo procede de la misma manera que el protocolo estándar de caminata aleatoria. La asignación de caminatas a las actualizaciones se discute con más detalle en [3], donde los autores muestran que el número de caminatas tiene un impacto casi insignificante en la sobrecarga de la red.6. Los detalles del protocolo utilizando protocolos de enrutamiento incremental para difundir agregados de FM incrementales son un ajuste natural para el problema de la detección de espectro coordinado. Aquí describimos la implementación de tales técnicas para una red de radio cognitiva. Continuamos con el ejemplo de la Sección 5.1, donde deseamos realizar una coordinación entre un grupo de dispositivos inalámbricos para calcular el nivel de señal promedio en una banda de frecuencia particular. Utilizando una caminata aleatoria incremental o chismes incrementales, cada dispositivo avanza a través de tres fases, para determinar el nivel de señal promedio global para una banda de frecuencia particular. La Figura 3 muestra un diagrama de estado de estas fases. Susceptible: cada dispositivo comienza en el estado susceptible y se vuelve infeccioso solo cuando su nivel de señal medido localmente cambia, o si recibe un mensaje de actualización de un dispositivo vecino. Si se observa un cambio local, el dispositivo actualiza el vector de bits original o de eliminación, como se describe en la Sección 5.1, y se mueve al estado infeccioso. Si recibe un mensaje de actualización, ors los vectores de bits originales y eliminados recibidos con sus vectores de bits locales y se mueve al estado infeccioso. Nota, Debido a que las mediciones del nivel de señal pueden cambiar esporádicamente con el tiempo, se debe aplicar una función de suavizado, como un promedio móvil ponderado exponencialmente a estas mediciones. Infeccioso: una vez que un dispositivo es infeccioso, continúa enviando sus vectores de bits actualizados, utilizando una caminata aleatoria incremental o chismes incrementales, a los nodos vecinos. Debido al orden FMS y las propiedades insensibles duplicadas (ODI), el protocolo manejan a la perfección las actualizaciones que ocurren simultáneamente. Los mensajes de actualización contienen una marca de tiempo que indica cuándo se generó la actualización, y cada dispositivo mantiene un LO15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1 10 100 100 Número de cambios de señal medidos ESECUCIÓN (MS) Gossip uniformes de chismes incrementales (a) Gossip incrementales y chismes uniformesClique 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1 10 100 Número de cambios de señal medidos ExecutionTime (MS).

Usando esta información, un dispositivo se mueve al estado recuperado una vez que ha pasado suficiente tiempo para que la actualización más reciente haya convergido. Como se discutió en la Sección 4.2, esto sucede después de los pasos de tiempo O (log (n)). Recuperado: un dispositivo recuperado deja de propagar cualquier información de actualización. En este punto, realiza la limpieza y se prepara para la próxima infección al ingresar al estado susceptible. Una vez que todos los dispositivos hayan ingresado al estado recuperado, el sistema habrá convergente, y con alta probabilidad, todos los dispositivos tendrán el nivel de señal promedio actualizado. Debido a la naturaleza acumulativa de FM, incluso si todos los dispositivos no han convergido, la próxima actualización incluirá todas las actualizaciones anteriores. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el chisme no converja es pequeña, y se ha demostrado que es O (1/n) [10]. Para la detección de espectro coordinado, los protocolos de enrutamiento no incrementales se pueden implementar de manera similar. La caminata aleatoria operaría haciendo que los dispositivos eliminen periódicamente el agregado y vuelva a ejecutar el protocolo. Cada dispositivo realizaría un lanzamiento de monedas (sesgado en el número de caminatas) para determinar si es o no un nodo designado. Esto es diferente del protocolo discutido anteriormente, donde solo los nodos actualizados inician caminatas aleatorias. Se pueden utilizar técnicas similares para implementar chismes estándar.7. Evaluación ahora proporcionamos una evaluación preliminar de la suposición en la simulación. Se puede encontrar una evaluación más detallada de este enfoque en [3]. Aquí nos centramos en cómo las extensiones incrementales a los protocolos de chismes pueden conducir a mejoras adicionales sobre las técnicas de chismes estándar, para el problema de la detección de espectro coordinado. Configuración de simulación: implementamos un simulador personalizado en C ++. Estudiamos las mejoras de nuestros protocolos de chismes incrementales sobre el chisme estándar en dos dimensiones: tiempo de ejecución y sobrecarga de red. Utilizamos dos topologías para representar la conectividad del dispositivo: una camarilla, para eliminar los efectos de la topología subyacente en el rendimiento del protocolo, y un gráfico aleatorio de la ley de potencia generado por Bite (PLRG), para ilustrar cómo se extienden nuestros resultados a más realistasescenarios. Simulamos una gran implementación de 1,000 dispositivos para analizar la escalabilidad del protocolo. En nuestras simulaciones, calculamos el nivel de señal promedio en una banda particular al difundir los vectores de bits FM. En cada ejecución de la simulación, inducimos un cambio en la señal medida en uno o más dispositivos. Una ejecución finaliza cuando el nuevo nivel de señal promedio ha convergido en la red. Para cada punto de datos, ejecutamos 100 simulaciones y se muestran los intervalos de confianza del 95% (barras de error). Parámetros de simulación: cada transmisión implica enviar 70 bits de información a un nodo vecino. Para calcular el agregado promedio, se deben transmitir vectores de cuatro bits: el vector de suma original, el vector de eliminación de suma, el vector de conteo original y el vector de eliminación de recuento. Los protocolos no incrementales no transmiten los vectores Eliminar. Cada transmisión también incluye una marca de tiempo de cuándo se generó la actualización. Suponemos que los nodos se comunican en un canal de control común a 2 Mbps. Por lo tanto, un paso de tiempo de ejecución del protocolo corresponde al tiempo requerido para que 1,000 nodos envíen secuencialmente 70 bits a 2 Mbps. El uso secuencial del canal de control es el peor de los casos para nuestros protocolos;En la práctica, se podrían usar múltiples canales de control en paralelo para reducir el tiempo de ejecución. También asumimos que los nodos están sincronizados en el tiempo, cuyas implicaciones se discuten más en [3]. Finalmente, para aislar el efecto de la operación del protocolo en el rendimiento, no modelamos las complejidades del canal inalámbrico en nuestras simulaciones. Los protocolos incrementales reducen el tiempo de ejecución: la Figura 4 (a) compara el rendimiento de los chismes incrementales (IGP) con chismes uniformes en una topología de camarilla. Observamos que ambos protocolos tienen tiempos de ejecución casi idénticos. Esto se espera ya que IGP opera de manera similar a 16 chismes uniformes, tomando los pasos de tiempo O (log (N)) para converger. La Figura 4 (b) compara los tiempos de ejecución de la caminata aleatoria incremental (IRWP) y la caminata aleatoria estándar en una camarilla. IRWP reduce el tiempo de ejecución en un factor de 2.7 para un pequeño número de cambios de señal medidos. Aunque la caminata aleatoria y el IRWP usan k caminatas aleatorias (en nuestras simulaciones k = número de nodos), IRWP inicia caminatas solo desde nodos actualizados (como se explica en la Sección 5.2), lo que resulta en una convergencia de información más rápida. Estas mejoras también se trasladan a una topología PLRG (como se muestra en la Figura 4 (c)), donde IRWP es 1.33 veces más rápido que la caminata aleatoria. Los protocolos incrementales reducen la sobrecarga de la red: la Figura 5 (a) muestra la relación de datos transmitidos utilizando chismes uniformes en relación con los chismes incrementales en una camarilla. Para un pequeño número de cambios en la señal, los chismes incrementales incurre en 2.4 veces menos sobrecarga que los chismes uniformes. Esto se debe a que en los primeros pasos de la ejecución del protocolo, solo los dispositivos que detectan los cambios de señal se comunican. A medida que se introducen más cambios de señal en el sistema, los chismes y los chismes incrementales incurren aproximadamente a la misma sobrecarga. Del mismo modo, la caminata aleatoria incremental (IRWP) incurre en mucho menos sobrecarga que la caminata aleatoria estándar. La Figura 5 (b) muestra una reducción de 2.7 veces en la sobrecarga para pequeños números de cambios de señal en una camarilla. Aunque cada protocolo utiliza el mismo número de caminatas aleatorias, IRWP utiliza menos recursos de red que la caminata aleatoria porque lleva menos tiempo converger. Esta mejora también es válida en topologías PLRG más complejas (como se muestra en la Figura 5 (c)), donde observamos una reducción del 33% en la sobrecarga de la red. A partir de estos resultados, está claro que las técnicas incrementales producen mejoras significativas sobre los enfoques estándar para los chismes, incluso en topologías complejas. Debido a que la utilización del espectro se caracteriza por cambios incrementales en el uso, los protocolos incrementales son ideales para resolver este problema de manera eficiente y rentable.8. Discusión y trabajo futuro Acabamos de rascar la superficie para abordar el problema de la detección de espectro coordinado utilizando el chismoso incremental. A continuación, describimos algunas áreas abiertas de investigación. Decadencia espacial: los dispositivos que realizan una detección coordinada están interesados principalmente en el uso del espectro de su vecindario local. Por lo tanto, recomendamos el uso de agregados en descomposición espacial [6], lo que limita el impacto de una actualización en nodos más distantes. Los agregados en descomposición espacialmente funcionan reduciendo sucesivamente (por medio de una función de descomposición) el valor de la actualización a medida que se propaga más de su origen. Un desafío con este enfoque es que la distancia de propagación no se puede determinar con anticipación y, lo que es más importante, exhibe variaciones espacio-temporales. Por lo tanto, encontrar la función de descomposición óptima no es trivial y un tema interesante de trabajo futuro. Umbral de significado: las bandas de espectro de RF continuamente experimentan cambios a pequeña escala que pueden no ser necesariamente significativas. Decidir si un cambio es significativo puede realizarse utilizando un umbral de significancia β, por debajo del cual cualquier cambio observado no es propagado por el nodo. Elegir un valor operativo apropiado para β depende de la aplicación y explora más a fondo en [3]. Lecturas ponderadas: aunque argumentamos que la mayoría de los dispositivos probablemente estarán equipados con equipos de detección de bajo costo, puede haber situaciones en las que hay algunos nodos de infraestructura especiales que tienen mejores habilidades de detección que otros. Ponderar sus medidas más en gran medida podría usarse para mantener un mayor grado de precisión. Determinar cómo asignar tales pesos es un área abierta de investigación. Decuestros de implementación: Finalmente, la implementación de chismes para la detección de espectro coordinado también está abierto. Si se implementa en la capa MAC, puede ser factible los mensajes de chismes de respaldo sobre los cuadros de administración existentes (por ejemplo, mensajes publicitarios de red). Además, también requerimos el uso de un canal de control para difundir la información de detección. Hay una variedad de alternativas para implementar dicho canal, algunas de las cuales se describen en [4]. Las compensaciones de diferentes enfoques para implementar Guess son un tema de trabajo futuro.9. Conclusión La detección del espectro es un requisito clave para la asignación de espectro dinámico en redes de radio cognitivas. La naturaleza del entorno RF requiere la coordinación entre los dispositivos de radio cognitivos. Proponemos Guess, un enfoque aproximado pero bajo para realizar una coordinación eficiente entre las radios cognitivas. Las contribuciones fundamentales de Guess son: (1) un esquema de agregación de FM para una agregación eficiente de innetwork, (2) un enfoque de chismes aleatorios que proporciona una convergencia exponencialmente rápida y robustez a las alteraciones de la red, y (3) variaciones incrementales de FM y chismes que mostramosPuede reducir el tiempo de comunicación hasta un factor de 2.7 y reducir la sobrecarga de la red hasta un factor de 2.4. Nuestros resultados de simulación preliminares muestran los beneficios de este enfoque y también describimos un conjunto de problemas abiertos que hacen de este un área de investigación nueva y emocionante.10.

        "Currently, the FCC has licensed RF spectrum to a variety of public and private institutions, termed primary users.",
        "New spectrum allocation regimes implemented by the FCC use dynamic spectrum access schemes to either negotiate or opportunistically allocate RF spectrum to unlicensed secondary users Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.",

        "The second type of allocation scheme is termed opportunistic spectrum sharing.",
        "The FCC has already legislated this access method for the 5 GHz band and is also considering the same for TV broadcast bands [1].",
        "As a result, a new wave of intelligent radios, termed cognitive radios (or software defined radios), is emerging that can dynamically re-tune their radio parameters based on interactions with their surrounding environment.",
        "Under the new opportunistic allocation strategy, secondary users are obligated not to interfere with primary users (senders or receivers).",
        "This can be done by sensing the environment to detect the presence of primary users.",
        "However, local sensing is not always adequate, especially in cases where a secondary user is shadowed from a primary user, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Here, coordination between secondary users is the only way for shadowed users to detect the primary.",
        "In general, cooperation improves sensing accuracy by an order of magnitude when compared to not cooperating at all [5].",
        "To realize this vision of dynamic spectrum access, two fundamental problems must be solved: (1) Efficient and coordinated spectrum sensing and (2) Distributed spectrum allocation.",
        "In this paper, we propose strategies for coordinated spectrum sensing that are low cost, operate on timescales comparable to the agility of the RF environment, and are resilient to network failures and alterations.",
        "We defer the problem of spectrum allocation to future work.",
        "Spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio networks [4, 17] are broadly classified into three regimes; (1) centralized coordinated techniques, (2) decentralized coordinated techniques, and (3) decentralized uncoordinated techniques.",
        "We advocate a decentralized coordinated approach, similar in spirit to OSPF link-state routing used in the Internet.",
        "This is more effective than uncoordinated approaches because making decisions based only on local information is fallible (as shown in Figure 1).",
        "Moreover, compared to cen12 tralized approaches, decentralized techniques are more scalable, robust, and resistant to network failures and security attacks (e.g. jamming).",
        "Coordinating sensory data between cognitive radio devices is technically challenging because accurately assessing spectrum usage requires exchanging potentially large amounts of data with many radios at very short time scales.",
        "Data size grows rapidly due to the large number (i.e. thousands) of spectrum bands that must be scanned.",
        "This data must also be exchanged between potentially hundreds of neighboring secondary users at short time scales, to account for rapid changes in the RF environment.",
        "This paper presents GUESS, a novel approach to coordinated spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks.",
        "Our approach is motivated by the following key observations: 1.",
        "Low-cost sensors collect approximate data: Most devices have limited sensing resolution because they are low-cost and low duty-cycle devices and thus cannot perform complex RF signal processing (e.g. matched filtering).",
        "Many are typically equipped with simple energy detectors that gather only approximate information. 2.",
        "Approximate summaries are sufficient for coordination: Approximate statistical summaries of sensed data are sufficient for correlating sensed information between radios, as relative usage information is more important than absolute usage data.",
        "Thus, exchanging exact RF information may not be necessary, and more importantly, too costly for the purposes of spectrum sensing. 3.",
        "RF spectrum changes incrementally: On most bands, RF spectrum utilization changes infrequently.",
        "Moreover, utilization of a specific RF band affects only that band and not the entire spectrum.",
        "Therefore, if the usage pattern of a particular band changes substantially, nodes detecting that change can initiate an update protocol to update the information for that band alone, leaving in place information already collected for other bands.",
        "This allows rapid detection of change while saving the overhead of exchanging unnecessary information.",
        "Based on these observations, GUESS makes the following contributions: 1.",
        "A novel approach that applies randomized gossiping algorithms to the problem of coordinated spectrum sensing.",
        "These algorithms are well suited to coordinated spectrum sensing due to the unique characteristics of the problem: i.e. radios are power-limited, mobile and have limited bandwidth to support spectrum sensing capabilities. 2.",
        "An application of in-network aggregation for dissemination of spectrum summaries.",
        "We argue that approximate summaries are adequate for performing accurate radio parameter tuning. 3.",
        "An extension of in-network aggregation and randomized gossiping to support incremental maintenance of spectrum summaries.",
        "Compared to standard gossiping approaches, incremental techniques can further reduce overhead and protocol execution time by requiring fewer radio resources.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 motivates the need for a low cost and efficient approach to coordinated spectrum sensing.",
        "Section 3 discusses related work in the area, while Section 4 provides a background on in-network aggregation and randomized gossiping.",
        "Sections 5 and 6 discuss extensions and protocol details of these techniques for coordinated spectrum sensing.",
        "Section 7 presents simulation results showcasing the benefits of GUESS, and Section 8 presents a discussion and some directions for future work. 2.",
        "MOTIVATION To estimate the scale of the problem, In-stat predicts that the number of WiFi-enabled devices sold annually alone will grow to 430 million by 2009 [2].",
        "Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that a typical dense urban environment will contain several thousand cognitive radio devices in range of each other.",
        "As a result, distributed spectrum sensing and allocation would become both important and fundamental.",
        "Coordinated sensing among secondary radios is essential due to limited device sensing resolution and physical RF effects such as shadowing.",
        "Cabric et al. [5] illustrate the gains from cooperation and show an order of magnitude reduction in the probability of interference with the primary user when only a small fraction of secondary users cooperate.",
        "However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.",
        "Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.",
        "This implies that both data and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a single radio interface.",
        "Therefore, any time spent communicating sensory information takes away from the devices ability to perform its intended function.",
        "Thus, any such coordination must incur minimal network overhead.",
        "Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely fashion.",
        "This is especially true due to mobility, as rapid changes of the RF environment can occur due to device and obstacle movements.",
        "Here, fading and multi-path interference heavily impact sensing abilities.",
        "Signal level can drop to a deep null with just a λ/4 movement in receiver position (3.7 cm at 2 GHz), where λ is the wavelength [14].",
        "Coordination which does not support rapid dissemination of information will not be able to account for such RF variations.",
        "Large Sensory Data: Because cognitive radios can potentially use any part of the RF spectrum, there will be numerous channels that they need to scan.",
        "Suppose we wish to compute the average signal energy in each of 100 discretized frequency bands, and each signal can have up to 128 discrete energy levels.",
        "Exchanging complete sensory information between nodes would require 700 bits per transmission (for 100 channels, each requiring seven bits of information).",
        "Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate network bandwidth.",
        "Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation.",
        "By applying gossip and FM aggregation, aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to (c·logN time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 0.40 Mbps, since 12 time-steps are needed to propagate the data (with c = 2, for illustrative purpoes1 ).",
        "This is explained further in Section 4.",
        "Based on these insights, we propose GUESS, a low-overhead approach which uses incremental extensions to FM aggregation and randomized gossiping for efficient coordination within a cognitive radio network.",
        "As we show in Section 7, 1 Convergence time is correlated with the connectivity topology of the devices, which in turn depends on the environment. 13 X A A X B B X Figure 2: Using FM aggregation to compute average signal level measured by a group of devices. these incremental extensions can further reduce bandwidth requirements by up to a factor of 2.4 over the standard approaches discussed above. 3.",
        "RELATED WORK Research in cognitive radio has increased rapidly [4, 17] over the years, and it is being projected as one of the leading enabling technologies for wireless networks of the future [9].",
        "As mentioned earlier, the FCC has already identified new regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed in the literature to support such sharing [4, 17].",
        "Detecting the presence of a primary user is non-trivial, especially a legacy primary user that is not cognitive radio aware.",
        "Secondary users must be able to detect the primary even if they cannot properly decode its signals.",
        "This has been shown by Sahai et al. [16] to be extremely difficult even if the modulation scheme is known.",
        "Sophisticated and costly hardware, beyond a simple energy detector, is required to improve signal detection accuracy [16].",
        "Moreover, a shadowed secondary user may not even be able to detect signals from the primary.",
        "As a result, simple local sensing approaches have not gained much momentum.",
        "This has motivated the need for cooperation among cognitive radios [16].",
        "More recently, some researchers have proposed approaches for radio coordination.",
        "Liu et al. [11] consider a centralized access point (or base station) architecture in which sensing information is forwarded to APs for spectrum allocation purposes.",
        "APs direct mobile clients to collect such sensing information on their behalf.",
        "However, due to the need of a fixed AP infrastructure, such a centralized approach is clearly not scalable.",
        "In other work, Zhao et al. [17] propose a distributed coordination approach for spectrum sensing and allocation.",
        "Cognitive radios organize into clusters and coordination occurs within clusters.",
        "The CORVUS [4] architecture proposes a similar clustering method that can use either a centralized or decentralized approach to manage clusters.",
        "Although an improvement over purely centralized approaches, these techniques still require a setup phase to generate the clusters, which not only adds additional delay, but also requires many of the secondary users to be static or quasi-static.",
        "In contrast, GUESS does not place such restrictions on secondary users, and can even function in highly mobile environments. 4.",
        "BACKGROUND This section provides the background for our approach.",
        "We present the FM aggregation scheme that we use to generate spectrum summaries and perform in-network aggregation.",
        "We also discuss randomized gossiping techniques for disseminating aggregates in a cognitive radio network. 4.1 FM Aggregation Aggregation is the process where nodes in a distributed network combine data received from neighboring nodes with their local value to generate a combined aggregate.",
        "This aggregate is then communicated to other nodes in the network and this process repeats until the aggregate at all nodes has converged to the same value, i.e. the global aggregate.",
        "Double-counting is a well known problem in this process, where nodes may contribute more than once to the aggregate, causing inaccuracy in the final result.",
        "Intuitively, nodes can tag the aggregate value they transmit with information about which nodes have contributed to it.",
        "However, this approach is not scalable.",
        "Order and Duplicate Insensitive (ODI) techniques have been proposed in the literature [10, 15].",
        "We adopt the ODI approach pioneered by Flajolet and Martin (FM) for the purposes of aggregation.",
        "Next we outline the FM approach; for full details, see [7].",
        "Suppose we want to compute the number of nodes in the network, i.e. the COUNT query.",
        "To do so, each node performs a coin toss experiment as follows: toss an unbiased coin, stopping after the first head is seen.",
        "The node then sets the ith bit in a bit vector (initially filled with zeros), where i is the number of coin tosses it performed.",
        "The intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss experiments increases, the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes bit vectors increases.",
        "These bit vectors are then exchanged among nodes.",
        "When a node receives a bit vector, it updates its local bit vector by bitwise OR-ing it with the received vector (as shown in Figure 2 which computes AVERAGE).",
        "At the end of the aggregation process, every node, with high probability, has the same bit vector.",
        "The actual value of the count aggregate is then computed using the following formula, AGGF M = 2j−1 /0.77351, where j represents the bit position of the least significant zero in the aggregate bit vector [7].",
        "Although such aggregates are very compact in nature, requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%.",
        "More accurate aggregates can be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each node, as explained in [7].",
        "This decreases the error to within O(1/ √ m), where m is the number of such bit vectors.",
        "Queries other than count can also be computed using variants of this basic counting algorithm, as discussed in [3] (and shown in Figure 2).",
        "Transmitting FM bit vectors between nodes is done using randomized gossiping, discussed next. 4.2 Gossip Protocols Gossip-based protocols operate in discrete time-steps; a time-step is the required amount of time for all transmissions in that time-step to complete.",
        "At every time-step, each node having something to send randomly selects one or more neighboring nodes and transmits its data to them.",
        "The randomized propagation of information provides fault-tolerance and resilience to network failures and outages.",
        "We emphasize that this characteristic of the protocol also allows it to operate without relying on any underlying network structure.",
        "Gossip protocols have been shown to provide exponentially fast convergence2 , on the order of O(log N) [10], where N is the number of nodes (or radios).",
        "These protocols can therefore easily scale to very dense environments. 2 Convergence refers to the state in which all nodes have the most up-to-date view of the network. 14 Two types of gossip protocols are: • Uniform Gossip: In uniform gossip, at each timestep, each node chooses a random neighbor and sends its data to it.",
        "This process repeats for O(log(N)) steps (where N is the number of nodes in the network).",
        "Uniform gossip provides exponentially fast convergence, with low network overhead [10]. • Random Walk: In random walk, only a subset of the nodes (termed designated nodes) communicate in a particular time-step.",
        "At startup, k nodes are randomly elected as designated nodes.",
        "In each time-step, each designated node sends its data to a random neighbor, which becomes designated for the subsequent timestep (much like passing a token).",
        "This process repeats until the aggregate has converged in the network.",
        "Random walk has been shown to provide similar convergence bounds as uniform gossip in problems of similar context [8, 12]. 5.",
        "INCREMENTAL PROTOCOLS 5.1 Incremental FM Aggregates One limitation of FM aggregation is that it does not support updates.",
        "Due to the probabilistic nature of FM, once bit vectors have been ORed together, information cannot simply be removed from them as each nodes contribution has not been recorded.",
        "We propose the use of delete vectors, an extension of FM to support updates.",
        "We maintain a separate aggregate delete vector whose value is subtracted from the original aggregate vectors value to obtain the resulting value as follows.",
        "AGGINC = (2a−1 /0.77351) − (2b−1 /0.77351) (1) Here, a and b represent the bit positions of the least significant zero in the original and delete bit vectors respectively.",
        "Suppose we wish to compute the average signal level detected in a particular frequency.",
        "To compute this, we compute the SUM of all signal level measurements and divide that by the COUNT of the number of measurements.",
        "A SUM aggregate is computed similar to COUNT (explained in Section 4.1), except that each node performs s coin toss experiments, where s is the locally measured signal level.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the sequence by which the average signal energy is computed in a particular band using FM aggregation.",
        "Now suppose that the measured signal at a node changes from s to s .",
        "The vectors are updated as follows. • s > s: We simply perform (s − s) more coin toss experiments and bitwise OR the result with the original bit vector. • s < s: We increase the value of the delete vector by performing (s − s ) coin toss experiments and bitwise OR the result with the current delete vector.",
        "Using delete vectors, we can now support updates to the measured signal level.",
        "With the original implementation of FM, the aggregate would need to be discarded and a new one recomputed every time an update occurred.",
        "Thus, delete vectors provide a low overhead alternative for applications whose data changes incrementally, such as signal level measurements in a coordinated spectrum sensing environment.",
        "Next we discuss how these aggregates can be communicated between devices using incremental routing protocols. 5.2 Incremental Routing Protocol We use the following incremental variants of the routing protocols presented in Section 4.2 to support incremental updates to previously computed aggregates.",
        "Update Received OR Local Update Occurs Recovered Susceptible Time-stamp Expires Initial State Additional Update Received Infectious Clean Up Figure 3: State diagram each device passes through as updates proceed in the system • Incremental Gossip Protocol (IGP): When an update occurs, the updated node initiates the gossiping procedure.",
        "Other nodes only begin gossiping once they receive the update.",
        "Therefore, nodes receiving the update become active and continue communicating with their neighbors until the update protocol terminates, after O(log(N)) time steps. • Incremental Random Walk Protocol (IRWP): When an update (or updates) occur in the system, instead of starting random walks at k random nodes in the network, all k random walks are initiated from the updated node(s).",
        "The rest of the protocol proceeds in the same fashion as the standard random walk protocol.",
        "The allocation of walks to updates is discussed in more detail in [3], where the authors show that the number of walks has an almost negligible impact on network overhead. 6.",
        "PROTOCOL DETAILS Using incremental routing protocols to disseminate incremental FM aggregates is a natural fit for the problem of coordinated spectrum sensing.",
        "Here we outline the implementation of such techniques for a cognitive radio network.",
        "We continue with the example from Section 5.1, where we wish to perform coordination between a group of wireless devices to compute the average signal level in a particular frequency band.",
        "Using either incremental random walk or incremental gossip, each device proceeds through three phases, in order to determine the global average signal level for a particular frequency band.",
        "Figure 3 shows a state diagram of these phases.",
        "Susceptible: Each device starts in the susceptible state and becomes infectious only when its locally measured signal level changes, or if it receives an update message from a neighboring device.",
        "If a local change is observed, the device updates either the original or delete bit vector, as described in Section 5.1, and moves into the infectious state.",
        "If it receives an update message, it ORs the received original and delete bit vectors with its local bit vectors and moves into the infectious state.",
        "Note, because signal level measurements may change sporadically over time, a smoothing function, such as an exponentially weighted moving average, should be applied to these measurements.",

        "Spatial Decay: Devices performing coordinated sensing are primarily interested in the spectrum usage of their local neighborhood.",
        "Therefore, we recommend the use of spatially decaying aggregates [6], which limits the impact of an update on more distant nodes.",
        "Spatially decaying aggregates work by successively reducing (by means of a decay function) the value of the update as it propagates further from its origin.",
        "One challenge with this approach is that propagation distance cannot be determined ahead of time and more importantly, exhibits spatio-temporal variations.",
        "Therefore, finding the optimal decay function is non-trivial, and an interesting subject of future work.",
        "Significance Threshold: RF spectrum bands continually experience small-scale changes which may not necessarily be significant.",
        "Deciding if a change is significant can be done using a significance threshold β, below which any observed change is not propagated by the node.",
        "Choosing an appropriate operating value for β is application dependent, and explored further in [3].",
        "Weighted Readings: Although we argued that most devices will likely be equipped with low-cost sensing equipment, there may be situations where there are some special infrastructure nodes that have better sensing abilities than others.",
        "Weighting their measurements more heavily could be used to maintain a higher degree of accuracy.",
        "Determining how to assign such weights is an open area of research.",
        "Implementation Specifics: Finally, implementing gossip for coordinated spectrum sensing is also open.",
        "If implemented at the MAC layer, it may be feasible to piggy-back gossip messages over existing management frames (e.g. networking advertisement messages).",
        "As well, we also require the use of a control channel to disseminate sensing information.",
        "There are a variety of alternatives for implementing such a channel, some of which are outlined in [4].",
        "The trade-offs of different approaches to implementing GUESS is a subject of future work. 9.",
        "CONCLUSION Spectrum sensing is a key requirement for dynamic spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks.",
        "The nature of the RF environment necessitates coordination between cognitive radio devices.",
        "We propose GUESS, an approximate yet low overhead approach to perform efficient coordination between cognitive radios.",
        "The fundamental contributions of GUESS are: (1) an FM aggregation scheme for efficient innetwork aggregation, (2) a randomized gossiping approach which provides exponentially fast convergence and robustness to network alterations, and (3) incremental variations of FM and gossip which we show can reduce the communication time by up to a factor of 2.7 and reduce network overhead by up to a factor of 2.4.",

                "This can be done by sensing the environment to detect the presence of primary users.",

                "Low-cost sensors collect approximate data: Most devices have limited sensing resolution because they are low-cost and low duty-cycle devices and thus cannot perform complex RF signal processing (e.g. matched filtering).",

                "Approximate summaries are sufficient for coordination: Approximate statistical summaries of sensed data are sufficient for correlating sensed information between radios, as relative usage information is more important than absolute usage data.",
                "Thus, exchanging exact RF information may not be necessary, and more importantly, too costly for the purposes of spectrum sensing. 3.",
                "RF spectrum changes incrementally: On most bands, RF spectrum utilization changes infrequently.",
                "Moreover, utilization of a specific RF band affects only that band and not the entire spectrum.",
                "Therefore, if the usage pattern of a particular band changes substantially, nodes detecting that change can initiate an update protocol to update the information for that band alone, leaving in place information already collected for other bands.",
                "This allows rapid detection of change while saving the overhead of exchanging unnecessary information.",

                "Section 7 presents simulation results showcasing the benefits of GUESS, and Section 8 presents a discussion and some directions for future work. 2.",
                "MOTIVATION To estimate the scale of the problem, In-stat predicts that the number of WiFi-enabled devices sold annually alone will grow to 430 million by 2009 [2].",
                "Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that a typical dense urban environment will contain several thousand cognitive radio devices in range of each other.",
                "As a result, distributed spectrum sensing and allocation would become both important and fundamental.",
                "Coordinated sensing among secondary radios is essential due to limited device sensing resolution and physical RF effects such as shadowing.",
                "Cabric et al. [5] illustrate the gains from cooperation and show an order of magnitude reduction in the probability of interference with the primary user when only a small fraction of secondary users cooperate.",
                "However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.",
                "Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.",
                "This implies that both data and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a single radio interface.",
                "Therefore, any time spent communicating sensory information takes away from the devices ability to perform its intended function.",
                "Thus, any such coordination must incur minimal network overhead.",
                "Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely fashion.",
                "This is especially true due to mobility, as rapid changes of the RF environment can occur due to device and obstacle movements.",
                "Here, fading and multi-path interference heavily impact sensing abilities.",
                "Signal level can drop to a deep null with just a λ/4 movement in receiver position (3.7 cm at 2 GHz), where λ is the wavelength [14].",
                "Coordination which does not support rapid dissemination of information will not be able to account for such RF variations.",
                "Large Sensory Data: Because cognitive radios can potentially use any part of the RF spectrum, there will be numerous channels that they need to scan.",
                "Suppose we wish to compute the average signal energy in each of 100 discretized frequency bands, and each signal can have up to 128 discrete energy levels.",
                "Exchanging complete sensory information between nodes would require 700 bits per transmission (for 100 channels, each requiring seven bits of information).",
                "Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate network bandwidth.",
                "Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation.",
                "By applying gossip and FM aggregation, aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to (c·logN time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 0.40 Mbps, since 12 time-steps are needed to propagate the data (with c = 2, for illustrative purpoes1 ).",
                "This is explained further in Section 4.",
                "Based on these insights, we propose GUESS, a low-overhead approach which uses incremental extensions to FM aggregation and randomized gossiping for efficient coordination within a cognitive radio network.",
                "As we show in Section 7, 1 Convergence time is correlated with the connectivity topology of the devices, which in turn depends on the environment. 13 X A A X B B X Figure 2: Using FM aggregation to compute average signal level measured by a group of devices. these incremental extensions can further reduce bandwidth requirements by up to a factor of 2.4 over the standard approaches discussed above. 3.",
                "RELATED WORK Research in cognitive radio has increased rapidly [4, 17] over the years, and it is being projected as one of the leading enabling technologies for wireless networks of the future [9].",
                "As mentioned earlier, the FCC has already identified new regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed in the literature to support such sharing [4, 17].",

                "Sophisticated and costly hardware, beyond a simple energy detector, is required to improve signal detection accuracy [16].",
                "Moreover, a shadowed secondary user may not even be able to detect signals from the primary.",

                "However, due to the need of a fixed AP infrastructure, such a centralized approach is clearly not scalable.",

                "In contrast, GUESS does not place such restrictions on secondary users, and can even function in highly mobile environments. 4.",

                "As a result, a new wave of intelligent radios, termed cognitive radios (or software defined radios), is emerging that can dynamically re-tune their radio parameters based on interactions with their surrounding environment.",
                "Under the new opportunistic allocation strategy, secondary users are obligated not to interfere with primary users (senders or receivers).",
                "This can be done by sensing the environment to detect the presence of primary users.",
                "However, local sensing is not always adequate, especially in cases where a secondary user is shadowed from a primary user, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
                "Here, coordination between secondary users is the only way for shadowed users to detect the primary.",
                "In general, cooperation improves sensing accuracy by an order of magnitude when compared to not cooperating at all [5].",
                "To realize this vision of dynamic spectrum access, two fundamental problems must be solved: (1) Efficient and coordinated spectrum sensing and (2) Distributed spectrum allocation.",
                "In this paper, we propose strategies for coordinated spectrum sensing that are low cost, operate on timescales comparable to the agility of the RF environment, and are resilient to network failures and alterations.",
                "We defer the problem of spectrum allocation to future work.",
                "Spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio networks [4, 17] are broadly classified into three regimes; (1) centralized coordinated techniques, (2) decentralized coordinated techniques, and (3) decentralized uncoordinated techniques.",
                "We advocate a decentralized coordinated approach, similar in spirit to OSPF link-state routing used in the Internet.",
                "This is more effective than uncoordinated approaches because making decisions based only on local information is fallible (as shown in Figure 1).",
                "Moreover, compared to cen12 tralized approaches, decentralized techniques are more scalable, robust, and resistant to network failures and security attacks (e.g. jamming).",

                "Data size grows rapidly due to the large number (i.e. thousands) of spectrum bands that must be scanned.",
                "This data must also be exchanged between potentially hundreds of neighboring secondary users at short time scales, to account for rapid changes in the RF environment.",
                "This paper presents GUESS, a novel approach to coordinated spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks.",
                "Our approach is motivated by the following key observations: 1.",
                "Low-cost sensors collect approximate data: Most devices have limited sensing resolution because they are low-cost and low duty-cycle devices and thus cannot perform complex RF signal processing (e.g. matched filtering).",
                "Many are typically equipped with simple energy detectors that gather only approximate information. 2.",
                "Approximate summaries are sufficient for coordination: Approximate statistical summaries of sensed data are sufficient for correlating sensed information between radios, as relative usage information is more important than absolute usage data.",
                "Thus, exchanging exact RF information may not be necessary, and more importantly, too costly for the purposes of spectrum sensing. 3.",
                "<br>rf spectrum</br> changes incrementally: On most bands, <br>rf spectrum</br> utilization changes infrequently.",
                "Moreover, utilization of a specific RF band affects only that band and not the entire spectrum.",
                "Therefore, if the usage pattern of a particular band changes substantially, nodes detecting that change can initiate an update protocol to update the information for that band alone, leaving in place information already collected for other bands.",
                "This allows rapid detection of change while saving the overhead of exchanging unnecessary information.",
                "Based on these observations, GUESS makes the following contributions: 1.",
                "A novel approach that applies randomized gossiping algorithms to the problem of coordinated spectrum sensing.",
                "These algorithms are well suited to coordinated spectrum sensing due to the unique characteristics of the problem: i.e. radios are power-limited, mobile and have limited bandwidth to support spectrum sensing capabilities. 2.",

                "Section 2 motivates the need for a low cost and efficient approach to coordinated spectrum sensing.",

                "Section 7 presents simulation results showcasing the benefits of GUESS, and Section 8 presents a discussion and some directions for future work. 2.",
                "MOTIVATION To estimate the scale of the problem, In-stat predicts that the number of WiFi-enabled devices sold annually alone will grow to 430 million by 2009 [2].",
                "Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that a typical dense urban environment will contain several thousand cognitive radio devices in range of each other.",
                "As a result, distributed spectrum sensing and allocation would become both important and fundamental.",
                "Coordinated sensing among secondary radios is essential due to limited device sensing resolution and physical RF effects such as shadowing.",
                "Cabric et al. [5] illustrate the gains from cooperation and show an order of magnitude reduction in the probability of interference with the primary user when only a small fraction of secondary users cooperate.",
                "However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.",
                "Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.",
                "This implies that both data and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a single radio interface.",
                "Therefore, any time spent communicating sensory information takes away from the devices ability to perform its intended function.",
                "Thus, any such coordination must incur minimal network overhead.",
                "Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely fashion.",
                "This is especially true due to mobility, as rapid changes of the RF environment can occur due to device and obstacle movements.",
                "Here, fading and multi-path interference heavily impact sensing abilities.",
                "Signal level can drop to a deep null with just a λ/4 movement in receiver position (3.7 cm at 2 GHz), where λ is the wavelength [14].",
                "Coordination which does not support rapid dissemination of information will not be able to account for such RF variations.",
                "Large Sensory Data: Because cognitive radios can potentially use any part of the <br>rf spectrum</br>, there will be numerous channels that they need to scan.",
                "Suppose we wish to compute the average signal energy in each of 100 discretized frequency bands, and each signal can have up to 128 discrete energy levels.",
                "Exchanging complete sensory information between nodes would require 700 bits per transmission (for 100 channels, each requiring seven bits of information).",
                "Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate network bandwidth.",
                "Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation.",
                "By applying gossip and FM aggregation, aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to (c·logN time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 0.40 Mbps, since 12 time-steps are needed to propagate the data (with c = 2, for illustrative purpoes1 ).",
                "This is explained further in Section 4.",
                "Based on these insights, we propose GUESS, a low-overhead approach which uses incremental extensions to FM aggregation and randomized gossiping for efficient coordination within a cognitive radio network.",
                "As we show in Section 7, 1 Convergence time is correlated with the connectivity topology of the devices, which in turn depends on the environment. 13 X A A X B B X Figure 2: Using FM aggregation to compute average signal level measured by a group of devices. these incremental extensions can further reduce bandwidth requirements by up to a factor of 2.4 over the standard approaches discussed above. 3.",
                "RELATED WORK Research in cognitive radio has increased rapidly [4, 17] over the years, and it is being projected as one of the leading enabling technologies for wireless networks of the future [9].",
                "As mentioned earlier, the FCC has already identified new regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed in the literature to support such sharing [4, 17].",
                "Detecting the presence of a primary user is non-trivial, especially a legacy primary user that is not cognitive radio aware.",
                "Secondary users must be able to detect the primary even if they cannot properly decode its signals.",
                "This has been shown by Sahai et al. [16] to be extremely difficult even if the modulation scheme is known.",
                "Sophisticated and costly hardware, beyond a simple energy detector, is required to improve signal detection accuracy [16].",
                "Moreover, a shadowed secondary user may not even be able to detect signals from the primary.",
                "As a result, simple local sensing approaches have not gained much momentum.",
                "This has motivated the need for cooperation among cognitive radios [16].",
                "More recently, some researchers have proposed approaches for radio coordination.",
                "Liu et al. [11] consider a centralized access point (or base station) architecture in which sensing information is forwarded to APs for spectrum allocation purposes.",
                "APs direct mobile clients to collect such sensing information on their behalf.",
                "However, due to the need of a fixed AP infrastructure, such a centralized approach is clearly not scalable.",
                "In other work, Zhao et al. [17] propose a distributed coordination approach for spectrum sensing and allocation.",
                "Cognitive radios organize into clusters and coordination occurs within clusters.",
                "The CORVUS [4] architecture proposes a similar clustering method that can use either a centralized or decentralized approach to manage clusters.",
                "Although an improvement over purely centralized approaches, these techniques still require a setup phase to generate the clusters, which not only adds additional delay, but also requires many of the secondary users to be static or quasi-static.",
                "In contrast, GUESS does not place such restrictions on secondary users, and can even function in highly mobile environments. 4.",
                "BACKGROUND This section provides the background for our approach.",
                "We present the FM aggregation scheme that we use to generate spectrum summaries and perform in-network aggregation.",
                "We also discuss randomized gossiping techniques for disseminating aggregates in a cognitive radio network. 4.1 FM Aggregation Aggregation is the process where nodes in a distributed network combine data received from neighboring nodes with their local value to generate a combined aggregate.",
                "This aggregate is then communicated to other nodes in the network and this process repeats until the aggregate at all nodes has converged to the same value, i.e. the global aggregate.",
                "Double-counting is a well known problem in this process, where nodes may contribute more than once to the aggregate, causing inaccuracy in the final result.",
                "Intuitively, nodes can tag the aggregate value they transmit with information about which nodes have contributed to it.",
                "However, this approach is not scalable.",
                "Order and Duplicate Insensitive (ODI) techniques have been proposed in the literature [10, 15].",
                "We adopt the ODI approach pioneered by Flajolet and Martin (FM) for the purposes of aggregation.",
                "Next we outline the FM approach; for full details, see [7].",
                "Suppose we want to compute the number of nodes in the network, i.e. the COUNT query.",
                "To do so, each node performs a coin toss experiment as follows: toss an unbiased coin, stopping after the first head is seen.",
                "The node then sets the ith bit in a bit vector (initially filled with zeros), where i is the number of coin tosses it performed.",
                "The intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss experiments increases, the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes bit vectors increases.",
                "These bit vectors are then exchanged among nodes.",
                "When a node receives a bit vector, it updates its local bit vector by bitwise OR-ing it with the received vector (as shown in Figure 2 which computes AVERAGE).",
                "At the end of the aggregation process, every node, with high probability, has the same bit vector.",
                "The actual value of the count aggregate is then computed using the following formula, AGGF M = 2j−1 /0.77351, where j represents the bit position of the least significant zero in the aggregate bit vector [7].",
                "Although such aggregates are very compact in nature, requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%.",
                "More accurate aggregates can be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each node, as explained in [7].",
                "This decreases the error to within O(1/ √ m), where m is the number of such bit vectors.",
                "Queries other than count can also be computed using variants of this basic counting algorithm, as discussed in [3] (and shown in Figure 2).",
                "Transmitting FM bit vectors between nodes is done using randomized gossiping, discussed next. 4.2 Gossip Protocols Gossip-based protocols operate in discrete time-steps; a time-step is the required amount of time for all transmissions in that time-step to complete.",
                "At every time-step, each node having something to send randomly selects one or more neighboring nodes and transmits its data to them.",
                "The randomized propagation of information provides fault-tolerance and resilience to network failures and outages.",
                "We emphasize that this characteristic of the protocol also allows it to operate without relying on any underlying network structure.",
                "Gossip protocols have been shown to provide exponentially fast convergence2 , on the order of O(log N) [10], where N is the number of nodes (or radios).",
                "These protocols can therefore easily scale to very dense environments. 2 Convergence refers to the state in which all nodes have the most up-to-date view of the network. 14 Two types of gossip protocols are: • Uniform Gossip: In uniform gossip, at each timestep, each node chooses a random neighbor and sends its data to it.",
                "This process repeats for O(log(N)) steps (where N is the number of nodes in the network).",
                "Uniform gossip provides exponentially fast convergence, with low network overhead [10]. • Random Walk: In random walk, only a subset of the nodes (termed designated nodes) communicate in a particular time-step.",
                "At startup, k nodes are randomly elected as designated nodes.",
                "In each time-step, each designated node sends its data to a random neighbor, which becomes designated for the subsequent timestep (much like passing a token).",

                "Now suppose that the measured signal at a node changes from s to s .",
                "The vectors are updated as follows. • s > s: We simply perform (s − s) more coin toss experiments and bitwise OR the result with the original bit vector. • s < s: We increase the value of the delete vector by performing (s − s ) coin toss experiments and bitwise OR the result with the current delete vector.",
                "Using delete vectors, we can now support updates to the measured signal level.",
                "With the original implementation of FM, the aggregate would need to be discarded and a new one recomputed every time an update occurred.",

                "Section 3 discusses related work in the area, while Section 4 provides a background on in-network aggregation and randomized gossiping.",
                "Sections 5 and 6 discuss extensions and protocol details of these techniques for coordinated spectrum sensing.",
                "Section 7 presents simulation results showcasing the benefits of GUESS, and Section 8 presents a discussion and some directions for future work. 2.",
                "MOTIVATION To estimate the scale of the problem, In-stat predicts that the number of WiFi-enabled devices sold annually alone will grow to 430 million by 2009 [2].",
                "Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that a typical dense urban environment will contain several thousand <br>cognitive radio</br> devices in range of each other.",
                "As a result, distributed spectrum sensing and allocation would become both important and fundamental.",
                "Coordinated sensing among secondary radios is essential due to limited device sensing resolution and physical RF effects such as shadowing.",
                "Cabric et al. [5] illustrate the gains from cooperation and show an order of magnitude reduction in the probability of interference with the primary user when only a small fraction of secondary users cooperate.",
                "However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.",
                "Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.",
                "This implies that both data and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a single radio interface.",
                "Therefore, any time spent communicating sensory information takes away from the devices ability to perform its intended function.",
                "Thus, any such coordination must incur minimal network overhead.",
                "Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely fashion.",
                "This is especially true due to mobility, as rapid changes of the RF environment can occur due to device and obstacle movements.",
                "Here, fading and multi-path interference heavily impact sensing abilities.",
                "Signal level can drop to a deep null with just a λ/4 movement in receiver position (3.7 cm at 2 GHz), where λ is the wavelength [14].",
                "Coordination which does not support rapid dissemination of information will not be able to account for such RF variations.",
                "Large Sensory Data: Because cognitive radios can potentially use any part of the RF spectrum, there will be numerous channels that they need to scan.",
                "Suppose we wish to compute the average signal energy in each of 100 discretized frequency bands, and each signal can have up to 128 discrete energy levels.",
                "Exchanging complete sensory information between nodes would require 700 bits per transmission (for 100 channels, each requiring seven bits of information).",
                "Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate network bandwidth.",
                "Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation.",
                "By applying gossip and FM aggregation, aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to (c·logN time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 0.40 Mbps, since 12 time-steps are needed to propagate the data (with c = 2, for illustrative purpoes1 ).",
                "This is explained further in Section 4.",
                "Based on these insights, we propose GUESS, a low-overhead approach which uses incremental extensions to FM aggregation and randomized gossiping for efficient coordination within a <br>cognitive radio</br> network.",

                "RELATED WORK Research in <br>cognitive radio</br> has increased rapidly [4, 17] over the years, and it is being projected as one of the leading enabling technologies for wireless networks of the future [9].",
                "As mentioned earlier, the FCC has already identified new regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed in the literature to support such sharing [4, 17].",
                "Detecting the presence of a primary user is non-trivial, especially a legacy primary user that is not <br>cognitive radio</br> aware.",
                "Secondary users must be able to detect the primary even if they cannot properly decode its signals.",
                "This has been shown by Sahai et al. [16] to be extremely difficult even if the modulation scheme is known.",
                "Sophisticated and costly hardware, beyond a simple energy detector, is required to improve signal detection accuracy [16].",
                "Moreover, a shadowed secondary user may not even be able to detect signals from the primary.",
                "As a result, simple local sensing approaches have not gained much momentum.",
                "This has motivated the need for cooperation among cognitive radios [16].",
                "More recently, some researchers have proposed approaches for radio coordination.",
                "Liu et al. [11] consider a centralized access point (or base station) architecture in which sensing information is forwarded to APs for spectrum allocation purposes.",
                "APs direct mobile clients to collect such sensing information on their behalf.",
                "However, due to the need of a fixed AP infrastructure, such a centralized approach is clearly not scalable.",
                "In other work, Zhao et al. [17] propose a distributed coordination approach for spectrum sensing and allocation.",
                "Cognitive radios organize into clusters and coordination occurs within clusters.",
                "The CORVUS [4] architecture proposes a similar clustering method that can use either a centralized or decentralized approach to manage clusters.",
                "Although an improvement over purely centralized approaches, these techniques still require a setup phase to generate the clusters, which not only adds additional delay, but also requires many of the secondary users to be static or quasi-static.",
                "In contrast, GUESS does not place such restrictions on secondary users, and can even function in highly mobile environments. 4.",
                "BACKGROUND This section provides the background for our approach.",
                "We present the FM aggregation scheme that we use to generate spectrum summaries and perform in-network aggregation.",
                "We also discuss randomized gossiping techniques for disseminating aggregates in a <br>cognitive radio</br> network. 4.1 FM Aggregation Aggregation is the process where nodes in a distributed network combine data received from neighboring nodes with their local value to generate a combined aggregate.",
                "This aggregate is then communicated to other nodes in the network and this process repeats until the aggregate at all nodes has converged to the same value, i.e. the global aggregate.",
                "Double-counting is a well known problem in this process, where nodes may contribute more than once to the aggregate, causing inaccuracy in the final result.",
                "Intuitively, nodes can tag the aggregate value they transmit with information about which nodes have contributed to it.",
                "However, this approach is not scalable.",
                "Order and Duplicate Insensitive (ODI) techniques have been proposed in the literature [10, 15].",
                "We adopt the ODI approach pioneered by Flajolet and Martin (FM) for the purposes of aggregation.",
                "Next we outline the FM approach; for full details, see [7].",
                "Suppose we want to compute the number of nodes in the network, i.e. the COUNT query.",
                "To do so, each node performs a coin toss experiment as follows: toss an unbiased coin, stopping after the first head is seen.",
                "The node then sets the ith bit in a bit vector (initially filled with zeros), where i is the number of coin tosses it performed.",
                "The intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss experiments increases, the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes bit vectors increases.",
                "These bit vectors are then exchanged among nodes.",
                "When a node receives a bit vector, it updates its local bit vector by bitwise OR-ing it with the received vector (as shown in Figure 2 which computes AVERAGE).",
                "At the end of the aggregation process, every node, with high probability, has the same bit vector.",
                "The actual value of the count aggregate is then computed using the following formula, AGGF M = 2j−1 /0.77351, where j represents the bit position of the least significant zero in the aggregate bit vector [7].",
                "Although such aggregates are very compact in nature, requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%.",
                "More accurate aggregates can be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each node, as explained in [7].",
                "This decreases the error to within O(1/ √ m), where m is the number of such bit vectors.",
                "Queries other than count can also be computed using variants of this basic counting algorithm, as discussed in [3] (and shown in Figure 2).",
                "Transmitting FM bit vectors between nodes is done using randomized gossiping, discussed next. 4.2 Gossip Protocols Gossip-based protocols operate in discrete time-steps; a time-step is the required amount of time for all transmissions in that time-step to complete.",
                "At every time-step, each node having something to send randomly selects one or more neighboring nodes and transmits its data to them.",
                "The randomized propagation of information provides fault-tolerance and resilience to network failures and outages.",
                "We emphasize that this characteristic of the protocol also allows it to operate without relying on any underlying network structure.",
                "Gossip protocols have been shown to provide exponentially fast convergence2 , on the order of O(log N) [10], where N is the number of nodes (or radios).",
                "These protocols can therefore easily scale to very dense environments. 2 Convergence refers to the state in which all nodes have the most up-to-date view of the network. 14 Two types of gossip protocols are: • Uniform Gossip: In uniform gossip, at each timestep, each node chooses a random neighbor and sends its data to it.",
                "This process repeats for O(log(N)) steps (where N is the number of nodes in the network).",
                "Uniform gossip provides exponentially fast convergence, with low network overhead [10]. • Random Walk: In random walk, only a subset of the nodes (termed designated nodes) communicate in a particular time-step.",
                "At startup, k nodes are randomly elected as designated nodes.",
                "In each time-step, each designated node sends its data to a random neighbor, which becomes designated for the subsequent timestep (much like passing a token).",
                "This process repeats until the aggregate has converged in the network.",
                "Random walk has been shown to provide similar convergence bounds as uniform gossip in problems of similar context [8, 12]. 5.",
                "INCREMENTAL PROTOCOLS 5.1 Incremental FM Aggregates One limitation of FM aggregation is that it does not support updates.",
                "Due to the probabilistic nature of FM, once bit vectors have been ORed together, information cannot simply be removed from them as each nodes contribution has not been recorded.",
                "We propose the use of delete vectors, an extension of FM to support updates.",

                "To compute this, we compute the SUM of all signal level measurements and divide that by the COUNT of the number of measurements.",
                "A SUM aggregate is computed similar to COUNT (explained in Section 4.1), except that each node performs s coin toss experiments, where s is the locally measured signal level.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the sequence by which the average signal energy is computed in a particular band using FM aggregation.",
                "Now suppose that the measured signal at a node changes from s to s .",
                "The vectors are updated as follows. • s > s: We simply perform (s − s) more coin toss experiments and bitwise OR the result with the original bit vector. • s < s: We increase the value of the delete vector by performing (s − s ) coin toss experiments and bitwise OR the result with the current delete vector.",
                "Using delete vectors, we can now support updates to the measured signal level.",
                "With the original implementation of FM, the aggregate would need to be discarded and a new one recomputed every time an update occurred.",
                "Thus, delete vectors provide a low overhead alternative for applications whose data changes incrementally, such as signal level measurements in a coordinated spectrum sensing environment.",
                "Next we discuss how these aggregates can be communicated between devices using incremental routing protocols. 5.2 Incremental Routing Protocol We use the following incremental variants of the routing protocols presented in Section 4.2 to support incremental updates to previously computed aggregates.",

                "Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.",

                "Thus, any such coordination must incur minimal network overhead.",
                "Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely fashion.",

                "Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate network bandwidth.",

                "RF spectrum changes incrementally: On most bands, RF spectrum utilization changes infrequently.",
                "Moreover, utilization of a specific RF band affects only that band and not the entire spectrum.",
                "Therefore, if the usage pattern of a particular band changes substantially, nodes detecting that change can initiate an update protocol to update the information for that band alone, leaving in place information already collected for other bands.",

                "However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.",
                "Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.",
                "This implies that both data and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a single radio interface.",
                "Therefore, any time spent communicating sensory information takes away from the devices ability to perform its intended function.",
                "Thus, any such coordination must incur minimal network overhead.",
                "Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely fashion.",
                "This is especially true due to mobility, as rapid changes of the RF environment can occur due to device and obstacle movements.",

                "Exchanging complete sensory information between nodes would require 700 bits per transmission (for 100 channels, each requiring seven bits of information).",
                "Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate network bandwidth.",
                "Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation.",
                "By applying gossip and FM aggregation, aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to (c·logN time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 0.40 Mbps, since 12 time-steps are needed to propagate the data (with c = 2, for illustrative purpoes1 ).",
                "This is explained further in Section 4.",

                "Sophisticated and costly hardware, beyond a simple energy detector, is required to improve signal detection accuracy [16].",
                "Moreover, a shadowed secondary user may not even be able to detect signals from the primary.",

                "This has motivated the need for cooperation among cognitive radios [16].",

                "APs direct mobile clients to collect such sensing information on their behalf.",
                "However, due to the need of a fixed AP infrastructure, such a centralized approach is clearly not scalable.",
                "In other work, Zhao et al. [17] propose a distributed coordination approach for spectrum sensing and allocation.",
                "Cognitive radios organize into clusters and coordination occurs within clusters.",

                "We also discuss randomized gossiping techniques for disseminating aggregates in a cognitive radio network. 4.1 FM Aggregation Aggregation is the process where nodes in a distributed network combine data received from neighboring nodes with their local value to generate a combined aggregate.",
                "This aggregate is then communicated to other nodes in the network and this process repeats until the aggregate at all nodes has converged to the same value, i.e. the global aggregate.",
                "Double-counting is a well known problem in this process, where nodes may contribute more than once to the aggregate, causing inaccuracy in the final result.",
                "Intuitively, nodes can tag the aggregate value they transmit with information about which nodes have contributed to it.",
                "However, this approach is not scalable.",
                "Order and Duplicate Insensitive (ODI) techniques have been proposed in the literature [10, 15].",
                "We adopt the ODI approach pioneered by Flajolet and Martin (FM) for the purposes of aggregation.",
                "Next we outline the FM approach; for full details, see [7].",
                "Suppose we want to compute the number of nodes in the network, i.e. the COUNT query.",
                "To do so, each node performs a coin toss experiment as follows: toss an unbiased coin, stopping after the first head is seen.",
                "The node then sets the ith bit in a bit vector (initially filled with zeros), where i is the number of coin tosses it performed.",
                "The intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss experiments increases, the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes bit vectors increases.",
                "These bit vectors are then exchanged among nodes.",
                "When a node receives a bit vector, it updates its local bit vector by bitwise OR-ing it with the received vector (as shown in Figure 2 which computes AVERAGE).",
                "At the end of the aggregation process, every node, with high probability, has the same bit vector.",
                "The actual value of the count aggregate is then computed using the following formula, AGGF M = 2j−1 /0.77351, where j represents the bit position of the least significant zero in the aggregate bit vector [7].",
                "Although such aggregates are very compact in nature, requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%.",
                "More accurate aggregates can be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each node, as explained in [7].",
                "This decreases the error to within O(1/ √ m), where m is the number of such bit vectors.",
                "Queries other than count can also be computed using variants of this basic counting algorithm, as discussed in [3] (and shown in Figure 2).",
                "Transmitting FM bit vectors between nodes is done using randomized gossiping, discussed next. 4.2 Gossip Protocols Gossip-based protocols operate in discrete time-steps; a time-step is the required amount of time for all transmissions in that time-step to complete.",

                "These protocols can therefore easily scale to very dense environments. 2 Convergence refers to the state in which all nodes have the most up-to-date view of the network. 14 Two types of gossip protocols are: • Uniform Gossip: In uniform gossip, at each timestep, each node chooses a random neighbor and sends its data to it.",
                "This process repeats for O(log(N)) steps (where N is the number of nodes in the network).",
                "Uniform gossip provides exponentially fast convergence, with low network overhead [10]. • Random Walk: In random walk, only a subset of the nodes (termed designated nodes) communicate in a particular time-step.",
                "At startup, k nodes are randomly elected as designated nodes.",
                "In each time-step, each designated node sends its data to a random neighbor, which becomes designated for the subsequent timestep (much like passing a token).",

                "Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.",
                "This implies that both data and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a single radio interface.",
                "Therefore, any time spent communicating sensory information takes away from the devices ability to perform its intended function.",
                "Thus, any such coordination must incur minimal network overhead.",
                "Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely fashion.",
                "This is especially true due to mobility, as rapid changes of the RF environment can occur due to device and obstacle movements.",

                "Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate network bandwidth.",
                "Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation.",
                "By applying gossip and FM aggregation, aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to (c·logN time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 0.40 Mbps, since 12 time-steps are needed to propagate the data (with c = 2, for illustrative purpoes1 ).",

                "Next we outline the FM approach; for full details, see [7].",
                "Suppose we want to compute the number of nodes in the network, i.e. the COUNT query.",
                "To do so, each node performs a coin toss experiment as follows: toss an unbiased coin, stopping after the first head is seen.",
                "The node then sets the ith bit in a bit vector (initially filled with zeros), where i is the number of coin tosses it performed.",
                "The intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss experiments increases, the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes bit vectors increases.",
                "These bit vectors are then exchanged among nodes.",
                "When a node receives a bit vector, it updates its local bit vector by bitwise OR-ing it with the received vector (as shown in Figure 2 which computes AVERAGE).",

                "Although such aggregates are very compact in nature, requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%.",
                "More accurate aggregates can be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each node, as explained in [7].",

                "Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.",
                "This implies that both data and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a single radio interface.",
                "Therefore, any time spent communicating sensory information takes away from the devices ability to perform its intended function.",

                "The intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss experiments increases, the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes bit vectors increases.",

                "Although such aggregates are very compact in nature, requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%.",

                "Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.",

                "Next we outline the FM approach; for full details, see [7].",
                "Suppose we want to compute the number of nodes in the network, i.e. the COUNT query.",

                "The node then sets the ith bit in a bit vector (initially filled with zeros), where i is the number of coin tosses it performed.",
                "The intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss experiments increases, the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes bit vectors increases.",
                "These bit vectors are then exchanged among nodes.",
                "When a node receives a bit vector, it updates its local bit vector by bitwise OR-ing it with the received vector (as shown in Figure 2 which computes AVERAGE).",

                "The actual value of the count aggregate is then computed using the following formula, AGGF M = 2j−1 /0.77351, where j represents the bit position of the least significant zero in the aggregate bit vector [7].",
                "Although such aggregates are very compact in nature, requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%.",
                "More accurate aggregates can be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each node, as explained in [7].",

                "However, this has come at the cost of increased RF interference, which has caused the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States to re-evaluate its strategy on spectrum allocation.",
                "Currently, the FCC has licensed RF spectrum to a variety of public and private institutions, termed primary users.",
                "New spectrum allocation regimes implemented by the FCC use dynamic spectrum access schemes to either negotiate or opportunistically allocate RF spectrum to unlicensed secondary users Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.",

                "The second type of allocation scheme is termed opportunistic spectrum sharing.",
                "The FCC has already legislated this access method for the 5 GHz band and is also considering the same for TV broadcast bands [1].",
                "As a result, a new wave of intelligent radios, termed cognitive radios (or software defined radios), is emerging that can dynamically re-tune their radio parameters based on interactions with their surrounding environment.",
                "Under the new opportunistic allocation strategy, secondary users are obligated not to interfere with primary users (senders or receivers).",
                "This can be done by sensing the environment to detect the presence of primary users.",
                "However, local sensing is not always adequate, especially in cases where a secondary user is shadowed from a primary user, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
                "Here, coordination between secondary users is the only way for shadowed users to detect the primary.",
                "In general, cooperation improves sensing accuracy by an order of magnitude when compared to not cooperating at all [5].",
                "To realize this vision of dynamic spectrum access, two fundamental problems must be solved: (1) Efficient and coordinated spectrum sensing and (2) Distributed spectrum allocation.",
                "In this paper, we propose strategies for coordinated spectrum sensing that are low cost, operate on timescales comparable to the agility of the RF environment, and are resilient to network failures and alterations.",
                "We defer the problem of spectrum allocation to future work.",
                "Spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio networks [4, 17] are broadly classified into three regimes; (1) centralized coordinated techniques, (2) decentralized coordinated techniques, and (3) decentralized uncoordinated techniques.",
                "We advocate a decentralized coordinated approach, similar in spirit to OSPF link-state routing used in the Internet.",
                "This is more effective than uncoordinated approaches because making decisions based only on local information is fallible (as shown in Figure 1).",
                "Moreover, compared to cen12 tralized approaches, decentralized techniques are more scalable, robust, and resistant to network failures and security attacks (e.g. jamming).",
                "Coordinating sensory data between cognitive radio devices is technically challenging because accurately assessing spectrum usage requires exchanging potentially large amounts of data with many radios at very short time scales.",
                "Data size grows rapidly due to the large number (i.e. thousands) of spectrum bands that must be scanned.",
                "This data must also be exchanged between potentially hundreds of neighboring secondary users at short time scales, to account for rapid changes in the RF environment.",
                "This paper presents GUESS, a novel approach to coordinated spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks.",
                "Our approach is motivated by the following key observations: 1.",
                "Low-cost sensors collect approximate data: Most devices have limited sensing resolution because they are low-cost and low duty-cycle devices and thus cannot perform complex RF signal processing (e.g. matched filtering).",
                "Many are typically equipped with simple energy detectors that gather only approximate information. 2.",
                "Approximate summaries are sufficient for coordination: Approximate statistical summaries of sensed data are sufficient for correlating sensed information between radios, as relative usage information is more important than absolute usage data.",
                "Thus, exchanging exact RF information may not be necessary, and more importantly, too costly for the purposes of spectrum sensing. 3.",
                "RF spectrum changes incrementally: On most bands, RF spectrum utilization changes infrequently.",
                "Moreover, utilization of a specific RF band affects only that band and not the entire spectrum.",
                "Therefore, if the usage pattern of a particular band changes substantially, nodes detecting that change can initiate an update protocol to update the information for that band alone, leaving in place information already collected for other bands.",
                "This allows rapid detection of change while saving the overhead of exchanging unnecessary information.",
                "Based on these observations, GUESS makes the following contributions: 1.",
                "A novel approach that applies randomized gossiping algorithms to the problem of coordinated spectrum sensing.",
                "These algorithms are well suited to coordinated spectrum sensing due to the unique characteristics of the problem: i.e. radios are power-limited, mobile and have limited bandwidth to support spectrum sensing capabilities. 2.",
                "An application of in-network aggregation for dissemination of spectrum summaries.",
                "We argue that approximate summaries are adequate for performing accurate radio parameter tuning. 3.",
                "An extension of in-network aggregation and randomized gossiping to support incremental maintenance of spectrum summaries.",
                "Compared to standard gossiping approaches, incremental techniques can further reduce overhead and protocol execution time by requiring fewer radio resources.",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 motivates the need for a low cost and efficient approach to coordinated spectrum sensing.",
                "Section 3 discusses related work in the area, while Section 4 provides a background on in-network aggregation and randomized gossiping.",
                "Sections 5 and 6 discuss extensions and protocol details of these techniques for coordinated spectrum sensing.",
                "Section 7 presents simulation results showcasing the benefits of GUESS, and Section 8 presents a discussion and some directions for future work. 2.",
                "MOTIVATION To estimate the scale of the problem, In-stat predicts that the number of WiFi-enabled devices sold annually alone will grow to 430 million by 2009 [2].",
                "Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that a typical dense urban environment will contain several thousand cognitive radio devices in range of each other.",
                "As a result, distributed spectrum sensing and allocation would become both important and fundamental.",
                "Coordinated sensing among secondary radios is essential due to limited device sensing resolution and physical RF effects such as shadowing.",
                "Cabric et al. [5] illustrate the gains from cooperation and show an order of magnitude reduction in the probability of interference with the primary user when only a small fraction of secondary users cooperate.",
                "However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.",
                "Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.",
                "This implies that both data and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a single radio interface.",
                "Therefore, any time spent communicating sensory information takes away from the devices ability to perform its intended function.",
                "Thus, any such coordination must incur minimal network overhead.",
                "Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely fashion.",
                "This is especially true due to mobility, as rapid changes of the RF environment can occur due to device and obstacle movements.",
                "Here, fading and multi-path interference heavily impact sensing abilities.",
                "Signal level can drop to a deep null with just a λ/4 movement in receiver position (3.7 cm at 2 GHz), where λ is the wavelength [14].",
                "Coordination which does not support rapid dissemination of information will not be able to account for such RF variations.",
                "Large Sensory Data: Because cognitive radios can potentially use any part of the RF spectrum, there will be numerous channels that they need to scan.",
                "Suppose we wish to compute the average signal energy in each of 100 discretized frequency bands, and each signal can have up to 128 discrete energy levels.",
                "Exchanging complete sensory information between nodes would require 700 bits per transmission (for 100 channels, each requiring seven bits of information).",
                "Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate network bandwidth.",
                "Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation.",
                "By applying gossip and FM aggregation, aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to (c·logN time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 0.40 Mbps, since 12 time-steps are needed to propagate the data (with c = 2, for illustrative purpoes1 ).",
                "This is explained further in Section 4.",
                "Based on these insights, we propose GUESS, a low-overhead approach which uses incremental extensions to FM aggregation and randomized gossiping for efficient coordination within a cognitive radio network.",
                "As we show in Section 7, 1 Convergence time is correlated with the connectivity topology of the devices, which in turn depends on the environment. 13 X A A X B B X Figure 2: Using FM aggregation to compute average signal level measured by a group of devices. these incremental extensions can further reduce bandwidth requirements by up to a factor of 2.4 over the standard approaches discussed above. 3.",
                "RELATED WORK Research in cognitive radio has increased rapidly [4, 17] over the years, and it is being projected as one of the leading enabling technologies for wireless networks of the future [9].",
                "As mentioned earlier, the FCC has already identified new regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed in the literature to support such sharing [4, 17].",
                "Detecting the presence of a primary user is non-trivial, especially a legacy primary user that is not cognitive radio aware.",
                "Secondary users must be able to detect the primary even if they cannot properly decode its signals.",
                "This has been shown by Sahai et al. [16] to be extremely difficult even if the modulation scheme is known.",
                "Sophisticated and costly hardware, beyond a simple energy detector, is required to improve signal detection accuracy [16].",
                "Moreover, a shadowed secondary user may not even be able to detect signals from the primary.",
                "As a result, simple local sensing approaches have not gained much momentum.",
                "This has motivated the need for cooperation among cognitive radios [16].",
                "More recently, some researchers have proposed approaches for radio coordination.",
                "Liu et al. [11] consider a centralized access point (or base station) architecture in which sensing information is forwarded to APs for spectrum allocation purposes.",
                "APs direct mobile clients to collect such sensing information on their behalf.",
                "However, due to the need of a fixed AP infrastructure, such a centralized approach is clearly not scalable.",
                "In other work, Zhao et al. [17] propose a distributed coordination approach for spectrum sensing and allocation.",
                "Cognitive radios organize into clusters and coordination occurs within clusters.",
                "The CORVUS [4] architecture proposes a similar clustering method that can use either a centralized or decentralized approach to manage clusters.",
                "Although an improvement over purely centralized approaches, these techniques still require a setup phase to generate the clusters, which not only adds additional delay, but also requires many of the secondary users to be static or quasi-static.",
                "In contrast, GUESS does not place such restrictions on secondary users, and can even function in highly mobile environments. 4.",
                "BACKGROUND This section provides the background for our approach.",
                "We present the FM aggregation scheme that we use to generate spectrum summaries and perform in-network aggregation.",
                "We also discuss randomized gossiping techniques for disseminating aggregates in a cognitive radio network. 4.1 FM Aggregation Aggregation is the process where nodes in a distributed network combine data received from neighboring nodes with their local value to generate a combined aggregate.",
                "This aggregate is then communicated to other nodes in the network and this process repeats until the aggregate at all nodes has converged to the same value, i.e. the global aggregate.",
                "Double-counting is a well known problem in this process, where nodes may contribute more than once to the aggregate, causing inaccuracy in the final result.",
                "Intuitively, nodes can tag the aggregate value they transmit with information about which nodes have contributed to it.",
                "However, this approach is not scalable.",
                "Order and Duplicate Insensitive (ODI) techniques have been proposed in the literature [10, 15].",
                "We adopt the ODI approach pioneered by Flajolet and Martin (FM) for the purposes of aggregation.",
                "Next we outline the FM approach; for full details, see [7].",
                "Suppose we want to compute the number of nodes in the network, i.e. the COUNT query.",
                "To do so, each node performs a coin toss experiment as follows: toss an unbiased coin, stopping after the first head is seen.",
                "The node then sets the ith bit in a bit vector (initially filled with zeros), where i is the number of coin tosses it performed.",
                "The intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss experiments increases, the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes bit vectors increases.",
                "These bit vectors are then exchanged among nodes.",
                "When a node receives a bit vector, it updates its local bit vector by bitwise OR-ing it with the received vector (as shown in Figure 2 which computes AVERAGE).",
                "At the end of the aggregation process, every node, with high probability, has the same bit vector.",
                "The actual value of the count aggregate is then computed using the following formula, AGGF M = 2j−1 /0.77351, where j represents the bit position of the least significant zero in the aggregate bit vector [7].",
                "Although such aggregates are very compact in nature, requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%.",
                "More accurate aggregates can be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each node, as explained in [7].",
                "This decreases the error to within O(1/ √ m), where m is the number of such bit vectors.",
                "Queries other than count can also be computed using variants of this basic counting algorithm, as discussed in [3] (and shown in Figure 2).",
                "Transmitting FM bit vectors between nodes is done using randomized gossiping, discussed next. 4.2 Gossip Protocols Gossip-based protocols operate in discrete time-steps; a time-step is the required amount of time for all transmissions in that time-step to complete.",
                "At every time-step, each node having something to send randomly selects one or more neighboring nodes and transmits its data to them.",
                "The randomized propagation of information provides fault-tolerance and resilience to network failures and outages.",
                "We emphasize that this characteristic of the protocol also allows it to operate without relying on any underlying network structure.",
                "Gossip protocols have been shown to provide exponentially fast convergence2 , on the order of O(log N) [10], where N is the number of nodes (or radios).",
                "These protocols can therefore easily scale to very dense environments. 2 Convergence refers to the state in which all nodes have the most up-to-date view of the network. 14 Two types of gossip protocols are: • Uniform Gossip: In uniform gossip, at each timestep, each node chooses a random neighbor and sends its data to it.",
                "This process repeats for O(log(N)) steps (where N is the number of nodes in the network).",
                "Uniform gossip provides exponentially fast convergence, with low network overhead [10]. • Random Walk: In random walk, only a subset of the nodes (termed designated nodes) communicate in a particular time-step.",
                "At startup, k nodes are randomly elected as designated nodes.",
                "In each time-step, each designated node sends its data to a random neighbor, which becomes designated for the subsequent timestep (much like passing a token).",
                "This process repeats until the aggregate has converged in the network.",
                "Random walk has been shown to provide similar convergence bounds as uniform gossip in problems of similar context [8, 12]. 5.",
                "INCREMENTAL PROTOCOLS 5.1 Incremental FM Aggregates One limitation of FM aggregation is that it does not support updates.",
                "Due to the probabilistic nature of FM, once bit vectors have been ORed together, information cannot simply be removed from them as each nodes contribution has not been recorded.",
                "We propose the use of delete vectors, an extension of FM to support updates.",

                "AGGINC = (2a−1 /0.77351) − (2b−1 /0.77351) (1) Here, a and b represent the bit positions of the least significant zero in the original and delete bit vectors respectively.",
                "Suppose we wish to compute the average signal level detected in a particular frequency.",
                "To compute this, we compute the SUM of all signal level measurements and divide that by the COUNT of the number of measurements.",
                "A SUM aggregate is computed similar to COUNT (explained in Section 4.1), except that each node performs s coin toss experiments, where s is the locally measured signal level.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the sequence by which the average signal energy is computed in a particular band using FM aggregation.",
                "Now suppose that the measured signal at a node changes from s to s .",
                "The vectors are updated as follows. • s > s: We simply perform (s − s) more coin toss experiments and bitwise OR the result with the original bit vector. • s < s: We increase the value of the delete vector by performing (s − s ) coin toss experiments and bitwise OR the result with the current delete vector.",
                "Using delete vectors, we can now support updates to the measured signal level.",
                "With the original implementation of FM, the aggregate would need to be discarded and a new one recomputed every time an update occurred.",
                "Thus, delete vectors provide a low overhead alternative for applications whose data changes incrementally, such as signal level measurements in a coordinated spectrum sensing environment.",
                "Next we discuss how these aggregates can be communicated between devices using incremental routing protocols. 5.2 Incremental Routing Protocol We use the following incremental variants of the routing protocols presented in Section 4.2 to support incremental updates to previously computed aggregates.",

                "Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.",
                "This implies that both data and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a single radio interface.",
                "Therefore, any time spent communicating sensory information takes away from the devices ability to perform its intended function.",
                "Thus, any such coordination must incur minimal network overhead.",
                "Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely fashion.",
                "This is especially true due to mobility, as rapid changes of the RF environment can occur due to device and obstacle movements.",

                "Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate network bandwidth.",
                "Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation.",
                "By applying gossip and FM aggregation, aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to (c·logN time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 0.40 Mbps, since 12 time-steps are needed to propagate the data (with c = 2, for illustrative purpoes1 ).",

                "Next we outline the FM approach; for full details, see [7].",
                "Suppose we want to compute the number of nodes in the network, i.e. the COUNT query.",
                "To do so, each node performs a coin toss experiment as follows: toss an unbiased coin, stopping after the first head is seen.",
                "The node then sets the ith bit in a bit vector (initially filled with zeros), where i is the number of coin tosses it performed.",
                "The intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss experiments increases, the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes bit vectors increases.",
                "These bit vectors are then exchanged among nodes.",
                "When a node receives a bit vector, it updates its local bit vector by bitwise OR-ing it with the received vector (as shown in Figure 2 which computes AVERAGE).",

                "Although such aggregates are very compact in nature, requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%.",
                "More accurate aggregates can be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each node, as explained in [7].",
