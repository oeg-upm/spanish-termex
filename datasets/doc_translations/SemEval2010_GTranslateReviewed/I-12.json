Grosz School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Harvard University, Cambridge MA 02138 USA {sarned,grosz}@eecs.harvard.edu ABSTRACT This paper investigates the problem of estimating the value of probabilistic parameters needed for decision making in environments in which an agent, operating within a multi-agent system, has no a priori information about the structure of the distribution of parameter values. The agent must be able to produce estimations even when it may have made only a small number of direct observations, and thus it must be able to operate with sparse data. The paper describes a mechanism that enables the agent to significantly improve its estimation by augmenting its direct observations with those obtained by other agents with which it is coordinating. To avoid undesirable bias in relatively heterogeneous environments while effectively using relevant data to improve its estimations, the mechanism weighs the contributions of other agents observations based on a real-time estimation of the level of similarity between each of these agents and itself. The coordination autonomy module of a coordination-manager system provided an empirical setting for evaluation. Simulation-based evaluations demonstrated that the proposed mechanism outperforms estimations based exclusively on an agents own observations as well as estimations based on an unweighted aggregate of all other agents observations.

INTRODUCTION For many real-world scenarios, autonomous agents need to operate in dynamic, uncertain environments in which they have only incomplete information about the results of their actions and characteristics of other agents or people with whom they need to cooperate or collaborate. In such environments, agents can benefit from sharing information they gather, pooling their individual experiences to improve their estimations of unknown parameters required for reasoning about actions under uncertainty. This paper addresses the problem of learning the distribution of the values of a probabilistic parameter that represents a characteristic of a person who is interacting with a computer agent. The characteristic to be learned is (or is clearly related to) an important factor in the agents decision making.1 The basic setting we consider is one in which an agent accumulates observations about a specific user characteristic and uses them to produce a timely estimate of some measure that depends on that characteristics distribution. The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames. Typically, agents must make decisions in real time, concurrent with task execution, and in the midst of great uncertainty. In the remainder of this paper, we use the term fast-paced to refer to such environments. In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions. Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning. Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction. That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations. In such environments, an agents individually acquired data (its own observations) are too sparse for it to obtain good estimations in the requisite time frame. Given the no-structure-constraint of the environment, approaches that depend on structured distributions may result in a significantly high estimation bias. We consider this problem in the context of a multi-agent distributed system in which computer agents support people who are carrying out complex tasks in a dynamic environment. The fact that agents are part of a multi-agent setting, in which other agents may 1 Learning the distribution rather than just determining some value in the distribution is important whenever the overall shape of the distribution and not just such individual features as mean are important. also be gathering data to estimate a similar characteristic of their users, offers the possibility for an agent to augment its own observations with those of other agents, thus improving the accuracy of its learning process. Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate. Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given agent depends on the extent to which their users characteristics distributions are correlated with that of this agents user. There is no guarantee that the distribution for two different agents is highly, positively correlated, let alone that they are the same. Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a learning mechanism must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation. The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work. However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-agent settings in which agents are collecting data that overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets). In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual parameters they need for their decision-making. In this paper, we present a mechanism that was used for learning key user characteristics in fast-paced environments. The mechanism provides relatively accurate estimations within short time frames by augmenting an individual agents direct observations with observations obtained by other agents with which it is coordinating. In particular, we focus on the related problems of estimating the cost of interrupting a person and estimating the probability that that person will have the information required by the system. Our adaptive approach, which we will refer to throughout the paper as selective-sharing, allows our CA to improve the accuracy of its distribution-based estimations in comparison to relying only on the interactions with a specific user (subsequently, self-learning) or pooling all data unconditionally (average all), in particular when the number of available observations is relatively small. The mechanism was successfully tested using a system that simulates a Coordinators environment. The next section of the paper describes the problem of estimating user-related parameters in fastpaced domains. Section 3 provides an overview of the methods we developed. The implementation, empirical setting, and results are given in Sections 4 and 5. A comparison with related methods is given in Section 6 and conclusions in section 7. 2. PARAMETER ESTIMATION IN FASTPACED DOMAINS The CA module and algorithms we describe in this paper were developed and tested in the Coordinators domain [21]. In this domain, autonomous agents, called Coordinators, are intended to help maximize an overall team objective by handling changes in the task schedule as conditions of operation change. Each agent operates on behalf of its owner (e.g., the team leader of a firstresponse team or a unit commander) whose schedule it manages. Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by owners or by units they oversee, and the agents responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners). In this domain, scheduling information and constraints are distributed. Each agent receives a different view of the tasks and structures that constitute the full multi-agent problem-typically only a partial, local one. Schedule revisions that affect more than one agent must be coordinated, so agents thus must share certain kinds of information. (In a team context they may be designed to share other types as well.) However, the fast-paced nature of the domain constrains the amount of information they can share, precluding a centralized solution; scheduling problems must be solved distributively. The agent-owner relationship is a collaborative one, with the agent needing to interact with its owner to obtain task and environment information relevant to scheduling. The CA module is responsible for deciding intelligently when and how to interact with the owner for improving the agents scheduling. As a result, the CA must estimate the expected benefit of any such interaction and the cost associated with it [19]. In general, the net benefit of a potential interaction is PV − C, where V is the value of the information the user may have, P is the probability that the user has this information, and C is the cost associated with an interaction. The values of P, V , and C are time-varying, and the CA estimates their value at the intended time of initiating the interaction with its owner. This paper focuses on the twin problems of estimating the parameters P and C, both of which are user-centric in the sense of being determined by characteristics of the owner and the environment in which the owner is operating); it presumes a mechanism for determining V [18]. 2.1 Estimating Interruption Costs The cost of interrupting owners derives from the potential degradation in performance of tasks they are doing caused by the disruption [1; 9, inter alia]. Research on interaction management has deployed sensor-based statistical models of human interruptibility to infer the degree of distraction likely to be caused by an interruption. This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying interruptions to times that are convenient. It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a users current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions. By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the users attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a users attention and intentions [9]. Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5]. Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions. First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider. Second, the interruptibility-estimation models are task-based. Lastly, it relies on continuous monitoring of a users activities. In fast-paced environments, there usually is no single task structure, and some of the activities themselves may have little internal structure. As a result, it is difficult to determine the actual attentional state of agent-owners [15]. In such settings, owners must make complex decisions that typically involve a number of other members of their units, while remaining reactive to events that diverge from expectations [24]. For instance, during disaster rescue, a first-response unit may begin rescuing survivors trapped in a burning house, when a wall collapses suddenly, forcing the unit to The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 203 retract and re-plan their actions. Prior work has tracked users focus of attention using a range of devices, including those able to monitor gestures [8] and track eyegaze to identify focus of visual attention [13, 20], thus enabling estimations of cognitive load and physical indicators of performance degradation. The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors. However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited. Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis. Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function. Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings. The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem. The CAs cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owners interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized. In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or maximize expected utility. The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function. We use a sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages. The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn. In particular, we consider the situation in which an agents owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x). The agent can activate sensing devices to get an estimation of the interruption cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of operating the sensing devices for a single time unit. The CA module sets a reservation value and as long as the sensor-based observation x is greater than this reservation value, the CA will wait and re-sample the user for a new estimation. The expected cost, V (xrv), using such a strategy with reservation value xrv is described by Equation 1, V (xrv) = c + R xrv y=0 yf(y) F(xrv) , (1) which decomposes into two parts. The first part, c divided by F(xrv), represents the expected sampling cost. The second, the integral divided by F(xrv), represents the expected cost of interruption, because the expected number of search cycles is (random) geometric and the probability of success is F(xrv). Taking the derivative of the left-hand-side of Equation 1 and equating it to zero, yields the characteristics of the optimal reservation value, namely x∗ rv must satisfy, V (x∗ rv) = x∗ rv. (2) Substituting (2) in Equation 1 yields Equation 3 (after integration by parts) from which the optimal reservation value, x∗ rv, and consequently (from Equation 2) V (x∗ rv) can be computed. c = Z x∗ rv y=0 F(y) (3) This method, which depends on extracting the optimal sequence of sensor-based user sampling, relies heavily on the structure of the distribution function, f(x). However, we need only a portion of the distribution function, namely from the origin to the reservation value. (See Equation 1 and Figure 1.) Thus, when we consider sharing data, it is not necessary to rely on complete similarity in the distribution function of different users. For some parameters, including the users interruptibility level, it is enough to rely on similarity in the relevant portion of the distribution function. The implementation described in Sections 4-5 relies on this fact. Figure 1: The distribution structure affecting the expected costs calculation 2.2 Estimating the Probability of Having Information One way an agent can estimate the probability a user will have information it needs (e.g., will know at a specific interruption time, with some level of reliability, the actual outcome of a task currently being executed) is to rely on prior interactions with this user, calculating the ratio between the number of times the user had the information and the total number of interactions. Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption. This indirect approach, which does not require interrupting the user, is especially useful in fast-paced domains. The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method: ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information. For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24]. Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information. Given occasional updates about its owners level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs. Denoting the probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy. (4) 204 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The more observations an agent can accumulate about the distribution of the frequency of an owners interaction with the environment at a given time, the better it can estimate the probability the owner has the information needed by the system. 3. THE SELECTIVE-SHARING MECHANISM This section presents the selective-sharing mechanism by which the CA learns the distribution function of a probabilistic parameter by taking advantage of data collected by other CAs in its environment. We first explain the need for increasing the number of observations used as the basis of estimation and then present a method for determining how much data to adopt from other agents. The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point. Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy). The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations. For example, Figure 2 illustrates the reservation-value-based cost calculated according to observations received from an owner with a uniform interruption cost distribution U(0, 100) as a function of the number of accumulated observations used for generating the distribution histogram. (In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5). Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function. Eventually this method yields a very accurate estimation for the expected interruption cost. However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value. This error could seriously degrade the CAs decision making process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions. Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains. One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents. Such an approach depends on identifying other owners with distribution functions for the characteristic of interest similar to the CAs owner. This dataaugmentation idea is simple: different owners may exhibit similar basic behaviors or patterns in similar fast-paced task scenarios. Since they are all coordinating on a common overall task and are operating in the same environment, it is reasonable to assume some level of similarity in the distribution function of their modeled parameters. People vary in their behavior, so, obviously, there may be different types of owners: some will emphasize communication with their teams, and some will spend more time on map-based planning; some will dislike being disturbed while trying to evaluate their teams progress, while others may be more open to interruptions. Consequently, an owners CA is likely to be able to find some CAs that are working with owners who are similar to its owner. When adopting data collected by other agents, the two main questions are which agents the CA should rely on and to what extent it should rely on each of them. The selective-sharing mechanism relies on a statistical measure of similarity that allows the CA of any specific user to identify the similarity between its owner and other owners dynamically. Based on this similarity level, the CA decides if and to what degree to import other CAs data in order to augment its direct observations, and thus to enable better modeling of its owners characteristics. It is notable that the cost of transferring observations between different CA modules of different agents is relatively small. This information can be transferred as part of regular negotiation communication between agents. The volume of such communication is negligible: it involves just the transmission of new observations values. In our learning mechanism, the CA constantly updates its estimation of the level of similarity between its owner and the owners represented by other CAs in the environment. Each new observation obtained either by that CA or any of the other CAs updates this estimation. The similarity level is determined using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Subsection 3.1). Whenever it is necessary to produce a parameter estimate, the CA decides on the number of additional observations it intends to rely on for extracting its estimation. The number of additional observations to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the similarity between its owner and other owners. In most cases, the number of observations the CA will want to take from another agent is smaller than the overall number of observations the other agent has; thus, it randomly samples (without repetitions) the required number of observations from this other agents database. The additional observations the CA takes from other agents are used only to model its owners characteristics. Future similarity level determination is not affected by this information augmentation procedure. 3.1 The Wilcoxon Test We use a nonparametric method (i.e., one that makes no assumptions about the parametric form of the distributions each set is drawn from), because user characteristics in fast-paced domains do not have the structure needed for parametric approaches. Two additional advantages of a non-parametric approach are their usefulness for dealing with unexpected, outlying observations (possibly problematic for a parametric approach), and the fact that non-parametric approaches are computationally very simple and thus ideal for settings in which computational resources are scarce. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test we use is a nonparametric alternative to the two-sample t-test [22, 14]2 . While the t-test compares means, the Wilcoxon test can be used to test the null hypothesis that two populations X and Y have the same continuous distribution. We assume that we have independent random samples {x1, x2, ..., xm} and {y1, y2, ..., yn}, of sizes m and n respectively, from each population. We then merge the data and rank each measurement from lowest to highest. All sequences of ties are assigned an average rank. From the sum of the ranks of the smaller 2 Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test is for a single sample and thus not suitable. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 205 sample, we calculate the test statistic and extract the level of confidence for rejecting the null hypothesis. This level of confidence becomes the measure for the level of similarity between the two owners. The Wilcoxon test does not require that the data originates from a normally distributed population or that the distribution is characterized by a finite set of parameters. 3.2 Determining Required Information Correctly identifying the right number of additional observations to gather is a key determinant of success of the selective-sharing mechanism. Obviously, if the CA can identify another owner who has identical characteristics to the owner it represents, then it should use all of the observations collected by that owners agent. However, cases of identical matches are likely to be very uncommon. Furthermore, even to establish that another user is identical to its own, the CA would need substantial sample sizes to have a relatively high level of confidence. Thus, usually the CA needs to decide how much to rely on another agents data while estimating various levels of similarity with a changing level of confidence. At the beginning of its process, the selective-sharing mechanism has almost no data to rely on, and thus no similarity measure can be used. In this case, the CA module relies heavily on other agents, in the expectation that all owners have some basic level of similarity in their distribution (see Section 2). As the number of its direct observations increases, the CA module refines the number of additional observations required. Again, there are two conflicting effects. On one hand, the more data the CA has, the better it can determine its level of confidence in the similarity ratings it has for other owners. On the other hand, assuming there is some difference among owners (even if not noticed yet), as the number of its direct observations increases, the owners own data should gain weight in its analysis. Therefore, when CAi decides how many additional observations, Oi j should be adopted from CAjs database, it calculates Oi j as follows: Oi j = N ∗ (1 − αi,j) √ N + 2 + ln(N) N (5) where N is the number of observations CAi already has (which is similar in magnitude to the number of observations CAj has) and αi,j is the confidence of rejecting the Wilcoxon null hypothesis. The function in Equation 5 ensures that the number of additional observations to be taken from another CA module increases as the confidence in the similarity with the source for these additional observations increases. At the same time, it ensures that the level of dependency on external observations decreases as the number of direct observations increases. When calculating the parameter αi,j, we always perform the test over the interval relevant to the originating CAs distribution function. For example, when estimating the cost of interrupting the user, we apply the Wilcoxon test only for observations in the interval that starts from zero and ends slightly to the right of the formerly estimated RV (see Figure 1). 4. EMPIRICAL SETTING We tested the selective-sharing mechanism in a system that simulates a distributed, Coordinators-like MAS. This testbed environment includes a variable number of agents, each corresponding to a single CA module. Each agent is assigned an external source (simulating an owner) which it periodically samples to obtain a value from the distribution being estimated. The simulation system enabled us to avoid unnecessary inter-agent scheduling and communication overhead (which are an inherent part of the Coordinators environment) and thus to better isolate the performance and effectiveness of the estimation and decision-making mechanisms. The distribution functions used in the experiments (i.e., the distribution functions assigned to each user in the simulated environment) are multi-rectangular shaped. This type of function is ideal for representing empirical distribution functions. It is composed of k rectangles, where each rectangle i is defined over the interval (xi−1, xi), and represents a probability pi, ( Pk i=1 pi =1). For any value x in rectangle i, we can formulate F(x) and f(x) as: f(x) = pi xi − xi−1 F(x) = i−1X j=1 pj + (x − xi−1)pi xi − xi−1 (6) For example, the multi-rectangular function in Figure 3 depicts a possible interruption cost distribution for a specific user. Each rectangle is associated with one of the users typical activities, characterized by a set of typical interruption costs. (We assume the distribution of cost within each activity is uniform.) The rectangular area represents the probability of the user being engaged in this type of activity when she is randomly interrupted. Any overlap between the interruption costs of two or more activities results in a new rectangle for the overlapped interval. The user associated with the above distribution function spends most of her time in reporting (notice that this is the largest rectangle in terms of area), an activity associated with a relatively high cost of interruption. The user also spends a large portion of her time in planning (associated with a very high cost of interruption), monitoring his team (with a relatively small interruption cost) and receiving reports (mid-level cost of interruption). The user spends a relatively small portion of her time in scouting the enemy (associated with relatively high interruption cost) and resting. Figure 3: Representing interruption cost distribution using a multi-rectangular function Multi-rectangular functions are modular and allow the representation of any distribution shape by controlling the number and dimensions of the rectangles used. Furthermore, these functions have computational advantages, mostly due to the ability to re-use many of their components when calculating the optimal reservation value in economical search models. They also fit well the parameters the CA is trying to estimate in fast-paced domains, because these parameters are mostly influenced by activities in which the user is engaged. The testbed system enabled us to define either hand-crafted or automatically generated multi-rectangular distribution functions. At each step of a simulation, each of the CAs samples its owner (i.e., all CAs in the system collect data at a similar rate) and then estimates the parameter (either the expected cost when using the sequential interruption technique described in Section 2 or the probability that the owner will have the required information) using one of the following methods: (a) relying solely on direct observation (self-learning) data; (b) relying on the combined data of all other agents (average all); and, (c) relying on its own data and selective portions of the other agents data based on the selective-sharing mechanism described in Section 3. 5. RESULTS We present the results in two parts: (1) using a specific sample environment for illustrating the basic behavior of the selectivesharing mechanism; and (2) using general environments that were automatically generated. 206 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 5.1 Sample Environment To illustrate the gain obtained by using the selective-sharing mechanism, we used an environment of 10 agents, associated with 5 different interruptibility cost distribution function types. The table in Figure 4 details the division of the 10 agents into types, the dimensions of the rectangles that form the distribution functions, and the theoretical mean and reservation value (RV) (following Equation 3) with a cost c = 2 for sensing the interruption cost. Even though the means of the five types are relatively similar, the use of a reservation-value based interruption strategy yields relatively different expected interruption costs (RV , following Equation 2). The histogram in this figure depicts the number of observations obtained for each bin of size 1 out of a sample of 100000 observations taken from each types distribution function. Type Agents Rect.

Each graph presents the average prediction accuracy (in terms of the absolute deviation from the theoretical value, so the lower the curve the better the performance) of a different type, based on 10000 simulation runs. The three curves in each graph represent the methods being compared (self-learning, average all, and selective-sharing). The data is given as a function of the accumulated number of observations collected. The sixth graph in the figure is the average for all types, weighted according to the number of agents of each type. Similarly, the following table summarizes the overall average performance in terms of the absolute deviation from the theoretical value of each of the different methods: Iterations Self-Learning Averaging-All Selective-Sharing % Improvement3 5 20.08 8.70 9.51 53% 15 12.62 7.84 8.14 36% 40 8.16 7.42 6.35 22% Table 1: Average absolute error along time Several observations may be made from Figure 5. First, although the average-all method may produce relatively good results, it quickly reaches stagnation, while the other two methods exhibit continuous improvement as a function of the amount of accumulated data. For the Figure 4 environment, average-all is a good strategy for agents of type II, IV and V, because the theoretical reservation value of each of these types is close to the one obtained based on the aggregated distribution function (i.e., 21.27).4 However, for types I and III for which the optimal RV differs from that value, the average-all method performs significantly worse. Overall, the sixth graph and the table above show that while in this specific environment the average-all method works well in the first interactions, it 3 The improvement is measured in percentages relative to the self-learning method. 4 The value is obtained by constructing the weighted aggregated distributed function according to the different agents types and extracting the optimal RV using Equation 3. 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Type I 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 selective sharing self-learning average all 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Type II 0 8 16 24 32 40 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Type III 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Type IV 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Type V 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Weighted Average Figure 5: Average absolute deviation from the theoretical RV in each method (10000 runs) is quickly outperformed by the selective-sharing mechanism. Furthermore, the more user observations the agents accumulate (i.e., as we extend the horizontal axis), the better the other two methods are in comparison to average-all. In the long run (and as shown in the following subsection for the general case), the average-all method exhibits the worst performance. Second, the selective-sharing mechanism starts with a significant improvement in comparison to relying on the agents own observations, and then this improvement gradually decreases until finally its performance curve coincides with the self-learning methods curve. The selective-sharing mechanism performs better or worse, depending on the type, because the Wilcoxon test cannot guarantee an exact identification of similarity; different combinations of distribution function can result in an inability to exactly identify the similar users for some of the specific types. For example, for type I agents, the selective-sharing mechanism actually performs worse than self-learning in the short term (in the long run the two methods performance converge). Nevertheless, for the other types in our example, the selective-sharing mechanism is the most efficient one, and outperforms the other two methods overall. Third, it is notable that for agents that have a unique type (e.g., agent III), the selective-sharing mechanism quickly converges towards relying on self-collected data. This behavior guarantees that even in scenarios in which users are completely different, the method exhibits a graceful initial degradation but manages, within a few time steps, to adopt the proper behavior of counting exclusively on self-generated data. Last, despite the difference in their overall distribution function, agents of type IV and V exhibit similar performance because the relevant portion of their distribution functions (i.e., the effective parts that affect the RV calculation as explained in Figure 1) is identical. Thus, the selective-sharing mechanism enables the agent of type V, despite its unique distribution function, to adopt relevant information collected by agents of types IV which improves its estimation of the expected interruption cost. 5.2 General Evaluation To evaluate selective-sharing, we ran a series of simulations in which the environment was randomly generated. These experiments focused on the CAs estimations of the probability that the user would have the required information if interrupted. They used a multi-rectangular probability distribution function to represent The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 207 the amount of communication the user is engaged in with its environment. We models the growth of the probability the user has the required information as a function of the amount of communication using the logistic function,5 G(x) = 1 + e −x 12 1 + 60e −x 12 . (7) The expected (mean) value of the parameter representing the probability the user has the required information is thus μ = Z ∞ y=0 G(y)f(y)dy = kX i=1 hx + 708ln(60 + e x 12 )pi 60(xi − xi−1) ixi xi−1 (8) where k is the number of rectangles used. We ran 10000 simulation runs. For each simulation, a new 20-agent environment was automatically generated by the system, and the agents were randomly divided into a random number of different types.6 For each type, a random 3-rectangle distribution function was generated. Each simulation ran 40 time steps. At each time step each one of the agents accumulated one additional observation. Each CA calculated an estimate of the probability its user had the necessary information according to the three methods, and the absolute error (difference from the theoretical value calculated according to Equation 8) was recorded. The following table summarizes the average performance of the three mechanisms along different time horizons (measured at 5, 15 and 40 time steps): Iterations Self-Learning Averaging-All Selective-Sharing % Improvement 5 0.176 0.099 0.103 41.4% 15 0.115 0.088 0.087 23.9% 40 0.075 0.082 0.065 13.6% Table 2: Average absolute error along time steps As can be seen in the table above, the proposed selective-sharing method outperforms the two other methods over any execution in which more than 15 observations are collected by each of the agents. As in the sample environment, the average-all method performs well in the initial few time steps, but does not exhibit further improvement. Thus, the more data collected, the greater the difference between this latter method and the two other methods. The average difference between selective-sharing and self-learning decreases as more data is collected. Finally, we measured the effect of the number of types in the environment. For this purpose, we used the same self-generation method, but controlled the number of types generated for each run. The number of types is a good indication for the level of heterogeneity in the environment. For each number of types, we ran 10000 simulations. Figure 6 depicts the performance of the different methods (for a 40-observation collection period for each agent). Since all simulation runs used for generating Figure 6 are based on the same seed, the performance of the self-learning mechanism is constant regardless of the number of types in the environment. As expected, the average-all mechanism performs best when all agents are of the same type; however its performance deteriorates as the number of types increases. Similarly, the selective-sharing mechanism exhibits good results when all agents are of the same type, and as the number of types increases, its performance deteriorates. However, the performance decrease is significantly more modest in comparison to the one experienced in the average-all mechanism. 5 The specific coefficients used guarantee an S-like curve of growth, along the interval (0, 100), where the initial stage of growth is approximately exponential, followed by asymptotically slowing growth. 6 In this suggested environment-generation scheme there is no guarantee that every agent will have a potential similar agent to share information with. In those non-rare scenarios where the CA is the only one of its type, it will rapidly need to stop relying on others. 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 1 2 3 4 5 Self Learning Average All Selective Sharing number of types averageabsoluteerror Figure 6: Average absolute deviation from actual value in 20 agent scenarios as a function of the agents heterogeneity level Overall, the selective-sharing mechanism outperforms both other methods for any number of types greater than one. 6. RELATED WORK In addition to the interruption management literature reviewed in Section 2, several other areas of prior work are relevant to the selective-sharing mechanism described in this paper. Collaborative filtering, which makes predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user [7], operates similarly to selective-sharing. However, collaborative filtering systems exhibit poor performance when there is not sufficient information about the users and when there is not sufficient information about a new user whose taste the system attempts to predict [7]. Selective-sharing relies on the ability to find similarity between specific parts of the probability distribution function associated with a characteristic of different users. This capability is closely related to clustering and classification, an area widely studied in machine learning. Given space considerations, our review of this area is restricted to some representative approaches for clustering. In spite of the richness of available clustering algorithms (such as the famous K-means clustering algorithm [11], hierarchical methods, Bayesian classifiers [6], and maximum entropy), various characteristics of fast-paced domains do not align well with the features of attributesbased clustering mechanisms, suggesting these mechanisms would not perform well in such domains. Of particular importance is that the CA needs to find similarity between functions, defined over a continuous interval, with no distinct pre-defined attributes. An additional difficulty is defining the distance measure. Many clustering techniques have been used in data mining [2], with particular focus on incremental updates of the clustering, due to the very large size of the databases [3]. However the applicability of these to fast-paced domains is quite limited because they rely on a large set of existing data. Similarly, clustering algorithms designed for the task of class identification in spatial databases (e.g., relying on a density-based notion [4]) are not useful for our case, because our data has no spatial attributes. The most relevant method for our purposes is the Kullback-Leibler relative entropy index that is used in probability theory and information theory [12]. This measure, which can also be applied on continuous random variables, relies on a natural distance measure from a true probability distribution (either observation-based or calculated) to an arbitrary probability distribution. However, the method will perform poorly in scenarios in which the functions alternate between different levels while keeping the general structure and moments. For example, consider the two functions f(x) = ( x mod2)/100 and g(x) = ( x mod2)/100 defined over the interval (0, 200). While these two functions are associated with almost identical reservation values (for any sampling cost) and mean, the Kullback-Leibler method will assign a poor correlation between 208 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) them, while our Wilcoxon-based approach will give them the highest rank in terms of similarity. While the Wilcoxon test is a widely used statistical procedure [22, 14], it is usually used for comparing two sets of single-variate data. To our knowledge, no attempt has been made yet to extend its properties as an infrastructure for determining with whom and to what extent information should be shared, as presented in this paper. Typical use of this non-parametric tool includes detection of rare events in time series (e.g., a hard drive failure prediction [17]) and bioinformatics applications (e.g., finding informative genes from microarray data). In these applications, it is used primarily as an identification tool and ranking criterion. 7. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The selective-sharing mechanism presented in this paper does not make any assumptions about the format of the data used or about the structure of the distribution function of the parameter to be estimated. It is computationally lightweight and very simple to execute. Selective-sharing allows an agent to benefit from other agents observations in scenarios in which data sources of the same type are available. It also guarantees, as a fallback, performance equivalent to that of a self-learner when the information source is unique. Furthermore, selective-sharing does not require any prior knowledge about the types of information sources available in the environment or of the number of agents associated with each type. The results of our simulations demonstrate the selective-sharing mechanisms effectiveness in improving the estimation produced for probabilistic parameters based on a limited set of observations. Furthermore, most of the improvement is achieved in initial interactions, which is of great importance for agents operating in fast-paced environments. Although we tested the selective-sharing mechanism in the context of the Coordinators project, it is applicable in any MAS environment having the characteristics of a fast-paced environment (e.g., rescue environments). Evidence for its general effectiveness is given in the general evaluation section, where environments were continuously randomly generated. The Wilcoxon statistic used as described in this paper to provide a classifier for similarity between users provides high flexibility with low computational costs and is applicable for any characteristic being learned. Its use provides a good measure of similarity which an agent can use to decide how much external information to adopt for its assessments. 8.

Introducción Para muchos escenarios del mundo real, los agentes autónomos deben operar en entornos dinámicos e inciertos en los que solo tienen información incompleta sobre los resultados de sus acciones y características de otros agentes o personas con las que necesitan cooperar o colaborar. En tales entornos, los agentes pueden beneficiarse al compartir la información que recopilan, agrupando sus experiencias individuales para mejorar sus estimaciones de parámetros desconocidos necesarios para el razonamiento sobre las acciones bajo incertidumbre. Este documento aborda el problema de aprender la distribución de los valores de un parámetro probabilístico que representa una característica de una persona que interactúa con un agente informático. La característica a aprender es (o está claramente relacionada) con un factor importante en la toma de decisiones de los agentes.1 El entorno básico que consideramos es uno en el que un agente acumula observaciones sobre una característica específica del usuario y las usa para producir una estimación oportuna deAlguna medida que depende de esa distribución de características. Los mecanismos que desarrollamos están diseñados para ser útiles en una variedad de dominios de aplicación, como el rescate de desastres, que se caracterizan por entornos en los que las condiciones pueden cambiar rápidamente, las acciones (ya sea de agentes autónomos o de personas) y las operaciones generales se producen enUn ritmo rápido, y las decisiones deben tomarse dentro de marcos de tiempo muy limitados. Por lo general, los agentes deben tomar decisiones en tiempo real, concurrentes con la ejecución de la tarea y en medio de gran incertidumbre. En el resto de este documento, utilizamos el término acelerado para referirnos a dichos entornos. En entornos de ritmo rápido, la recopilación de información puede ser limitada, y no es posible aprender fuera de línea o esperar hasta que se recopilen grandes cantidades de datos antes de tomar decisiones. Los entornos de ritmo rápido imponen tres restricciones en cualquier mecanismo para aprender una función de distribución (incluida la amplia gama de técnicas de actualización bayesiana [23]): (a) La restricción de no estructura: no hay información a priori sobre la estructura de la distribución de parámetros estimados nicualquier datos iniciales de los cuales se puede inferir dicha estructura está disponible;(b) la restricción de uso limitado: los agentes generalmente necesitan producir solo un pequeño número de estimaciones en total para este parámetro;(c) La restricción de uso temprano: la alta precisión es un requisito crítico incluso en las etapas iniciales del aprendizaje. Por lo tanto, el objetivo de los métodos de estimación presentados en este documento es minimizar el error promedio con el tiempo, en lugar de determinar un valor preciso al final de un largo período de interacción. Es decir, se espera que el agente trabaje con el usuario por un tiempo limitado, e intenta minimizar el error general en sus estimaciones. En tales entornos, los agentes adquiridos individualmente (sus propias observaciones) son demasiado escasos para que obtenga buenas estimaciones en el marco de tiempo requerido. Dada la restricción sin estructura del entorno, los enfoques que dependen de distribuciones estructuradas pueden dar como resultado un sesgo de estimación significativamente alto. Consideramos este problema en el contexto de un sistema distribuido de múltiples agentes en el que los agentes informáticos apoyan a las personas que realizan tareas complejas en un entorno dinámico. El hecho de que los agentes formen parte de un entorno de múltiples agentes, en el que otros agentes pueden 1 aprender la distribución en lugar de solo determinar algún valor en la distribución es importante cada vez que la forma general de la distribución y no solo las características individuales como la media son importantes..También recopilar datos para estimar una característica similar de sus usuarios, ofrece la posibilidad de que un agente aumente sus propias observaciones con las de otros agentes, mejorando así la precisión de su proceso de aprendizaje. Además, en los entornos que consideramos, los agentes generalmente acumulan datos a una velocidad relativamente similar. No obstante, la medida en que las observaciones de otros agentes serán útiles para un agente dado depende de la medida en que las distribuciones de características de sus usuarios se correlacionen con las del usuario de este agente. No hay garantía de que la distribución para dos agentes diferentes esté altamente correlacionada positivamente, y mucho menos que sean las mismas. Por lo tanto, para utilizar un enfoque de intercambio de datos, un mecanismo de aprendizaje debe ser capaz de identificar de manera efectiva el nivel de correlación entre los datos recopilados por diferentes agentes y sopesar datos compartidos dependiendo del nivel de correlación. El diseño de un módulo de autonomía de coordinación (CA) dentro de un sistema de administrador de coordinación (como parte del Proyecto de Coordinadores de DARPA [18]), en el que los agentes admiten una tarea de programación distribuida, proporcionó la motivación inicial y una configuración conceptual para este trabajo. Sin embargo, los mecanismos en sí son generales y pueden aplicarse no solo a otros dominios de ritmo rápido, sino también en otros entornos de múltiples agentes en los que los agentes recopilan datos que se superponen en cierta medida, a tasas aproximadamente similares, y en el que el entornoimpone las restricciones sin estructura, de uso limitado y temprano definidos anteriormente (por ejemplo, exploración de planetas remotos). En particular, nuestras técnicas serían útiles en cualquier entorno en el que un grupo de agentes realice una tarea en un nuevo entorno, con cada agente obteniendo observaciones a una tasa similar de parámetros individuales que necesitan para su toma de decisiones. En este artículo, presentamos un mecanismo que se utilizó para aprender características clave del usuario en entornos de ritmo rápido. El mecanismo proporciona estimaciones relativamente precisas dentro de los cuadros de tiempo cortos al aumentar las observaciones directas de los agentes individuales con observaciones obtenidas por otros agentes con los que está coordinando. En particular, nos centramos en los problemas relacionados de estimar el costo de interrumpir a una persona y estimar la probabilidad de que esa persona tenga la información requerida por el sistema. Nuestro enfoque adaptativo, al que nos referiremos en todo el documento como comercio compartido selectivo, permite que nuestra CA mejore la precisión de sus estimaciones basadas en la distribución en comparación con confiar solo en las interacciones con un usuario específico (posteriormente, autoaprendizaje) oAgrupar todos los datos incondicionalmente (promedio todo), en particular cuando el número de observaciones disponibles es relativamente pequeña. El mecanismo se probó con éxito utilizando un sistema que simula un entorno de coordinadores. La siguiente sección del documento describe el problema de estimar los parámetros relacionados con el usuario en dominios acelerados. La Sección 3 proporciona una descripción general de los métodos que desarrollamos. La implementación, la configuración empírica y los resultados se dan en las Secciones 4 y 5. Se da una comparación con los métodos relacionados en la Sección 6 y las conclusiones en la Sección 7. 2. Estimación de parámetros en dominios con espacio rápido El módulo CA y los algoritmos que describimos en este documento se desarrollaron y probaron en el dominio de los Coordinadores [21]. En este dominio, los agentes autónomos, llamados coordinadores, tienen la intención de ayudar a maximizar un objetivo general del equipo al manejar los cambios en el horario de tareas a medida que cambian las condiciones de operación. Cada agente opera en nombre de su propietario (por ejemplo, el líder del equipo de un equipo de Firstesponse o un comandante de la unidad) cuyo horario administra. Por lo tanto, las tareas reales que se están programando son ejecutadas por propietarios o por unidades que supervisan, y la responsabilidad de los agentes se limita a mantener la programación de estas tareas y coordinar con los agentes de otros miembros del equipo humano (es decir, otros propietarios). En este dominio, se distribuyen información y limitaciones de programación. Cada agente recibe una visión diferente de las tareas y estructuras que constituyen el problema completo de múltiples agentes, típicamente, solo una parcial, local. El horario de las revisiones que afectan a más de un agente deben coordinarse, por lo que los agentes deben compartir ciertos tipos de información.(En un contexto de equipo, pueden estar diseñados para compartir otros tipos también). Sin embargo, la naturaleza acelerada del dominio limita la cantidad de información que pueden compartir, lo que impide una solución centralizada;Los problemas de programación deben resolverse de manera distribuida. La relación del agente y propietario es colaborativa, y el agente necesita interactuar con su propietario para obtener información de tareas y medio ambiente relevante para la programación. El módulo CA es responsable de decidir de manera inteligente cuándo y cómo interactuar con el propietario para mejorar la programación de los agentes. Como resultado, la CA debe estimar el beneficio esperado de dicha interacción y el costo asociado con ella [19]. En general, el beneficio neto de una interacción potencial es PV - C, donde V es el valor de la información que puede tener el usuario, P es la probabilidad de que el usuario tenga esta información y C es el costo asociado con una interacción. Los valores de P, V y C son variables en el tiempo, y la CA estima su valor en el momento previsto de iniciar la interacción con su propietario. Este documento se centra en los problemas gemelos de estimar los parámetros P y C, los cuales están centrados en el usuario en el sentido de estar determinados por las características del propietario y el entorno en el que el propietario está operando);supone un mecanismo para determinar V [18].2.1 Estimación de costos de interrupción El costo de interrumpir a los propietarios deriva de la degradación potencial en el rendimiento de las tareas que están haciendo causadas por la interrupción [1;9, entre otros]. La investigación sobre la gestión de la interacción ha implementado modelos estadísticos basados en sensores de interrupción humana para inferir el grado de distracción que probablemente sea causado por una interrupción. Este trabajo tiene como objetivo reducir los costos de interrupción al retrasar las interrupciones a los tiempos que son convenientes. Por lo general, utiliza modelos bayesianos para aprender un foco de atención actual o probable de los usuarios de un flujo continuo de acciones. Al usar sensores para proporcionar indicaciones entrantes continuas del estado atencional de los usuarios, estos modelos intentan proporcionar un medio para calcular las distribuciones de probabilidad sobre la atención e intenciones de los usuarios [9]. El trabajo que examina los factores de costo de interrupción como la frustración y la distractibilidad del usuario [10] incluye el trabajo sobre el costo de molestar repetidamente al usuario, lo que tiene en cuenta el hecho de que las interrupciones recientes y las preguntas difíciles deberían tener más peso que las interrupciones en el pasado distante o directoPreguntas [5]. Aunque este trabajo previo utiliza estimaciones de interrupción para equilibrar las interacciones estimadas de importancia contra el grado de distracción que probablemente sea causado, difiere del problema de entornos de ritmo rápido que abordamos de tres maneras que cambian fundamentalmente la naturaleza del problema y, por lo tanto, alteran la posible la posiblesoluciones. Primero, considera la configuración en la que el sistema informático tiene información que puede ser relevante para su usuario en lugar de que el usuario (propietario) tenga información que el sistema necesita, que es el complemento de la situación de intercambio de información que consideramos. En segundo lugar, los modelos de estimación de interrupción se basan en tareas. Por último, se basa en el monitoreo continuo de las actividades de los usuarios. En entornos de ritmo rápido, generalmente no hay una estructura de tareas única, y algunas de las actividades en sí mismas pueden tener poca estructura interna. Como resultado, es difícil determinar el estado atencional real de los propietarios de agentes [15]. En tales entornos, los propietarios deben tomar decisiones complejas que generalmente involucran a otros miembros de sus unidades, mientras que permanecen reactivos a los eventos que divergen de las expectativas [24]. Por ejemplo, durante el rescate por desastre, una unidad de primera respuesta puede comenzar a rescatar a los sobrevivientes atrapados en una casa en llamas, cuando una pared se derrumba repentinamente, obligando a la unidad a la sexta intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 203 Retraiga y replique sus acciones. El trabajo previo ha seguido el enfoque de la atención de los usuarios utilizando una variedad de dispositivos, incluidos los capaces de monitorear los gestos [8] y rastrear los ojos para identificar la atención visual [13, 20], lo que permite estimaciones de carga cognitiva e indicadores físicos de degradación del rendimiento. Los mecanismos descritos en este documento también suponen la existencia de tales sensores. Sin embargo, en contraste con el trabajo previo, que se basa en estos dispositivos que operan continuamente, nuestro mecanismo supone que los entornos de ritmo rápido solo permiten la activación de sensores por cortos períodos de tiempo de forma ad-hoc, porque los recursos de los agentes son severamente limitados. Los métodos que dependen de predecir lo que una persona hará a continuación solo en lo que el usuario está haciendo actualmente (por ejemplo, MDP) no son apropiados para modelar el enfoque de atención en los dominios de ritmo rápido, porque un agente no puede confiar en que el estado atencional de una persona sea atencional que seaBien estructurado y el monitoreo solo se puede hacer de forma esporádica y no continua. Por lo tanto, en cualquier momento, el costo de interacción con el usuario es esencialmente probabilístico, como se refleja en un solo evento de monitoreo aleatorio, y se le puede asignar una función de distribución de probabilidad. En consecuencia, en entornos de ritmo rápido, un agente necesita una estrategia de muestreo mediante la cual la CA muestrea el nivel de interrupción de sus propietarios (con algún costo) y decide si iniciar una interacción en este momento específico o retrasar hasta que se observe un costo más bajo en el futuromuestras. El método que describimos en el resto de esta subsección aplica conceptos de la teoría de la búsqueda económica [16] a este problema. La estimación de costos de CAS utiliza un mecanismo que integra la distribución de un nivel de interrupción de los propietarios (según lo estimado por la CA) en una estrategia de búsqueda económica, de manera que se minimice el costo general combinado de los costos del sensor y los costos de interacción. En su forma más básica, el problema de búsqueda económica tiene como objetivo identificar una oportunidad que minimice el costo esperado o maximizará la utilidad esperada. El proceso de búsqueda en sí está asociado con un costo y las oportunidades (en nuestro caso, oportunidades de interrupción) están asociados con una función de distribución estacionaria. Utilizamos una estrategia de búsqueda secuencial [16] en la que se dibuja una observación a la vez, en múltiples etapas de búsqueda. La estrategia dominante en este modelo es una estrategia basada en el valor de reserva que determina un límite inferior y sigue dibujando muestras siempre que no se haya dibujado ninguna oportunidad por encima del límite. En particular, consideramos la situación en la que el propietario de un agente tiene un costo de interrupción descrito por una función de distribución de probabilidad (PDF) F (x) y una función de distribución acumulativa (CDF) F (x). El agente puede activar los dispositivos de detección para obtener una estimación del costo de interrupción, X, en el momento actual, pero hay un costo C de operar los dispositivos de detección para una sola unidad de tiempo. El módulo CA establece un valor de reserva y siempre que la observación basada en el sensor X sea mayor que este valor de reserva, la CA esperará y volverá a mostrar al usuario para una nueva estimación. El costo esperado, V (XRV), utilizando dicha estrategia con valor de reserva XRV se describe mediante la Ecuación 1, V (XRV) = C + R XRV y = 0 yf (y) F (XRV), (1) que se descompone endos partes. La primera parte, C dividida por F (XRV), representa el costo de muestreo esperado. El segundo, la integral dividida por F (XRV), representa el costo esperado de la interrupción, porque el número esperado de ciclos de búsqueda es (aleatorio) geométrico y la probabilidad de éxito es F (XRV). Tomando la derivada del lado izquierdo de la ecuación 1 y igualarlo a cero, produce las características del valor de reserva óptimo, a saber, x ∗ rv debe satisfacer, v (x ∗ rv) = x ∗ rv.(2) Sustituir (2) en la ecuación 1 produce la ecuación 3 (después de la integración por partes) de la cual se puede calcular el valor de reserva óptimo, x ∗ rv y, en consecuencia, (de la ecuación 2) V (x ∗ rv) se puede calcular.c = z x ∗ rv y = 0 f (y) (3) Este método, que depende de extraer la secuencia óptima de muestreo de usuarios basado en sensores, depende en gran medida de la estructura de la función de distribución, F (x). Sin embargo, solo necesitamos una parte de la función de distribución, a saber, del origen al valor de reserva.(Ver la ecuación 1 y la Figura 1.) Por lo tanto, cuando consideramos compartir datos, no es necesario confiar en la similitud completa en la función de distribución de diferentes usuarios. Para algunos parámetros, incluido el nivel de interrupción de los usuarios, es suficiente para confiar en la similitud en la parte relevante de la función de distribución. La implementación descrita en las Secciones 4-5 se basa en este hecho. Figura 1: La estructura de distribución que afecta el cálculo de costos esperados 2.2 Estimando la probabilidad de tener información una forma en que un agente puede estimar la probabilidad de que un usuario tenga información que necesita (por ejemplo, sabrá en un tiempo de interrupción específico, con cierto nivel de confiabilidad,El resultado real de una tarea que se está ejecutando actualmente) es confiar en interacciones previas con este usuario, calculando la relación entre el número de veces que el usuario tuvo la información y el número total de interacciones. Alternativamente, el agente puede intentar inferir esta probabilidad de las características medibles del comportamiento de los usuarios, lo que puede evaluar sin requerir una interrupción. Este enfoque indirecto, que no requiere interrumpir al usuario, es especialmente útil en dominios de ritmo rápido. El módulo de CA que diseñamos utiliza un método indirecto: las interacciones del medio ambiente del propietario se utilizan como un proxy para medir si el propietario tiene cierta información. Por ejemplo, en escenarios similares a los coordinadores, los propietarios pueden obtener una variedad de información a través de reuniones de coordinación ocasionales de todos los propietarios, comunicación directa con otros propietarios individuales que participan en la ejecución de una tarea conjunta (a través de la cual pueden aprender informalmente sobre la existencia o estado de otrosAcciones que están ejecutando), abiertas comunicaciones que escuchan (por ejemplo, si los comandantes dejan sus radios abiertas, pueden escuchar mensajes asociados con otros equipos en su área) y otros canales de comunicación formales o informales [24]. Por lo tanto, los niveles de comunicación de los propietarios con otros, que se pueden obtener sin interrumpirlos, proporcionan alguna indicación de la frecuencia con la que obtienen nueva información. Dadas las actualizaciones ocasionales sobre su nivel de comunicación de propietarios, la CA puede estimar la probabilidad de que una interacción aleatoria con el propietario genere la información que necesita. Denota la función de distribución de probabilidad de la cantidad de comunicación que el usuario generalmente mantiene con su entorno por g (x) y utilizando la función de transformación z (x), mapeando de un nivel de comunicación, x, a la probabilidad de tener la información,La probabilidad esperada de obtener la información que se necesita del propietario al interrumpir en un momento dado se puede calcular a partir de P = Z ∞ 0 Z (x) G (x) Dy.(4) 204 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07), cuantas más observaciones se pueda acumular un agente sobre la distribución de la frecuencia de la interacción de los propietarios con el entorno en un momento dado, mejor puede estimar la probabilidad que el propietario tenga la información necesariapor el sistema.3. El mecanismo de intercambio selectivo Esta sección presenta el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo por el cual la CA aprende la función de distribución de un parámetro probabilístico aprovechando los datos recopilados por otros CA en su entorno. Primero explicamos la necesidad de aumentar el número de observaciones utilizadas como base de la estimación y luego presentar un método para determinar cuántos datos adoptar de otros agentes. El método más directo para que la CA aprenda las funciones de distribución asociadas con los diferentes parámetros que caracterizan a un propietario es construir un histograma basado en las observaciones que ha acumulado hasta el punto de estimación. Según este histograma, la CA puede estimar el parámetro teniendo en cuenta el rango completo de valores (por ejemplo, para estimar la media) o una parte de la misma (por ejemplo, para encontrar el costo esperado al usar un valor de reserva basado en el valor de la reservaestrategia). La precisión de la estimación variará ampliamente si se basa solo en un pequeño número de observaciones. Por ejemplo, la Figura 2 ilustra el costo basado en el valor de reserva calculado de acuerdo con las observaciones recibidas de un propietario con una distribución de costos de interrupción uniforme U (0, 100) en función del número de observaciones acumuladas utilizadas para generar el histograma de distribución.(En esta simulación, se consideró que el costo de activación del dispositivo era C = 0.5). Figura 2: La convergencia de una sola CA a su estrategia óptima estas desviaciones del valor real (verdadero) (que es 10 en este caso, según la ecuación 3) se debe a que la muestra utilizada en cada etapa no puede capturar con precisión la estructura real dela función de distribución. Finalmente, este método produce una estimación muy precisa para el costo de interrupción esperado. Sin embargo, en las etapas iniciales del proceso, su estimación se desvía significativamente del valor real. Este error podría degradar seriamente el proceso de toma de decisiones de CAS: la subestimación del costo puede resultar en iniciar interacciones costosas y no beneficiosas, y sobreestimar el costo puede dar lugar a oportunidades faltantes para interacciones valiosas. Cualquier mejora que se pueda lograr al predecir los valores de costos, especialmente en las etapas iniciales del aprendizaje, puede marcar una diferencia significativa en el rendimiento, especialmente porque el agente está severamente limitado en el número de veces que puede interactuar con su propietario en dominios con espacio rápido. Una forma de disminuir la desviación del valor real es aumentar los datos que la CA adquiere observando a su propietario con observaciones hechas por otros agentes de propietarios. Tal enfoque depende de identificar a otros propietarios con funciones de distribución para la característica de interés similar al propietario de CAS. Esta idea de dataugmentation es simple: diferentes propietarios pueden exhibir comportamientos o patrones básicos similares en escenarios de tareas de ritmo rápido similares. Dado que todos están coordinando en una tarea general común y están operando en el mismo entorno, es razonable asumir cierto nivel de similitud en la función de distribución de sus parámetros modelados. Las personas varían en su comportamiento, por lo que, obviamente, puede haber diferentes tipos de propietarios: algunos enfatizarán la comunicación con sus equipos y otros pasarán más tiempo en la planificación basada en mapas;A algunos les disgustará ser perturbados mientras intentan evaluar el progreso de sus equipos, mientras que otros pueden estar más abiertos a las interrupciones. En consecuencia, es probable que un propietario CA pueda encontrar algunos CA que trabajen con propietarios que sean similares a su propietario. Al adoptar datos recopilados por otros agentes, las dos preguntas principales son en qué agentes deben confiar la CA y en qué medida debe confiar en cada uno de ellos. El mecanismo de intercambio selectivo se basa en una medida estadística de similitud que permite a la CA de cualquier usuario específico identificar la similitud entre su propietario y otros propietarios dinámicamente. Según este nivel de similitud, la CA decide si y en qué medida importar otros datos CAS para aumentar sus observaciones directas y, por lo tanto, permitir un mejor modelado de las características de sus propietarios. Es notable que el costo de transferir observaciones entre diferentes módulos de CA de diferentes agentes sea relativamente pequeño. Esta información puede transferirse como parte de la comunicación regular de negociación entre los agentes. El volumen de dicha comunicación es insignificante: implica solo la transmisión de nuevos valores de observaciones. En nuestro mecanismo de aprendizaje, la CA actualiza constantemente su estimación del nivel de similitud entre su propietario y los propietarios representados por otros CA en el entorno. Cada nueva observación obtenida por esa CA o cualquiera de las otras actualizaciones de CAS esta estimación. El nivel de similitud se determina utilizando la prueba de suma de rango Wilcoxon (subsección 3.1). Siempre que sea necesario producir una estimación de parámetros, la CA decide sobre el número de observaciones adicionales en las que tiene la intención de confiar para extraer su estimación. El número de observaciones adicionales que se tomarán del agente de otro es una función del número de observaciones que tiene actualmente de interacciones anteriores con su propietario y el nivel de confianza que la CA tiene en la similitud entre su propietario y otros propietarios. En la mayoría de los casos, el número de observaciones que la CA querrá tomar de otro agente es menor que el número general de observaciones que tiene el otro agente;Por lo tanto, muestra al azar (sin repeticiones) el número requerido de observaciones de esta base de datos de otros agentes. Las observaciones adicionales que la CA toma de otros agentes se usa solo para modelar las características de sus propietarios. La determinación del nivel de similitud futura no se ve afectada por este procedimiento de aumento de información.3.1 La prueba de Wilcoxon usamos un método no paramétrico (es decir, uno que no ofrece suposiciones sobre la forma paramétrica de las distribuciones de las que se extrae cada conjunto), porque las características del usuario en dominios de ritmo rápido no tienen la estructura necesaria para enfoques paramétricos. Dos ventajas adicionales de un enfoque no paramétrico son su utilidad para lidiar con observaciones inesperadas y periféricas (posiblemente problemáticas para un enfoque paramétrico), y el hecho de que los enfoques no paramétricos son computacionalmente muy simples y, por lo tanto.escaso. La prueba de suma de rango Wilcoxon que usamos es una alternativa no paramétrica a la prueba t de dos muestras [22, 14] 2. Mientras que la prueba t se compara significa, la prueba de Wilcoxon se puede usar para probar la hipótesis nula de que dos poblaciones x e y tienen la misma distribución continua. Suponemos que tenemos muestras aleatorias independientes {x1, x2, ..., xm} y {y1, y2, ..., yn}, de tamaños my n respectivamente, de cada población. Luego fusionamos los datos y clasificamos cada medición de más baja a más alta. A todas las secuencias de lazos se les asigna un rango promedio. De la suma de las filas de la prueba de bondad de ajuste de 2 chi-cuadrado más pequeña es para una sola muestra y, por lo tanto, no es adecuada. El sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y los sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 205 muestra, calculamos el estadístico de prueba y extraemos el nivel de confianza para rechazar la hipótesis nula. Este nivel de confianza se convierte en la medida del nivel de similitud entre los dos propietarios. La prueba de Wilcoxon no requiere que los datos se origen de una población normalmente distribuida o que la distribución se caracterice por un conjunto finito de parámetros.3.2 Determinar la información requerida identificando correctamente el número correcto de observaciones adicionales para recopilar es un determinante clave del éxito del mecanismo de intercambio selectivo. Obviamente, si la CA puede identificar a otro propietario que tiene características idénticas al propietario que representa, entonces debería usar todas las observaciones recopiladas por ese agente de propietarios. Sin embargo, es probable que los casos de coincidencias idénticas sean muy poco comunes. Además, incluso para establecer que otro usuario es idéntico al suyo, la CA necesitaría tamaños de muestra sustanciales para tener un nivel de confianza relativamente alto. Por lo tanto, por lo general, la CA necesita decidir cuánto depender de los datos de otros agentes al tiempo que estiman varios niveles de similitud con un nivel cambiante de confianza. Al comienzo de su proceso, el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo casi no tiene datos en los que confiar y, por lo tanto, no se puede utilizar una medida de similitud. En este caso, el módulo CA depende en gran medida de otros agentes, con la expectativa de que todos los propietarios tengan un nivel básico de similitud en su distribución (ver Sección 2). A medida que aumenta el número de sus observaciones directas, el módulo CA refina el número de observaciones adicionales requeridas. Nuevamente, hay dos efectos contradictorios. Por un lado, cuantos más datos tenga la CA, mejor puede determinar su nivel de confianza en las calificaciones de similitud que tiene para otros propietarios. Por otro lado, suponiendo que hay alguna diferencia entre los propietarios (incluso si aún no se nota), a medida que aumenta el número de sus observaciones directas, los propietarios poseen datos deberían aumentar de peso en su análisis. Por lo tanto, cuando CAI decide cuántas observaciones adicionales, se debe adoptar oi J de la base de datos de CAJS, calcula Oi J como sigue: oi j = n ∗ (1 - αi, j) √ n + 2 + ln (n) n (5) Donde N es el número de observaciones que CAI ya tiene (que es similar en magnitud al número de observaciones que CAJ tiene) y αi, J es la confianza de rechazar la hipótesis nula de Wilcoxon. La función en la ecuación 5 asegura que el número de observaciones adicionales que se tomarán de otro módulo CA aumenta a medida que aumenta la confianza en la similitud con la fuente de estas observaciones adicionales. Al mismo tiempo, asegura que el nivel de dependencia de las observaciones externas disminuya a medida que aumenta el número de observaciones directas. Al calcular el parámetro αi, J, siempre realizamos la prueba durante el intervalo relevante para la función de distribución de CAS de origen. Por ejemplo, al estimar el costo de interrumpir al usuario, aplicamos la prueba de Wilcoxon solo para observaciones en el intervalo que comienza desde cero y termina ligeramente a la derecha del RV anteriormente estimado (ver Figura 1).4. Configuración empírica probamos el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo en un sistema que simula un MAS distribuido, similar a los coordinadores. Este entorno de Testbed incluye un número variable de agentes, cada uno correspondiente a un solo módulo de CA. A cada agente se le asigna una fuente externa (simulando un propietario) que muestra periódicamente para obtener un valor de la distribución que se estima. El sistema de simulación nos permitió evitar la sobrecarga innecesaria de la programación y la comunicación entre agentes (que son una parte inherente del entorno de los coordinadores) y, por lo tanto, aislar mejor el rendimiento y la efectividad de los mecanismos de estimación y toma de decisiones. Las funciones de distribución utilizadas en los experimentos (es decir, las funciones de distribución asignadas a cada usuario en el entorno simulado) son de forma multirrectangular. Este tipo de función es ideal para representar funciones de distribución empírica. Se compone de k rectángulos, donde cada rectángulo I se define durante el intervalo (xi - 1, xi), y representa una probabilidad Pi, (Pk i = 1 pi = 1). Para cualquier valor x en el rectángulo I, podemos formular f (x) y f (x) como: f (x) = pi xi - xi - 1 f (x) = i - 1x j = 1 pj + (x - xi−1) Pi xi-xi-1 (6) Por ejemplo, la función multirrectangular en la Figura 3 representa una posible distribución de costos de interrupción para un usuario específico. Cada rectángulo está asociado con una de las actividades típicas de los usuarios, caracterizadas por un conjunto de costos de interrupción típicos.(Asumimos que la distribución del costo dentro de cada actividad es uniforme). El área rectangular representa la probabilidad de que el usuario participe en este tipo de actividad cuando se interrumpe al azar. Cualquier superposición entre los costos de interrupción de dos o más actividades da como resultado un nuevo rectángulo para el intervalo superpuesto. El usuario asociado con la función de distribución anterior pasa la mayor parte de su tiempo en la presentación de informes (observe que este es el rectángulo más grande en términos de área), una actividad asociada con un costo relativamente alto de interrupción. El usuario también pasa una gran parte de su tiempo en planificación (asociado con un costo muy alto de interrupción), monitoreando a su equipo (con un costo de interrupción relativamente pequeño) y recibir informes (costo de interrupción de nivel medio). El usuario pasa una porción relativamente pequeña de su tiempo en explorar al enemigo (asociado con un costo de interrupción relativamente alto) y descansando. Figura 3: Representar la distribución de los costos de interrupción utilizando una función multirrectangular Las funciones multirangulares son modulares y permiten la representación de cualquier forma de distribución controlando el número y las dimensiones de los rectángulos utilizados. Además, estas funciones tienen ventajas computacionales, principalmente debido a la capacidad de reutilizar muchos de sus componentes al calcular el valor de reserva óptimo en los modelos de búsqueda económicos. También se ajustan bien a los parámetros que la CA está tratando de estimar en dominios de ritmo rápido, porque estos parámetros están en su mayoría influenciados por actividades en las que el usuario está involucrado. El sistema Testbed nos permitió definir funciones de distribución multidrectangulares hechas a mano o generadas automáticamente. En cada paso de una simulación, cada una de las muestras de CAS su propietario (es decir, todos los CA en el sistema recopilan datos a una velocidad similar) y luego estima el parámetro (ya sea el costo esperado cuando se usa la técnica de interrupción secuencial descrita en la Sección 2 oLa probabilidad de que el propietario tenga la información requerida) utilizando uno de los siguientes métodos: (a) confiar únicamente en los datos de observación directa (autoaprendizaje);(b) confiar en los datos combinados de todos los demás agentes (promedio de todos);y, (c) confiar en sus propios datos y porciones selectivas de los datos de otros agentes basados en el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo descrito en la Sección 3. 5. Resultados Presentamos los resultados en dos partes: (1) utilizando un entorno de muestra específico para ilustrar el comportamiento básico del mecanismo selectivo;y (2) usar entornos generales que se generaron automáticamente.206 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de agentes múltiples (AAMAS 07) 5.1 Entorno de muestra para ilustrar la ganancia obtenida utilizando el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo, utilizamos un entorno de 10 agentes, asociado con 5 diferentes tipos de funciones de distribución de costos de interrupción. La tabla de la Figura 4 detalla la división de los 10 agentes en tipos, las dimensiones de los rectángulos que forman las funciones de distribución, y la media teórica y el valor de reserva (RV) (después de la ecuación 3) con un costo C = 2 para detectar elCosto de interrupción. Aunque los medios de los cinco tipos son relativamente similares, el uso de una estrategia de interrupción basada en el valor de reserva produce costos de interrupción esperados relativamente diferentes (RV, después de la ecuación 2). El histograma en esta figura muestra el número de observaciones obtenidas para cada contenedor de tamaño 1 de una muestra de 100000 observaciones tomadas de la función de distribución de cada tipo.

Cada gráfico presenta la precisión de predicción promedio (en términos de la desviación absoluta del valor teórico, por lo que cuanto menor sea la curva, mejor será el rendimiento) de un tipo diferente, basado en las ejecuciones de simulación de 10000. Las tres curvas en cada gráfico representan los métodos que se están comparando (autodeclaración, promedio todos y compartir selectivo). Los datos se dan en función del número acumulado de observaciones recopiladas. El sexto gráfico de la figura es el promedio de todos los tipos, ponderado según el número de agentes de cada tipo. Del mismo modo, la siguiente tabla resume el rendimiento promedio general en términos de la desviación absoluta del valor teórico de cada uno de los diferentes métodos: iteraciones de autoaprendizaje promedio-todo Selectivo compartido % Mejora3 5 20.08 8.70 9.51 53 % 15 12.62 7.84 8.14 36 36 36 36 36% 40 8.16 7.42 6.35 22% Tabla 1: Error absoluto promedio A lo largo del tiempo Se pueden hacer varias observaciones de la Figura 5. Primero, aunque el método promedio de todo puede producir resultados relativamente buenos, rápidamente alcanza el estancamiento, mientras que los otros dos métodos exhiben una mejora continua en función de la cantidad de datos acumulados. Para el entorno de la Figura 4, el promedio de todo es una buena estrategia para los agentes de tipo II, IV y V, porque el valor de reserva teórico de cada uno de estos tipos está cerca de la obtenida en función de la función de distribución agregada (es decir, 21.27).4 Sin embargo, para los tipos I y III para los cuales el RV óptimo difiere de ese valor, el método promedio de todo funciona significativamente peor. En general, el sexto gráfico y la tabla anterior muestran que, si bien en este entorno específico, el método promedio de todo funciona bien en las primeras interacciones, 3 la mejora se mide en porcentajes en relación con el método de autoaprendizaje.4 El valor se obtiene construyendo la función distribuida agregada ponderada de acuerdo con los diferentes tipos de agentes y extrayendo la RV óptima usando la ecuación 3. 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 16 26 26 36 Tipo I 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 16 11 16 21 26 31 36 36 Selective compartir el promedio de auto-aprendizaje Todo 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 36 Tipo II 0 8 16 24 32 40 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 36 Tipo III 0 4 8 1216 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 26 31 36 Tipo IV 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Tipo V 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 16 26 31 36 Promedio ponderado Figura 5: Desviación absoluta promedioDesde el RV teórico en cada método (10000 ejecuciones) se supera rápidamente por el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo. Además, cuantas más observaciones de los usuarios acumulan (es decir, a medida que extendemos el eje horizontal), mejor sean los otros dos métodos en comparación con el promedio de todos. A largo plazo (y como se muestra en la siguiente subsección para el caso general), el método promedio de todo exhibe el peor rendimiento. En segundo lugar, el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo comienza con una mejora significativa en comparación con depender de las propias observaciones de los agentes, y luego esta mejora disminuye gradualmente hasta que finalmente su curva de rendimiento coincide con la curva de métodos de autoaprendizaje. El mecanismo de intercambio selectivo funciona mejor o peor, dependiendo del tipo, porque la prueba de Wilcoxon no puede garantizar una identificación exacta de similitud;Las diferentes combinaciones de la función de distribución pueden dar lugar a una incapacidad para identificar exactamente a los usuarios similares para algunos de los tipos específicos. Por ejemplo, para los agentes tipo I, el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo en realidad funciona peor que el autoaprendizaje a corto plazo (a largo plazo, los dos métodos convergen el rendimiento). Sin embargo, para los otros tipos en nuestro ejemplo, el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo es el más eficiente y supera a los otros dos métodos en general. En tercer lugar, es notable que para los agentes que tienen un tipo único (por ejemplo, Agente III), el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo converge rápidamente para confiar en los datos autocollectados. Este comportamiento garantiza que incluso en escenarios en los que los usuarios son completamente diferentes, el método exhibe una degradación inicial elegante pero administra, en unos pocos pasos, adoptar el comportamiento adecuado de contar exclusivamente en datos autogenerados. Por último, a pesar de la diferencia en su función de distribución general, los agentes de Tipo IV y V exhiben un rendimiento similar porque la parte relevante de sus funciones de distribución (es decir, las partes efectivas que afectan el cálculo de RV como se explica en la Figura 1) es idéntica. Por lo tanto, el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo permite que el agente del tipo V, a pesar de su función de distribución única, adopte información relevante recopilada por agentes de los tipos IV, lo que mejora su estimación del costo de interrupción esperado.5.2 Evaluación general Para evaluar el intercambio selectivo, ejecutamos una serie de simulaciones en las que el entorno se generó aleatoriamente. Estos experimentos se centraron en las estimaciones CAS de la probabilidad de que el usuario tenga la información requerida si se interrumpe. Utilizaron una función de distribución de probabilidad multirrectangular para representar el sexto INTL. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 207 La cantidad de comunicación en la que se dedica el usuario a su entorno. Modelamos el crecimiento de la probabilidad que el usuario tenga la información requerida en función de la cantidad de comunicación utilizando la función logística, 5 g (x) = 1 + e −x 12 1 + 60E −x 12.(7) El valor esperado (media) del parámetro que representa la probabilidad que el usuario tenga la información requerida es, por lo tanto, μ = z ∞ y = 0 g (y) f (y) dy = kx i = 1 hx + 708ln (60 +E x 12) Pi 60 (xi - xi - 1) ixi xi - 1 (8) donde k es el número de rectángulos utilizados. Ejecutamos 10000 corridas de simulación. Para cada simulación, el sistema generó automáticamente un nuevo entorno de 20 agentes, y los agentes se dividieron aleatoriamente en un número aleatorio de diferentes tipos.6 Para cada tipo, se generó una función de distribución de 3 rectángulos aleatorias. Cada simulación corrió 40 pasos de tiempo. En cada paso de tiempo, cada uno de los agentes acumuló una observación adicional. Cada CA calculó una estimación de la probabilidad de que su usuario tuviera la información necesaria de acuerdo con los tres métodos, y se registró el error absoluto (diferencia del valor teórico calculado según la Ecuación 8). La siguiente tabla resume el rendimiento promedio de los tres mecanismos a lo largo de diferentes horizontes temporales (medidos en 5, 15 y 40 pasos de tiempo): iteraciones Autoaprendizaje promedio: todo el sharing sharing % mejora 5 0.176 0.099 0.103 41.4 % 15 0.115 0.088 0.087 23.9.9.9% 40 0.075 0.082 0.065 13.6% Tabla 2: Error absoluto promedio A lo largo de los pasos de tiempo como se puede ver en la tabla anterior, el método de intercambio selectivo propuesto supera los otros dos métodos sobre cualquier ejecución en el que se recopilen más de 15 observaciones de cada uno delos agentes. Como en el entorno de muestra, el método promedio de todo funciona bien en los pasos de tiempo iniciales, pero no exhibe una mejora adicional. Por lo tanto, cuanto más datos recopilados, mayor es la diferencia entre este último método y los otros dos métodos. La diferencia promedio entre el intercambio selectivo y el autoaprendizaje disminuye a medida que se recopilan más datos. Finalmente, medimos el efecto del número de tipos en el medio ambiente. Para este propósito, utilizamos el mismo método de autogeneración, pero controlamos el número de tipos generados para cada ejecución. El número de tipos es una buena indicación del nivel de heterogeneidad en el medio ambiente. Para cada número de tipos, ejecutamos 10000 simulaciones. La Figura 6 muestra el rendimiento de los diferentes métodos (para un período de recolección de 40 observación para cada agente). Dado que todas las ejecuciones de simulación utilizadas para generar la Figura 6 se basan en la misma semilla, el rendimiento del mecanismo de autoaprendizaje es constante independientemente del número de tipos en el entorno. Como se esperaba, el mecanismo promedio de todo funciona mejor cuando todos los agentes son del mismo tipo;Sin embargo, su rendimiento se deteriora a medida que aumenta el número de tipos. Del mismo modo, el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo exhibe buenos resultados cuando todos los agentes son del mismo tipo, y a medida que aumenta el número de tipos, su rendimiento se deteriora. Sin embargo, la disminución del rendimiento es significativamente más modesta en comparación con la experimentada en el mecanismo promedio de todo.5 Los coeficientes específicos utilizados garantizan una curva de crecimiento similar a S, a lo largo del intervalo (0, 100), donde la etapa inicial de crecimiento es aproximadamente exponencial, seguida de un crecimiento asintóticamente desacelerado.6 En este esquema de generación de entorno sugerido no hay garantía de que cada agente tenga un agente similar potencial para compartir información. En aquellos escenarios no raros en los que la CA es la única de su tipo, rápidamente necesitará dejar de confiar en los demás.0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 1 2 3 4 5 Auto aprendizaje promedio All Selective Compartir Número de tipos AverageBeBsoluteError Figura 6: Desviación absoluta promedio del valor real en 20 escenarios de agentes en función del nivel de heterogeneidad de los agentes en general, el intercambio selectivo en general, el intercambio selectivoEl mecanismo supera a los otros métodos para cualquier número de tipos mayores que uno.6. Trabajo relacionado Además de la literatura de gestión de interrupciones revisadas en la Sección 2, varias otras áreas de trabajo previo son relevantes para el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo descrito en este documento. El filtrado colaborativo, que hace predicciones (filtrado) sobre los intereses de un usuario [7], funciona de manera similar al intercambio selectivo. Sin embargo, los sistemas de filtrado colaborativo exhiben un bajo rendimiento cuando no hay suficiente información sobre los usuarios y cuando no hay información suficiente sobre un nuevo usuario cuyo gusto el sistema intenta predecir [7]. El intercambio selectivo se basa en la capacidad de encontrar similitud entre partes específicas de la función de distribución de probabilidad asociada con una característica de diferentes usuarios. Esta capacidad está estrechamente relacionada con la agrupación y la clasificación, un área ampliamente estudiada en el aprendizaje automático. Dadas las consideraciones de espacio, nuestra revisión de esta área está restringida a algunos enfoques representativos para la agrupación. A pesar de la riqueza de los algoritmos de agrupación disponibles (como el famoso algoritmo de agrupamiento de K-means [11], los métodos jerárquicos, los clasificadores bayesianos [6] y la máxima entropía), varias características de dominios de ritmo rápido no se alinean bien con los bien con losCaracterísticas de los mecanismos de agrupación basados en atributos, lo que sugiere que estos mecanismos no funcionarían bien en tales dominios. De particular importancia es que la CA necesita encontrar similitud entre las funciones, definidas en un intervalo continuo, sin atributos predefinidos distintos. Una dificultad adicional es definir la medida de distancia. Se han utilizado muchas técnicas de agrupación en la minería de datos [2], con un enfoque particular en actualizaciones incrementales de la agrupación, debido al gran tamaño de las bases de datos [3]. Sin embargo, la aplicabilidad de estos a dominios de ritmo rápido es bastante limitada porque dependen de un gran conjunto de datos existentes. Del mismo modo, los algoritmos de agrupación diseñados para la tarea de identificación de clase en bases de datos espaciales (por ejemplo, depender de una noción basada en densidad [4]) no son útiles para nuestro caso, porque nuestros datos no tienen atributos espaciales. El método más relevante para nuestros propósitos es el índice de entropía relativa Kullback-Leibbler que se utiliza en la teoría de la probabilidad y la teoría de la información [12]. Esta medida, que también se puede aplicar en variables aleatorias continuas, se basa en una medida de distancia natural desde una distribución de probabilidad verdadera (ya sea basada en la observación o calculada) a una distribución de probabilidad arbitraria. Sin embargo, el método funcionará mal en escenarios en los que las funciones se alternan entre diferentes niveles mientras mantienen la estructura general y los momentos. Por ejemplo, considere las dos funciones f (x) = (x mod2)/100 y g (x) = (x mod2)/100 definidas durante el intervalo (0, 200). Si bien estas dos funciones están asociadas con valores de reserva casi idénticos (para cualquier costo de muestreo) y media, el método Kullback-Leiber asignará una correlación deficiente entre 208 el Sexto INTL. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) ellos, mientras que nuestro enfoque basado en Wilcoxon les dará el rango más alto en términos de similitud. Si bien la prueba de Wilcoxon es un procedimiento estadístico ampliamente utilizado [22, 14], generalmente se usa para comparar dos conjuntos de datos de un solo variado. Hasta donde sabemos, aún no se ha intentado extender sus propiedades como una infraestructura para determinar con quién y en qué medida la información debe compartirse, como se presenta en este documento. El uso típico de esta herramienta no paramétrica incluye la detección de eventos raros en las series de tiempo (por ejemplo, una predicción de falla del disco duro [17]) y aplicaciones bioinformáticas (por ejemplo, encontrar genes informativos a partir de datos de microarrays). En estas aplicaciones, se utiliza principalmente como una herramienta de identificación y criterio de clasificación.7. Discusión y conclusiones El mecanismo de intercambio selectivo presentado en este documento no hace ninguna suposición sobre el formato de los datos utilizados o sobre la estructura de la función de distribución del parámetro a estimar. Es computacionalmente liviano y muy simple de ejecutar. El intercambio selectivo permite que un agente se beneficie de las observaciones de otros agentes en escenarios en los que están disponibles fuentes de datos del mismo tipo. También garantiza, como un respaldo, un rendimiento equivalente al de un autoaprendedor cuando la fuente de información es única. Además, el intercambio selectivo no requiere ningún conocimiento previo sobre los tipos de fuentes de información disponibles en el entorno o sobre el número de agentes asociados con cada tipo. Los resultados de nuestras simulaciones demuestran la efectividad de los mecanismos de intercambio selectivos para mejorar la estimación producida para los parámetros probabilísticos basados en un conjunto limitado de observaciones. Además, la mayor parte de la mejora se logra en las interacciones iniciales, lo cual es de gran importancia para los agentes que operan en entornos de ritmo rápido. Aunque probamos el mecanismo de intercambio selectivo en el contexto del proyecto Coordinators, es aplicable en cualquier entorno MAS que tenga las características de un entorno de ritmo rápido (por ejemplo, entornos de rescate). La evidencia de su efectividad general se proporciona en la sección de evaluación general, donde los entornos se generaron continuamente al azar. La estadística de Wilcoxon utilizada como se describe en este documento para proporcionar un clasificador para la similitud entre los usuarios proporciona una alta flexibilidad con bajos costos computacionales y es aplicable para cualquier característica que se aprenda. Su uso proporciona una buena medida de similitud que un agente puede usar para decidir cuánta información externa adoptar para sus evaluaciones.8.

Grosz School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Harvard University, Cambridge MA 02138 USA {sarned,grosz}@eecs.harvard.edu ABSTRACT This paper investigates the problem of estimating the value of probabilistic parameters needed for decision making in environments in which an agent, operating within a multi-agent system, has no a priori information about the structure of the distribution of parameter values.",
        "The agent must be able to produce estimations even when it may have made only a small number of direct observations, and thus it must be able to operate with sparse data.",
        "The paper describes a mechanism that enables the agent to significantly improve its estimation by augmenting its direct observations with those obtained by other agents with which it is coordinating.",
        "To avoid undesirable bias in relatively heterogeneous environments while effectively using relevant data to improve its estimations, the mechanism weighs the contributions of other agents observations based on a real-time estimation of the level of similarity between each of these agents and itself.",
        "The coordination autonomy module of a coordination-manager system provided an empirical setting for evaluation.",
        "Simulation-based evaluations demonstrated that the proposed mechanism outperforms estimations based exclusively on an agents own observations as well as estimations based on an unweighted aggregate of all other agents observations.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.6 [Artificial Intelligence]: Learning-Parameter learning; I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Intelligent agents, Multiagent systems; G.3 [Mathematics of Computing]: Probability and Statistics-Distribution functions General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION For many real-world scenarios, autonomous agents need to operate in dynamic, uncertain environments in which they have only incomplete information about the results of their actions and characteristics of other agents or people with whom they need to cooperate or collaborate.",
        "In such environments, agents can benefit from sharing information they gather, pooling their individual experiences to improve their estimations of unknown parameters required for reasoning about actions under uncertainty.",
        "This paper addresses the problem of learning the distribution of the values of a probabilistic parameter that represents a characteristic of a person who is interacting with a computer agent.",
        "The characteristic to be learned is (or is clearly related to) an important factor in the agents decision making.1 The basic setting we consider is one in which an agent accumulates observations about a specific user characteristic and uses them to produce a timely estimate of some measure that depends on that characteristics distribution.",
        "The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames.",
        "Typically, agents must make decisions in real time, concurrent with task execution, and in the midst of great uncertainty.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we use the term fast-paced to refer to such environments.",
        "In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions.",
        "Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.",
        "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
        "That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",
        "In such environments, an agents individually acquired data (its own observations) are too sparse for it to obtain good estimations in the requisite time frame.",
        "Given the no-structure-constraint of the environment, approaches that depend on structured distributions may result in a significantly high estimation bias.",
        "We consider this problem in the context of a multi-agent distributed system in which computer agents support people who are carrying out complex tasks in a dynamic environment.",
        "The fact that agents are part of a multi-agent setting, in which other agents may 1 Learning the distribution rather than just determining some value in the distribution is important whenever the overall shape of the distribution and not just such individual features as mean are important. also be gathering data to estimate a similar characteristic of their users, offers the possibility for an agent to augment its own observations with those of other agents, thus improving the accuracy of its learning process.",
        "Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate.",
        "Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given agent depends on the extent to which their users characteristics distributions are correlated with that of this agents user.",
        "There is no guarantee that the distribution for two different agents is highly, positively correlated, let alone that they are the same.",
        "Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a learning mechanism must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation.",
        "The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work.",
        "However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-agent settings in which agents are collecting data that overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets).",
        "In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual parameters they need for their decision-making.",
        "In this paper, we present a mechanism that was used for learning key user characteristics in fast-paced environments.",
        "The mechanism provides relatively accurate estimations within short time frames by augmenting an individual agents direct observations with observations obtained by other agents with which it is coordinating.",
        "In particular, we focus on the related problems of estimating the cost of interrupting a person and estimating the probability that that person will have the information required by the system.",
        "Our adaptive approach, which we will refer to throughout the paper as selective-sharing, allows our CA to improve the accuracy of its distribution-based estimations in comparison to relying only on the interactions with a specific user (subsequently, self-learning) or pooling all data unconditionally (average all), in particular when the number of available observations is relatively small.",
        "The mechanism was successfully tested using a system that simulates a Coordinators environment.",
        "The next section of the paper describes the problem of estimating user-related parameters in fastpaced domains.",
        "Section 3 provides an overview of the methods we developed.",
        "The implementation, empirical setting, and results are given in Sections 4 and 5.",
        "A comparison with related methods is given in Section 6 and conclusions in section 7. 2.",
        "PARAMETER ESTIMATION IN FASTPACED DOMAINS The CA module and algorithms we describe in this paper were developed and tested in the Coordinators domain [21].",
        "In this domain, autonomous agents, called Coordinators, are intended to help maximize an overall team objective by handling changes in the task schedule as conditions of operation change.",
        "Each agent operates on behalf of its owner (e.g., the team leader of a firstresponse team or a unit commander) whose schedule it manages.",
        "Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by owners or by units they oversee, and the agents responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners).",
        "In this domain, scheduling information and constraints are distributed.",
        "Each agent receives a different view of the tasks and structures that constitute the full multi-agent problem-typically only a partial, local one.",
        "Schedule revisions that affect more than one agent must be coordinated, so agents thus must share certain kinds of information. (In a team context they may be designed to share other types as well.)",
        "However, the fast-paced nature of the domain constrains the amount of information they can share, precluding a centralized solution; scheduling problems must be solved distributively.",
        "The agent-owner relationship is a collaborative one, with the agent needing to interact with its owner to obtain task and environment information relevant to scheduling.",
        "The CA module is responsible for deciding intelligently when and how to interact with the owner for improving the agents scheduling.",
        "As a result, the CA must estimate the expected benefit of any such interaction and the cost associated with it [19].",
        "In general, the net benefit of a potential interaction is PV − C, where V is the value of the information the user may have, P is the probability that the user has this information, and C is the cost associated with an interaction.",
        "The values of P, V , and C are time-varying, and the CA estimates their value at the intended time of initiating the interaction with its owner.",
        "This paper focuses on the twin problems of estimating the parameters P and C, both of which are user-centric in the sense of being determined by characteristics of the owner and the environment in which the owner is operating); it presumes a mechanism for determining V [18]. 2.1 Estimating Interruption Costs The cost of interrupting owners derives from the potential degradation in performance of tasks they are doing caused by the disruption [1; 9, inter alia].",
        "Research on interaction management has deployed sensor-based statistical models of human interruptibility to infer the degree of distraction likely to be caused by an interruption.",
        "This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying interruptions to times that are convenient.",
        "It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a users current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions.",
        "By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the users attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a users attention and intentions [9].",
        "Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5].",
        "Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions.",
        "First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider.",
        "Second, the interruptibility-estimation models are task-based.",
        "Lastly, it relies on continuous monitoring of a users activities.",
        "In fast-paced environments, there usually is no single task structure, and some of the activities themselves may have little internal structure.",
        "As a result, it is difficult to determine the actual attentional state of agent-owners [15].",
        "In such settings, owners must make complex decisions that typically involve a number of other members of their units, while remaining reactive to events that diverge from expectations [24].",
        "For instance, during disaster rescue, a first-response unit may begin rescuing survivors trapped in a burning house, when a wall collapses suddenly, forcing the unit to The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 203 retract and re-plan their actions.",
        "Prior work has tracked users focus of attention using a range of devices, including those able to monitor gestures [8] and track eyegaze to identify focus of visual attention [13, 20], thus enabling estimations of cognitive load and physical indicators of performance degradation.",
        "The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors.",
        "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
        "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
        "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",
        "Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.",
        "The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem.",
        "The CAs cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owners interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized.",
        "In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or maximize expected utility.",
        "The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function.",
        "We use a sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages.",
        "The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn.",
        "In particular, we consider the situation in which an agents owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x).",
        "The agent can activate sensing devices to get an estimation of the interruption cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of operating the sensing devices for a single time unit.",
        "The CA module sets a reservation value and as long as the sensor-based observation x is greater than this reservation value, the CA will wait and re-sample the user for a new estimation.",
        "The expected cost, V (xrv), using such a strategy with reservation value xrv is described by Equation 1, V (xrv) = c + R xrv y=0 yf(y) F(xrv) , (1) which decomposes into two parts.",
        "The first part, c divided by F(xrv), represents the expected sampling cost.",
        "The second, the integral divided by F(xrv), represents the expected cost of interruption, because the expected number of search cycles is (random) geometric and the probability of success is F(xrv).",
        "Taking the derivative of the left-hand-side of Equation 1 and equating it to zero, yields the characteristics of the optimal reservation value, namely x∗ rv must satisfy, V (x∗ rv) = x∗ rv. (2) Substituting (2) in Equation 1 yields Equation 3 (after integration by parts) from which the optimal reservation value, x∗ rv, and consequently (from Equation 2) V (x∗ rv) can be computed. c = Z x∗ rv y=0 F(y) (3) This method, which depends on extracting the optimal sequence of sensor-based user sampling, relies heavily on the structure of the distribution function, f(x).",
        "However, we need only a portion of the distribution function, namely from the origin to the reservation value. (See Equation 1 and Figure 1.)",
        "Thus, when we consider sharing data, it is not necessary to rely on complete similarity in the distribution function of different users.",
        "For some parameters, including the users interruptibility level, it is enough to rely on similarity in the relevant portion of the distribution function.",
        "The implementation described in Sections 4-5 relies on this fact.",
        "Figure 1: The distribution structure affecting the expected costs calculation 2.2 Estimating the Probability of Having Information One way an agent can estimate the probability a user will have information it needs (e.g., will know at a specific interruption time, with some level of reliability, the actual outcome of a task currently being executed) is to rely on prior interactions with this user, calculating the ratio between the number of times the user had the information and the total number of interactions.",
        "Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption.",
        "This indirect approach, which does not require interrupting the user, is especially useful in fast-paced domains.",
        "The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method: ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information.",
        "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",
        "Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.",
        "Given occasional updates about its owners level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs.",
        "Denoting the probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy. (4) 204 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The more observations an agent can accumulate about the distribution of the frequency of an owners interaction with the environment at a given time, the better it can estimate the probability the owner has the information needed by the system. 3.",
        "THE SELECTIVE-SHARING MECHANISM This section presents the selective-sharing mechanism by which the CA learns the distribution function of a probabilistic parameter by taking advantage of data collected by other CAs in its environment.",
        "We first explain the need for increasing the number of observations used as the basis of estimation and then present a method for determining how much data to adopt from other agents.",
        "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
        "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
        "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",
        "For example, Figure 2 illustrates the reservation-value-based cost calculated according to observations received from an owner with a uniform interruption cost distribution U(0, 100) as a function of the number of accumulated observations used for generating the distribution histogram. (In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5).",
        "Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function.",
        "Eventually this method yields a very accurate estimation for the expected interruption cost.",
        "However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value.",
        "This error could seriously degrade the CAs decision making process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions.",
        "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",
        "One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents.",
        "Such an approach depends on identifying other owners with distribution functions for the characteristic of interest similar to the CAs owner.",
        "This dataaugmentation idea is simple: different owners may exhibit similar basic behaviors or patterns in similar fast-paced task scenarios.",
        "Since they are all coordinating on a common overall task and are operating in the same environment, it is reasonable to assume some level of similarity in the distribution function of their modeled parameters.",
        "People vary in their behavior, so, obviously, there may be different types of owners: some will emphasize communication with their teams, and some will spend more time on map-based planning; some will dislike being disturbed while trying to evaluate their teams progress, while others may be more open to interruptions.",
        "Consequently, an owners CA is likely to be able to find some CAs that are working with owners who are similar to its owner.",
        "When adopting data collected by other agents, the two main questions are which agents the CA should rely on and to what extent it should rely on each of them.",
        "The selective-sharing mechanism relies on a statistical measure of similarity that allows the CA of any specific user to identify the similarity between its owner and other owners dynamically.",
        "Based on this similarity level, the CA decides if and to what degree to import other CAs data in order to augment its direct observations, and thus to enable better modeling of its owners characteristics.",
        "It is notable that the cost of transferring observations between different CA modules of different agents is relatively small.",
        "This information can be transferred as part of regular negotiation communication between agents.",
        "The volume of such communication is negligible: it involves just the transmission of new observations values.",
        "In our learning mechanism, the CA constantly updates its estimation of the level of similarity between its owner and the owners represented by other CAs in the environment.",
        "Each new observation obtained either by that CA or any of the other CAs updates this estimation.",
        "The similarity level is determined using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Subsection 3.1).",
        "Whenever it is necessary to produce a parameter estimate, the CA decides on the number of additional observations it intends to rely on for extracting its estimation.",
        "The number of additional observations to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the similarity between its owner and other owners.",
        "In most cases, the number of observations the CA will want to take from another agent is smaller than the overall number of observations the other agent has; thus, it randomly samples (without repetitions) the required number of observations from this other agents database.",
        "The additional observations the CA takes from other agents are used only to model its owners characteristics.",
        "Future similarity level determination is not affected by this information augmentation procedure. 3.1 The Wilcoxon Test We use a nonparametric method (i.e., one that makes no assumptions about the parametric form of the distributions each set is drawn from), because user characteristics in fast-paced domains do not have the structure needed for parametric approaches.",
        "Two additional advantages of a non-parametric approach are their usefulness for dealing with unexpected, outlying observations (possibly problematic for a parametric approach), and the fact that non-parametric approaches are computationally very simple and thus ideal for settings in which computational resources are scarce.",
        "The Wilcoxon rank-sum test we use is a nonparametric alternative to the two-sample t-test [22, 14]2 .",
        "While the t-test compares means, the Wilcoxon test can be used to test the null hypothesis that two populations X and Y have the same continuous distribution.",
        "We assume that we have independent random samples {x1, x2, ..., xm} and {y1, y2, ..., yn}, of sizes m and n respectively, from each population.",
        "We then merge the data and rank each measurement from lowest to highest.",
        "All sequences of ties are assigned an average rank.",

        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 205 sample, we calculate the test statistic and extract the level of confidence for rejecting the null hypothesis.",
        "This level of confidence becomes the measure for the level of similarity between the two owners.",
        "The Wilcoxon test does not require that the data originates from a normally distributed population or that the distribution is characterized by a finite set of parameters. 3.2 Determining Required Information Correctly identifying the right number of additional observations to gather is a key determinant of success of the selective-sharing mechanism.",
        "Obviously, if the CA can identify another owner who has identical characteristics to the owner it represents, then it should use all of the observations collected by that owners agent.",
        "However, cases of identical matches are likely to be very uncommon.",
        "Furthermore, even to establish that another user is identical to its own, the CA would need substantial sample sizes to have a relatively high level of confidence.",
        "Thus, usually the CA needs to decide how much to rely on another agents data while estimating various levels of similarity with a changing level of confidence.",
        "At the beginning of its process, the selective-sharing mechanism has almost no data to rely on, and thus no similarity measure can be used.",
        "In this case, the CA module relies heavily on other agents, in the expectation that all owners have some basic level of similarity in their distribution (see Section 2).",
        "As the number of its direct observations increases, the CA module refines the number of additional observations required.",
        "Again, there are two conflicting effects.",
        "On one hand, the more data the CA has, the better it can determine its level of confidence in the similarity ratings it has for other owners.",
        "On the other hand, assuming there is some difference among owners (even if not noticed yet), as the number of its direct observations increases, the owners own data should gain weight in its analysis.",
        "Therefore, when CAi decides how many additional observations, Oi j should be adopted from CAjs database, it calculates Oi j as follows: Oi j = N ∗ (1 − αi,j) √ N + 2 + ln(N) N (5) where N is the number of observations CAi already has (which is similar in magnitude to the number of observations CAj has) and αi,j is the confidence of rejecting the Wilcoxon null hypothesis.",
        "The function in Equation 5 ensures that the number of additional observations to be taken from another CA module increases as the confidence in the similarity with the source for these additional observations increases.",
        "At the same time, it ensures that the level of dependency on external observations decreases as the number of direct observations increases.",
        "When calculating the parameter αi,j, we always perform the test over the interval relevant to the originating CAs distribution function.",
        "For example, when estimating the cost of interrupting the user, we apply the Wilcoxon test only for observations in the interval that starts from zero and ends slightly to the right of the formerly estimated RV (see Figure 1). 4.",
        "EMPIRICAL SETTING We tested the selective-sharing mechanism in a system that simulates a distributed, Coordinators-like MAS.",
        "This testbed environment includes a variable number of agents, each corresponding to a single CA module.",
        "Each agent is assigned an external source (simulating an owner) which it periodically samples to obtain a value from the distribution being estimated.",
        "The simulation system enabled us to avoid unnecessary inter-agent scheduling and communication overhead (which are an inherent part of the Coordinators environment) and thus to better isolate the performance and effectiveness of the estimation and decision-making mechanisms.",
        "The distribution functions used in the experiments (i.e., the distribution functions assigned to each user in the simulated environment) are multi-rectangular shaped.",
        "This type of function is ideal for representing empirical distribution functions.",
        "It is composed of k rectangles, where each rectangle i is defined over the interval (xi−1, xi), and represents a probability pi, ( Pk i=1 pi =1).",
        "For any value x in rectangle i, we can formulate F(x) and f(x) as: f(x) = pi xi − xi−1 F(x) = i−1X j=1 pj + (x − xi−1)pi xi − xi−1 (6) For example, the multi-rectangular function in Figure 3 depicts a possible interruption cost distribution for a specific user.",
        "Each rectangle is associated with one of the users typical activities, characterized by a set of typical interruption costs. (We assume the distribution of cost within each activity is uniform.)",
        "The rectangular area represents the probability of the user being engaged in this type of activity when she is randomly interrupted.",
        "Any overlap between the interruption costs of two or more activities results in a new rectangle for the overlapped interval.",
        "The user associated with the above distribution function spends most of her time in reporting (notice that this is the largest rectangle in terms of area), an activity associated with a relatively high cost of interruption.",
        "The user also spends a large portion of her time in planning (associated with a very high cost of interruption), monitoring his team (with a relatively small interruption cost) and receiving reports (mid-level cost of interruption).",
        "The user spends a relatively small portion of her time in scouting the enemy (associated with relatively high interruption cost) and resting.",
        "Figure 3: Representing interruption cost distribution using a multi-rectangular function Multi-rectangular functions are modular and allow the representation of any distribution shape by controlling the number and dimensions of the rectangles used.",
        "Furthermore, these functions have computational advantages, mostly due to the ability to re-use many of their components when calculating the optimal reservation value in economical search models.",
        "They also fit well the parameters the CA is trying to estimate in fast-paced domains, because these parameters are mostly influenced by activities in which the user is engaged.",
        "The testbed system enabled us to define either hand-crafted or automatically generated multi-rectangular distribution functions.",
        "At each step of a simulation, each of the CAs samples its owner (i.e., all CAs in the system collect data at a similar rate) and then estimates the parameter (either the expected cost when using the sequential interruption technique described in Section 2 or the probability that the owner will have the required information) using one of the following methods: (a) relying solely on direct observation (self-learning) data; (b) relying on the combined data of all other agents (average all); and, (c) relying on its own data and selective portions of the other agents data based on the selective-sharing mechanism described in Section 3. 5.",

        "First, although the average-all method may produce relatively good results, it quickly reaches stagnation, while the other two methods exhibit continuous improvement as a function of the amount of accumulated data.",
        "For the Figure 4 environment, average-all is a good strategy for agents of type II, IV and V, because the theoretical reservation value of each of these types is close to the one obtained based on the aggregated distribution function (i.e., 21.27).4 However, for types I and III for which the optimal RV differs from that value, the average-all method performs significantly worse.",
        "Overall, the sixth graph and the table above show that while in this specific environment the average-all method works well in the first interactions, it 3 The improvement is measured in percentages relative to the self-learning method. 4 The value is obtained by constructing the weighted aggregated distributed function according to the different agents types and extracting the optimal RV using Equation 3. 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Type I 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 selective sharing self-learning average all 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Type II 0 8 16 24 32 40 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Type III 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Type IV 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Type V 0 4 8 12 16 20 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 Weighted Average Figure 5: Average absolute deviation from the theoretical RV in each method (10000 runs) is quickly outperformed by the selective-sharing mechanism.",
        "Furthermore, the more user observations the agents accumulate (i.e., as we extend the horizontal axis), the better the other two methods are in comparison to average-all.",
        "In the long run (and as shown in the following subsection for the general case), the average-all method exhibits the worst performance.",
        "Second, the selective-sharing mechanism starts with a significant improvement in comparison to relying on the agents own observations, and then this improvement gradually decreases until finally its performance curve coincides with the self-learning methods curve.",
        "The selective-sharing mechanism performs better or worse, depending on the type, because the Wilcoxon test cannot guarantee an exact identification of similarity; different combinations of distribution function can result in an inability to exactly identify the similar users for some of the specific types.",
        "For example, for type I agents, the selective-sharing mechanism actually performs worse than self-learning in the short term (in the long run the two methods performance converge).",
        "Nevertheless, for the other types in our example, the selective-sharing mechanism is the most efficient one, and outperforms the other two methods overall.",
        "Third, it is notable that for agents that have a unique type (e.g., agent III), the selective-sharing mechanism quickly converges towards relying on self-collected data.",
        "This behavior guarantees that even in scenarios in which users are completely different, the method exhibits a graceful initial degradation but manages, within a few time steps, to adopt the proper behavior of counting exclusively on self-generated data.",
        "Last, despite the difference in their overall distribution function, agents of type IV and V exhibit similar performance because the relevant portion of their distribution functions (i.e., the effective parts that affect the RV calculation as explained in Figure 1) is identical.",
        "Thus, the selective-sharing mechanism enables the agent of type V, despite its unique distribution function, to adopt relevant information collected by agents of types IV which improves its estimation of the expected interruption cost. 5.2 General Evaluation To evaluate selective-sharing, we ran a series of simulations in which the environment was randomly generated.",

                "The characteristic to be learned is (or is clearly related to) an important factor in the agents decision making.1 The basic setting we consider is one in which an agent accumulates observations about a specific user characteristic and uses them to produce a timely estimate of some measure that depends on that characteristics distribution.",
                "The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames.",
                "Typically, agents must make decisions in real time, concurrent with task execution, and in the midst of great uncertainty.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we use the term fast-paced to refer to such environments.",
                "In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions.",
                "Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.",
                "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
                "That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",
                "In such environments, an agents individually acquired data (its own observations) are too sparse for it to obtain good estimations in the requisite time frame.",

                "Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate.",
                "Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given agent depends on the extent to which their users characteristics distributions are correlated with that of this agents user.",
                "There is no guarantee that the distribution for two different agents is highly, positively correlated, let alone that they are the same.",
                "Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a learning mechanism must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation.",
                "The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work.",
                "However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-agent settings in which agents are collecting data that overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets).",
                "In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual parameters they need for their decision-making.",

                "Each agent operates on behalf of its owner (e.g., the team leader of a firstresponse team or a unit commander) whose schedule it manages.",
                "Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by owners or by units they oversee, and the agents responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners).",
                "In this domain, scheduling information and constraints are distributed.",
                "Each agent receives a different view of the tasks and structures that constitute the full multi-agent problem-typically only a partial, local one.",
                "Schedule revisions that affect more than one agent must be coordinated, so agents thus must share certain kinds of information. (In a team context they may be designed to share other types as well.)",
                "However, the fast-paced nature of the domain constrains the amount of information they can share, precluding a centralized solution; scheduling problems must be solved distributively.",
                "The agent-owner relationship is a collaborative one, with the agent needing to interact with its owner to obtain task and environment information relevant to scheduling.",
                "The CA module is responsible for deciding intelligently when and how to interact with the owner for improving the agents scheduling.",
                "As a result, the CA must estimate the expected benefit of any such interaction and the cost associated with it [19].",
                "In general, the net benefit of a potential interaction is PV − C, where V is the value of the information the user may have, P is the probability that the user has this information, and C is the cost associated with an interaction.",
                "The values of P, V , and C are time-varying, and the CA estimates their value at the intended time of initiating the interaction with its owner.",
                "This paper focuses on the twin problems of estimating the parameters P and C, both of which are user-centric in the sense of being determined by characteristics of the owner and the environment in which the owner is operating); it presumes a mechanism for determining V [18]. 2.1 Estimating Interruption Costs The cost of interrupting owners derives from the potential degradation in performance of tasks they are doing caused by the disruption [1; 9, inter alia].",
                "Research on interaction management has deployed sensor-based statistical models of human interruptibility to infer the degree of distraction likely to be caused by an interruption.",
                "This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying interruptions to times that are convenient.",
                "It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a users current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions.",
                "By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the users attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a users attention and intentions [9].",
                "Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5].",
                "Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions.",
                "First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider.",
                "Second, the interruptibility-estimation models are task-based.",
                "Lastly, it relies on continuous monitoring of a users activities.",
                "In fast-paced environments, there usually is no single task structure, and some of the activities themselves may have little internal structure.",
                "As a result, it is difficult to determine the actual attentional state of agent-owners [15].",
                "In such settings, owners must make complex decisions that typically involve a number of other members of their units, while remaining reactive to events that diverge from expectations [24].",

                "Prior work has tracked users focus of attention using a range of devices, including those able to monitor gestures [8] and track eyegaze to identify focus of visual attention [13, 20], thus enabling estimations of cognitive load and physical indicators of performance degradation.",
                "The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors.",
                "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
                "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
                "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",
                "Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.",
                "The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem.",
                "The CAs cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owners interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized.",
                "In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or maximize expected utility.",
                "The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function.",
                "We use a sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages.",
                "The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn.",
                "In particular, we consider the situation in which an agents owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x).",
                "The agent can activate sensing devices to get an estimation of the interruption cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of operating the sensing devices for a single time unit.",
                "The CA module sets a reservation value and as long as the sensor-based observation x is greater than this reservation value, the CA will wait and re-sample the user for a new estimation.",
                "The expected cost, V (xrv), using such a strategy with reservation value xrv is described by Equation 1, V (xrv) = c + R xrv y=0 yf(y) F(xrv) , (1) which decomposes into two parts.",
                "The first part, c divided by F(xrv), represents the expected sampling cost.",
                "The second, the integral divided by F(xrv), represents the expected cost of interruption, because the expected number of search cycles is (random) geometric and the probability of success is F(xrv).",
                "Taking the derivative of the left-hand-side of Equation 1 and equating it to zero, yields the characteristics of the optimal reservation value, namely x∗ rv must satisfy, V (x∗ rv) = x∗ rv. (2) Substituting (2) in Equation 1 yields Equation 3 (after integration by parts) from which the optimal reservation value, x∗ rv, and consequently (from Equation 2) V (x∗ rv) can be computed. c = Z x∗ rv y=0 F(y) (3) This method, which depends on extracting the optimal sequence of sensor-based user sampling, relies heavily on the structure of the distribution function, f(x).",
                "However, we need only a portion of the distribution function, namely from the origin to the reservation value. (See Equation 1 and Figure 1.)",
                "Thus, when we consider sharing data, it is not necessary to rely on complete similarity in the distribution function of different users.",
                "For some parameters, including the users interruptibility level, it is enough to rely on similarity in the relevant portion of the distribution function.",
                "The implementation described in Sections 4-5 relies on this fact.",
                "Figure 1: The distribution structure affecting the expected costs calculation 2.2 Estimating the Probability of Having Information One way an agent can estimate the probability a user will have information it needs (e.g., will know at a specific interruption time, with some level of reliability, the actual outcome of a task currently being executed) is to rely on prior interactions with this user, calculating the ratio between the number of times the user had the information and the total number of interactions.",
                "Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption.",
                "This indirect approach, which does not require interrupting the user, is especially useful in fast-paced domains.",
                "The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method: ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information.",
                "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",
                "Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.",
                "Given occasional updates about its owners level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs.",
                "Denoting the probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy.

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The more observations an agent can accumulate about the distribution of the frequency of an owners interaction with the environment at a given time, the better it can estimate the probability the owner has the information needed by the system. 3.",
                "THE SELECTIVE-SHARING MECHANISM This section presents the selective-sharing mechanism by which the CA learns the distribution function of a <br>probabilistic parameter</br> by taking advantage of data collected by other CAs in its environment.",
                "We first explain the need for increasing the number of observations used as the basis of estimation and then present a method for determining how much data to adopt from other agents.",
                "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
                "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
                "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",
                "For example, Figure 2 illustrates the reservation-value-based cost calculated according to observations received from an owner with a uniform interruption cost distribution U(0, 100) as a function of the number of accumulated observations used for generating the distribution histogram. (In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5).",
                "Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function.",
                "Eventually this method yields a very accurate estimation for the expected interruption cost.",
                "However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value.",
                "This error could seriously degrade the CAs decision making process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions.",
                "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",
                "One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents.",
                "Such an approach depends on identifying other owners with distribution functions for the characteristic of interest similar to the CAs owner.",
                "This dataaugmentation idea is simple: different owners may exhibit similar basic behaviors or patterns in similar fast-paced task scenarios.",
                "Since they are all coordinating on a common overall task and are operating in the same environment, it is reasonable to assume some level of similarity in the distribution function of their modeled parameters.",
                "People vary in their behavior, so, obviously, there may be different types of owners: some will emphasize communication with their teams, and some will spend more time on map-based planning; some will dislike being disturbed while trying to evaluate their teams progress, while others may be more open to interruptions.",
                "Consequently, an owners CA is likely to be able to find some CAs that are working with owners who are similar to its owner.",
                "When adopting data collected by other agents, the two main questions are which agents the CA should rely on and to what extent it should rely on each of them.",
                "The selective-sharing mechanism relies on a statistical measure of similarity that allows the CA of any specific user to identify the similarity between its owner and other owners dynamically.",
                "Based on this similarity level, the CA decides if and to what degree to import other CAs data in order to augment its direct observations, and thus to enable better modeling of its owners characteristics.",
                "It is notable that the cost of transferring observations between different CA modules of different agents is relatively small.",

                "The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames.",
                "Typically, agents must make decisions in real time, concurrent with task execution, and in the midst of great uncertainty.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we use the term fast-paced to refer to such environments.",
                "In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions.",
                "Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.",
                "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
                "That is, the <br>agent</br> is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",

                "Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate.",
                "Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given <br>agent</br> depends on the extent to which their users characteristics distributions are correlated with that of this agents user.",
                "There is no guarantee that the distribution for two different agents is highly, positively correlated, let alone that they are the same.",
                "Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a learning mechanism must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation.",
                "The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work.",
                "However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-<br>agent</br> settings in which agents are collecting data that overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets).",
                "In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each <br>agent</br> obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual parameters they need for their decision-making.",

                "Each <br>agent</br> operates on behalf of its owner (e.g., the team leader of a firstresponse team or a unit commander) whose schedule it manages.",
                "Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by owners or by units they oversee, and the agents responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners).",

                "However, the fast-paced nature of the domain constrains the amount of information they can share, precluding a centralized solution; scheduling problems must be solved distributively.",
                "The <br>agent</br>-owner relationship is a collaborative one, with the <br>agent</br> needing to interact with its owner to obtain task and environment information relevant to scheduling.",

                "The values of P, V , and C are time-varying, and the CA estimates their value at the intended time of initiating the interaction with its owner.",

                "Research on interaction management has deployed sensor-based statistical models of human interruptibility to infer the degree of distraction likely to be caused by an interruption.",
                "This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying interruptions to times that are convenient.",
                "It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a users current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions.",
                "By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the users attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a users attention and intentions [9].",
                "Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5].",
                "Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions.",
                "First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider.",
                "Second, the interruptibility-estimation models are task-based.",
                "Lastly, it relies on continuous monitoring of a users activities.",
                "In fast-paced environments, there usually is no single task structure, and some of the activities themselves may have little internal structure.",
                "As a result, it is difficult to determine the actual attentional state of <br>agent</br>-owners [15].",
                "In such settings, owners must make complex decisions that typically involve a number of other members of their units, while remaining reactive to events that diverge from expectations [24].",

                "The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors.",
                "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
                "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an <br>agent</br> cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
                "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",
                "Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an <br>agent</br> needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.",
                "The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem.",
                "The CAs cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owners interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized.",
                "In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or maximize expected utility.",
                "The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function.",
                "We use a sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages.",
                "The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn.",
                "In particular, we consider the situation in which an agents owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x).",
                "The <br>agent</br> can activate sensing devices to get an estimation of the interruption cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of operating the sensing devices for a single time unit.",
                "The CA module sets a reservation value and as long as the sensor-based observation x is greater than this reservation value, the CA will wait and re-sample the user for a new estimation.",
                "The expected cost, V (xrv), using such a strategy with reservation value xrv is described by Equation 1, V (xrv) = c + R xrv y=0 yf(y) F(xrv) , (1) which decomposes into two parts.",
                "The first part, c divided by F(xrv), represents the expected sampling cost.",
                "The second, the integral divided by F(xrv), represents the expected cost of interruption, because the expected number of search cycles is (random) geometric and the probability of success is F(xrv).",
                "Taking the derivative of the left-hand-side of Equation 1 and equating it to zero, yields the characteristics of the optimal reservation value, namely x∗ rv must satisfy, V (x∗ rv) = x∗ rv. (2) Substituting (2) in Equation 1 yields Equation 3 (after integration by parts) from which the optimal reservation value, x∗ rv, and consequently (from Equation 2) V (x∗ rv) can be computed. c = Z x∗ rv y=0 F(y) (3) This method, which depends on extracting the optimal sequence of sensor-based user sampling, relies heavily on the structure of the distribution function, f(x).",

                "Thus, when we consider sharing data, it is not necessary to rely on complete similarity in the distribution function of different users.",
                "For some parameters, including the users interruptibility level, it is enough to rely on similarity in the relevant portion of the distribution function.",

                "Alternatively, the <br>agent</br> can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption.",
                "This indirect approach, which does not require interrupting the user, is especially useful in fast-paced domains.",
                "The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method: ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information.",
                "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",
                "Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.",
                "Given occasional updates about its owners level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs.",
                "Denoting the probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy.

                "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
                "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
                "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",
                "For example, Figure 2 illustrates the reservation-value-based cost calculated according to observations received from an owner with a uniform interruption cost distribution U(0, 100) as a function of the number of accumulated observations used for generating the distribution histogram. (In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5).",
                "Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function.",
                "Eventually this method yields a very accurate estimation for the expected interruption cost.",
                "However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value.",
                "This error could seriously degrade the CAs decision making process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions.",
                "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the <br>agent</br> is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",
                "One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents.",
                "Such an approach depends on identifying other owners with distribution functions for the characteristic of interest similar to the CAs owner.",
                "This dataaugmentation idea is simple: different owners may exhibit similar basic behaviors or patterns in similar fast-paced task scenarios.",
                "Since they are all coordinating on a common overall task and are operating in the same environment, it is reasonable to assume some level of similarity in the distribution function of their modeled parameters.",
                "People vary in their behavior, so, obviously, there may be different types of owners: some will emphasize communication with their teams, and some will spend more time on map-based planning; some will dislike being disturbed while trying to evaluate their teams progress, while others may be more open to interruptions.",
                "Consequently, an owners CA is likely to be able to find some CAs that are working with owners who are similar to its owner.",
                "When adopting data collected by other agents, the two main questions are which agents the CA should rely on and to what extent it should rely on each of them.",
                "The selective-sharing mechanism relies on a statistical measure of similarity that allows the CA of any specific user to identify the similarity between its owner and other owners dynamically.",
                "Based on this similarity level, the CA decides if and to what degree to import other CAs data in order to augment its direct observations, and thus to enable better modeling of its owners characteristics.",
                "It is notable that the cost of transferring observations between different CA modules of different agents is relatively small.",
                "This information can be transferred as part of regular negotiation communication between agents.",
                "The volume of such communication is negligible: it involves just the transmission of new observations values.",
                "In our learning mechanism, the CA constantly updates its estimation of the level of similarity between its owner and the owners represented by other CAs in the environment.",
                "Each new observation obtained either by that CA or any of the other CAs updates this estimation.",
                "The similarity level is determined using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Subsection 3.1).",

                "The number of additional observations to be taken from each other <br>agent</br> is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the similarity between its owner and other owners.",
                "In most cases, the number of observations the CA will want to take from another <br>agent</br> is smaller than the overall number of observations the other <br>agent</br> has; thus, it randomly samples (without repetitions) the required number of observations from this other agents database.",
                "The additional observations the CA takes from other agents are used only to model its owners characteristics.",
                "Future similarity level determination is not affected by this information augmentation procedure. 3.1 The Wilcoxon Test We use a nonparametric method (i.e., one that makes no assumptions about the parametric form of the distributions each set is drawn from), because user characteristics in fast-paced domains do not have the structure needed for parametric approaches.",
                "Two additional advantages of a non-parametric approach are their usefulness for dealing with unexpected, outlying observations (possibly problematic for a parametric approach), and the fact that non-parametric approaches are computationally very simple and thus ideal for settings in which computational resources are scarce.",

                "The Wilcoxon test does not require that the data originates from a normally distributed population or that the distribution is characterized by a finite set of parameters. 3.2 Determining Required Information Correctly identifying the right number of additional observations to gather is a key determinant of success of the selective-sharing mechanism.",
                "Obviously, if the CA can identify another owner who has identical characteristics to the owner it represents, then it should use all of the observations collected by that owners <br>agent</br>.",
                "However, cases of identical matches are likely to be very uncommon.",
                "Furthermore, even to establish that another user is identical to its own, the CA would need substantial sample sizes to have a relatively high level of confidence.",
                "Thus, usually the CA needs to decide how much to rely on another agents data while estimating various levels of similarity with a changing level of confidence.",
                "At the beginning of its process, the selective-sharing mechanism has almost no data to rely on, and thus no similarity measure can be used.",
                "In this case, the CA module relies heavily on other agents, in the expectation that all owners have some basic level of similarity in their distribution (see Section 2).",
                "As the number of its direct observations increases, the CA module refines the number of additional observations required.",
                "Again, there are two conflicting effects.",

                "Therefore, when CAi decides how many additional observations, Oi j should be adopted from CAjs database, it calculates Oi j as follows: Oi j = N ∗ (1 − αi,j) √ N + 2 + ln(N) N (5) where N is the number of observations CAi already has (which is similar in magnitude to the number of observations CAj has) and αi,j is the confidence of rejecting the Wilcoxon null hypothesis.",
                "The function in Equation 5 ensures that the number of additional observations to be taken from another CA module increases as the confidence in the similarity with the source for these additional observations increases.",

                "To avoid undesirable bias in relatively heterogeneous environments while effectively using relevant data to improve its estimations, the mechanism weighs the contributions of other agents observations based on a real-time estimation of the level of similarity between each of these agents and itself.",

                "INTRODUCTION For many real-world scenarios, autonomous agents need to operate in dynamic, uncertain environments in which they have only incomplete information about the results of their actions and characteristics of other agents or people with whom they need to cooperate or collaborate.",
                "In such environments, agents can benefit from sharing information they gather, pooling their individual experiences to improve their estimations of unknown parameters required for reasoning about actions under uncertainty.",
                "This paper addresses the problem of learning the distribution of the values of a probabilistic parameter that represents a characteristic of a person who is interacting with a computer agent.",
                "The characteristic to be learned is (or is clearly related to) an important factor in the agents decision making.1 The basic setting we consider is one in which an agent accumulates observations about a specific user characteristic and uses them to produce a timely estimate of some measure that depends on that characteristics distribution.",
                "The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames.",
                "Typically, agents must make decisions in real time, concurrent with task execution, and in the midst of great uncertainty.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we use the term fast-paced to refer to such environments.",
                "In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions.",
                "Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.",
                "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
                "That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",
                "In such environments, an agents individually acquired data (its own observations) are too sparse for it to obtain good estimations in the requisite time frame.",
                "Given the no-structure-constraint of the environment, approaches that depend on structured distributions may result in a significantly high estimation bias.",
                "We consider this problem in the context of a multi-agent distributed system in which computer agents support people who are carrying out complex tasks in a dynamic environment.",
                "The fact that agents are part of a multi-agent setting, in which other agents may 1 Learning the distribution rather than just determining some value in the distribution is important whenever the overall shape of the distribution and not just such individual features as mean are important. also be gathering data to estimate a similar characteristic of their users, offers the possibility for an agent to augment its own observations with those of other agents, thus improving the accuracy of its learning process.",
                "Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate.",
                "Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given agent depends on the extent to which their users characteristics distributions are correlated with that of this agents user.",
                "There is no guarantee that the distribution for two different agents is highly, positively correlated, let alone that they are the same.",
                "Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a learning mechanism must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation.",
                "The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work.",
                "However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-agent settings in which agents are collecting data that overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets).",
                "In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual parameters they need for their decision-making.",
                "In this paper, we present a mechanism that was used for learning key user characteristics in fast-paced environments.",
                "The mechanism provides relatively accurate estimations within short time frames by augmenting an individual agents direct observations with observations obtained by other agents with which it is coordinating.",
                "In particular, we focus on the related problems of estimating the cost of interrupting a person and estimating the probability that that person will have the information required by the system.",
                "Our adaptive approach, which we will refer to throughout the paper as selective-sharing, allows our CA to improve the accuracy of its distribution-based estimations in comparison to relying only on the interactions with a specific user (subsequently, self-learning) or pooling all data unconditionally (average all), in particular when the number of available observations is relatively small.",
                "The mechanism was successfully tested using a system that simulates a Coordinators environment.",

                "In this domain, autonomous agents, called Coordinators, are intended to help maximize an overall team objective by handling changes in the task schedule as conditions of operation change.",
                "Each agent operates on behalf of its owner (e.g., the team leader of a firstresponse team or a unit commander) whose schedule it manages.",
                "Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by owners or by units they oversee, and the agents responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners).",
                "In this domain, scheduling information and constraints are distributed.",
                "Each agent receives a different view of the tasks and structures that constitute the full multi-agent problem-typically only a partial, local one.",
                "Schedule revisions that affect more than one agent must be coordinated, so agents thus must share certain kinds of information. (In a team context they may be designed to share other types as well.)",
                "However, the fast-paced nature of the domain constrains the amount of information they can share, precluding a centralized solution; scheduling problems must be solved distributively.",
                "The agent-owner relationship is a collaborative one, with the agent needing to interact with its owner to obtain task and environment information relevant to scheduling.",
                "The CA module is responsible for deciding intelligently when and how to interact with the owner for improving the agents scheduling.",
                "As a result, the CA must estimate the expected benefit of any such interaction and the cost associated with it [19].",
                "In general, the net benefit of a potential interaction is PV − C, where V is the value of the information the user may have, P is the probability that the user has this information, and C is the cost associated with an interaction.",
                "The values of P, V , and C are time-varying, and the CA estimates their value at the intended time of initiating the interaction with its owner.",
                "This paper focuses on the twin problems of estimating the parameters P and C, both of which are user-centric in the sense of being determined by characteristics of the owner and the environment in which the owner is operating); it presumes a mechanism for determining V [18]. 2.1 Estimating Interruption Costs The cost of interrupting owners derives from the potential degradation in performance of tasks they are doing caused by the disruption [1; 9, inter alia].",
                "Research on interaction management has deployed sensor-based statistical models of human interruptibility to infer the degree of distraction likely to be caused by an interruption.",
                "This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying interruptions to times that are convenient.",
                "It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a users current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions.",
                "By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the users attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a users attention and intentions [9].",
                "Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5].",
                "Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions.",
                "First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider.",
                "Second, the interruptibility-estimation models are task-based.",
                "Lastly, it relies on continuous monitoring of a users activities.",
                "In fast-paced environments, there usually is no single task structure, and some of the activities themselves may have little internal structure.",
                "As a result, it is difficult to determine the actual attentional state of agent-owners [15].",
                "In such settings, owners must make complex decisions that typically involve a number of other members of their units, while remaining reactive to events that diverge from expectations [24].",

                "Prior work has tracked users focus of attention using a range of devices, including those able to monitor gestures [8] and track eyegaze to identify focus of visual attention [13, 20], thus enabling estimations of cognitive load and physical indicators of performance degradation.",
                "The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors.",
                "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
                "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
                "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",
                "Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.",
                "The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem.",
                "The CAs cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owners interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized.",
                "In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or maximize expected utility.",
                "The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function.",
                "We use a sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages.",
                "The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn.",
                "In particular, we consider the situation in which an agents owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x).",
                "The agent can activate sensing devices to get an estimation of the interruption cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of operating the sensing devices for a single time unit.",
                "The CA module sets a reservation value and as long as the sensor-based observation x is greater than this reservation value, the CA will wait and re-sample the user for a new estimation.",
                "The expected cost, V (xrv), using such a strategy with reservation value xrv is described by Equation 1, V (xrv) = c + R xrv y=0 yf(y) F(xrv) , (1) which decomposes into two parts.",
                "The first part, c divided by F(xrv), represents the expected sampling cost.",
                "The second, the integral divided by F(xrv), represents the expected cost of interruption, because the expected number of search cycles is (random) geometric and the probability of success is F(xrv).",
                "Taking the derivative of the left-hand-side of Equation 1 and equating it to zero, yields the characteristics of the optimal reservation value, namely x∗ rv must satisfy, V (x∗ rv) = x∗ rv. (2) Substituting (2) in Equation 1 yields Equation 3 (after integration by parts) from which the optimal reservation value, x∗ rv, and consequently (from Equation 2) V (x∗ rv) can be computed. c = Z x∗ rv y=0 F(y) (3) This method, which depends on extracting the optimal sequence of sensor-based user sampling, relies heavily on the structure of the distribution function, f(x).",
                "However, we need only a portion of the distribution function, namely from the origin to the reservation value. (See Equation 1 and Figure 1.)",
                "Thus, when we consider sharing data, it is not necessary to rely on complete similarity in the distribution function of different users.",
                "For some parameters, including the users interruptibility level, it is enough to rely on similarity in the relevant portion of the distribution function.",
                "The implementation described in Sections 4-5 relies on this fact.",
                "Figure 1: The distribution structure affecting the expected costs calculation 2.2 Estimating the Probability of Having Information One way an agent can estimate the probability a user will have information it needs (e.g., will know at a specific interruption time, with some level of reliability, the actual outcome of a task currently being executed) is to rely on prior interactions with this user, calculating the ratio between the number of times the user had the information and the total number of interactions.",
                "Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption.",
                "This indirect approach, which does not require interrupting the user, is especially useful in fast-paced domains.",
                "The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method: ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information.",
                "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",
                "Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.",
                "Given occasional updates about its owners level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs.",
                "Denoting the probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy.

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The more observations an agent can accumulate about the distribution of the frequency of an owners interaction with the environment at a given time, the better it can estimate the probability the owner has the information needed by the system. 3.",
                "THE SELECTIVE-SHARING MECHANISM This section presents the selective-sharing mechanism by which the CA learns the distribution function of a probabilistic parameter by taking advantage of data collected by other CAs in its environment.",
                "We first explain the need for increasing the number of observations used as the basis of estimation and then present a method for determining how much data to adopt from other agents.",
                "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
                "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
                "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",

                "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",

                "INTRODUCTION For many real-world scenarios, autonomous agents need to operate in dynamic, uncertain environments in which they have only incomplete information about the results of their actions and characteristics of other agents or people with whom they need to cooperate or collaborate.",
                "In such environments, agents can benefit from sharing information they gather, pooling their individual experiences to improve their estimations of unknown parameters required for reasoning about actions under uncertainty.",

                "The characteristic to be learned is (or is clearly related to) an important factor in the agents <br>decision making</br>1 The basic setting we consider is one in which an agent accumulates observations about a specific user characteristic and uses them to produce a timely estimate of some measure that depends on that characteristics distribution.",
                "The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames.",
                "Typically, agents must make decisions in real time, concurrent with task execution, and in the midst of great uncertainty.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we use the term fast-paced to refer to such environments.",
                "In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions.",
                "Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.",
                "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
                "That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",
                "In such environments, an agents individually acquired data (its own observations) are too sparse for it to obtain good estimations in the requisite time frame.",
                "Given the no-structure-constraint of the environment, approaches that depend on structured distributions may result in a significantly high estimation bias.",
                "We consider this problem in the context of a multi-agent distributed system in which computer agents support people who are carrying out complex tasks in a dynamic environment.",
                "The fact that agents are part of a multi-agent setting, in which other agents may 1 Learning the distribution rather than just determining some value in the distribution is important whenever the overall shape of the distribution and not just such individual features as mean are important. also be gathering data to estimate a similar characteristic of their users, offers the possibility for an agent to augment its own observations with those of other agents, thus improving the accuracy of its learning process.",
                "Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate.",
                "Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given agent depends on the extent to which their users characteristics distributions are correlated with that of this agents user.",
                "There is no guarantee that the distribution for two different agents is highly, positively correlated, let alone that they are the same.",
                "Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a learning mechanism must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation.",
                "The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work.",
                "However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-agent settings in which agents are collecting data that overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets).",
                "In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual parameters they need for their decision-making.",
                "In this paper, we present a mechanism that was used for learning key user characteristics in fast-paced environments.",
                "The mechanism provides relatively accurate estimations within short time frames by augmenting an individual agents direct observations with observations obtained by other agents with which it is coordinating.",
                "In particular, we focus on the related problems of estimating the cost of interrupting a person and estimating the probability that that person will have the information required by the system.",
                "Our adaptive approach, which we will refer to throughout the paper as selective-sharing, allows our CA to improve the accuracy of its distribution-based estimations in comparison to relying only on the interactions with a specific user (subsequently, self-learning) or pooling all data unconditionally (average all), in particular when the number of available observations is relatively small.",

                "Each agent operates on behalf of its owner (e.g., the team leader of a firstresponse team or a unit commander) whose schedule it manages.",
                "Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by owners or by units they oversee, and the agents responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners).",
                "In this domain, scheduling information and constraints are distributed.",
                "Each agent receives a different view of the tasks and structures that constitute the full multi-agent problem-typically only a partial, local one.",
                "Schedule revisions that affect more than one agent must be coordinated, so agents thus must share certain kinds of information. (In a team context they may be designed to share other types as well.)",
                "However, the fast-paced nature of the domain constrains the amount of information they can share, precluding a centralized solution; scheduling problems must be solved distributively.",
                "The agent-owner relationship is a collaborative one, with the agent needing to interact with its owner to obtain task and environment information relevant to scheduling.",
                "The CA module is responsible for deciding intelligently when and how to interact with the owner for improving the agents scheduling.",
                "As a result, the CA must estimate the expected benefit of any such interaction and the cost associated with it [19].",
                "In general, the net benefit of a potential interaction is PV − C, where V is the value of the information the user may have, P is the probability that the user has this information, and C is the cost associated with an interaction.",
                "The values of P, V , and C are time-varying, and the CA estimates their value at the intended time of initiating the interaction with its owner.",
                "This paper focuses on the twin problems of estimating the parameters P and C, both of which are user-centric in the sense of being determined by characteristics of the owner and the environment in which the owner is operating); it presumes a mechanism for determining V [18]. 2.1 Estimating Interruption Costs The cost of interrupting owners derives from the potential degradation in performance of tasks they are doing caused by the disruption [1; 9, inter alia].",
                "Research on interaction management has deployed sensor-based statistical models of human interruptibility to infer the degree of distraction likely to be caused by an interruption.",
                "This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying interruptions to times that are convenient.",
                "It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a users current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions.",
                "By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the users attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a users attention and intentions [9].",
                "Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5].",
                "Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions.",
                "First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider.",
                "Second, the interruptibility-estimation models are task-based.",
                "Lastly, it relies on continuous monitoring of a users activities.",
                "In fast-paced environments, there usually is no single task structure, and some of the activities themselves may have little internal structure.",
                "As a result, it is difficult to determine the actual attentional state of agent-owners [15].",
                "In such settings, owners must make complex decisions that typically involve a number of other members of their units, while remaining reactive to events that diverge from expectations [24].",

                "The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors.",
                "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
                "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
                "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",
                "Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.",
                "The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem.",
                "The CAs cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owners interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized.",
                "In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or maximize expected utility.",
                "The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function.",
                "We use a sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages.",

                "Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption.",

                "The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method: ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information.",
                "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",
                "Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.",
                "Given occasional updates about its owners level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs.",
                "Denoting the probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy.

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The more observations an agent can accumulate about the distribution of the frequency of an owners interaction with the environment at a given time, the better it can estimate the probability the owner has the information needed by the system. 3.",

                "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
                "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
                "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",

(In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5).",
                "Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function.",

                "However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value.",
                "This error could seriously degrade the CAs <br>decision making</br> process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions.",
                "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",
                "One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents.",
                "Such an approach depends on identifying other owners with distribution functions for the characteristic of interest similar to the CAs owner.",
                "This dataaugmentation idea is simple: different owners may exhibit similar basic behaviors or patterns in similar fast-paced task scenarios.",
                "Since they are all coordinating on a common overall task and are operating in the same environment, it is reasonable to assume some level of similarity in the distribution function of their modeled parameters.",
                "People vary in their behavior, so, obviously, there may be different types of owners: some will emphasize communication with their teams, and some will spend more time on map-based planning; some will dislike being disturbed while trying to evaluate their teams progress, while others may be more open to interruptions.",

                "The number of additional observations to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the similarity between its owner and other owners.",
                "In most cases, the number of observations the CA will want to take from another agent is smaller than the overall number of observations the other agent has; thus, it randomly samples (without repetitions) the required number of observations from this other agents database.",

                "Two additional advantages of a non-parametric approach are their usefulness for dealing with unexpected, outlying observations (possibly problematic for a parametric approach), and the fact that non-parametric approaches are computationally very simple and thus ideal for settings in which computational resources are scarce.",

                "The characteristic to be learned is (or is clearly related to) an important factor in the agents decision making.1 The basic setting we consider is one in which an agent accumulates observations about a specific user characteristic and uses them to produce a timely estimate of some measure that depends on that characteristics distribution.",
                "The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames.",

                "In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions.",
                "Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.",
                "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
                "That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",

                "The fact that agents are part of a multi-agent setting, in which other agents may 1 Learning the distribution rather than just determining some value in the distribution is important whenever the overall shape of the distribution and not just such individual features as mean are important. also be gathering data to estimate a similar characteristic of their users, offers the possibility for an agent to augment its own observations with those of other agents, thus improving the accuracy of its learning process.",
                "Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate.",
                "Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given agent depends on the extent to which their users characteristics distributions are correlated with that of this agents user.",
                "There is no guarantee that the distribution for two different agents is highly, positively correlated, let alone that they are the same.",
                "Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a learning mechanism must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation.",
                "The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work.",
                "However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-agent settings in which agents are collecting data that overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets).",
                "In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual parameters they need for their decision-making.",
                "In this paper, we present a mechanism that was used for learning key user characteristics in fast-paced environments.",

                "Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by owners or by units they oversee, and the agents responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners).",
                "In this domain, scheduling information and constraints are distributed.",
                "Each agent receives a different view of the tasks and structures that constitute the full multi-agent problem-typically only a partial, local one.",

                "The agent-owner relationship is a collaborative one, with the agent needing to interact with its owner to obtain task and environment information relevant to scheduling.",
                "The CA module is responsible for deciding intelligently when and how to interact with the owner for improving the agents scheduling.",
                "As a result, the CA must estimate the expected benefit of any such interaction and the cost associated with it [19].",
                "In general, the net benefit of a potential interaction is PV − C, where V is the value of the information the user may have, P is the probability that the user has this information, and C is the cost associated with an interaction.",

                "This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying interruptions to times that are convenient.",
                "It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a users current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions.",
                "By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the users attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a users attention and intentions [9].",
                "Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5].",
                "Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions.",
                "First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider.",

                "The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors.",
                "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
                "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
                "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",
                "Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.",
                "The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem.",
                "The CAs cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owners interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized.",
                "In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or maximize expected utility.",
                "The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function.",
                "We use a sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages.",
                "The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn.",
                "In particular, we consider the situation in which an agents owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x).",
                "The agent can activate sensing devices to get an estimation of the interruption cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of operating the sensing devices for a single time unit.",
                "The CA module sets a reservation value and as long as the sensor-based observation x is greater than this reservation value, the CA will wait and re-sample the user for a new estimation.",
                "The expected cost, V (xrv), using such a strategy with reservation value xrv is described by Equation 1, V (xrv) = c + R xrv y=0 yf(y) F(xrv) , (1) which decomposes into two parts.",
                "The first part, c divided by F(xrv), represents the expected sampling cost.",
                "The second, the integral divided by F(xrv), represents the expected cost of interruption, because the expected number of search cycles is (random) geometric and the probability of success is F(xrv).",
                "Taking the derivative of the left-hand-side of Equation 1 and equating it to zero, yields the characteristics of the optimal reservation value, namely x∗ rv must satisfy, V (x∗ rv) = x∗ rv. (2) Substituting (2) in Equation 1 yields Equation 3 (after integration by parts) from which the optimal reservation value, x∗ rv, and consequently (from Equation 2) V (x∗ rv) can be computed. c = Z x∗ rv y=0 F(y) (3) This method, which depends on extracting the optimal sequence of sensor-based user sampling, relies heavily on the structure of the distribution function, f(x).",
                "However, we need only a portion of the distribution function, namely from the origin to the reservation value. (See Equation 1 and Figure 1.)",

                "For some parameters, including the users interruptibility level, it is enough to rely on similarity in the relevant portion of the distribution function.",

                "Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption.",
                "This indirect approach, which does not require interrupting the user, is especially useful in fast-paced domains.",
                "The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method: ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information.",
                "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",
                "Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.",
                "Given occasional updates about its owners level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs.",
                "Denoting the probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy.

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The more observations an agent can accumulate about the distribution of the frequency of an owners interaction with the environment at a given time, the better it can estimate the probability the owner has the information needed by the system. 3.",

                "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
                "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
                "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",
                "For example, Figure 2 illustrates the reservation-value-based cost calculated according to observations received from an owner with a uniform interruption cost distribution U(0, 100) as a function of the number of accumulated observations used for generating the distribution histogram. (In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5).",
                "Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function.",
                "Eventually this method yields a very accurate estimation for the expected interruption cost.",
                "However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value.",
                "This error could seriously degrade the CAs decision making process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions.",
                "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",
                "One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents.",
                "Such an approach depends on identifying other owners with distribution functions for the characteristic of interest similar to the CAs owner.",
                "This dataaugmentation idea is simple: different owners may exhibit similar basic behaviors or patterns in similar fast-paced task scenarios.",
                "Since they are all coordinating on a common overall task and are operating in the same environment, it is reasonable to assume some level of similarity in the distribution function of their modeled parameters.",
                "People vary in their behavior, so, obviously, there may be different types of owners: some will emphasize communication with their teams, and some will spend more time on map-based planning; some will dislike being disturbed while trying to evaluate their teams progress, while others may be more open to interruptions.",
                "Consequently, an owners CA is likely to be able to find some CAs that are working with owners who are similar to its owner.",
                "When adopting data collected by other agents, the two main questions are which agents the CA should rely on and to what extent it should rely on each of them.",
                "The selective-sharing mechanism relies on a statistical measure of similarity that allows the CA of any specific user to identify the similarity between its owner and other owners dynamically.",
                "Based on this similarity level, the CA decides if and to what degree to import other CAs data in order to augment its direct observations, and thus to enable better modeling of its owners characteristics.",
                "It is notable that the cost of transferring observations between different CA modules of different agents is relatively small.",
                "This information can be transferred as part of regular negotiation communication between agents.",
                "The volume of such communication is negligible: it involves just the transmission of new observations values.",
                "In our learning mechanism, the CA constantly updates its estimation of the level of similarity between its owner and the owners represented by other CAs in the environment.",
                "Each new observation obtained either by that CA or any of the other CAs updates this estimation.",

                "Whenever it is necessary to produce a parameter estimate, the CA decides on the number of additional observations it intends to rely on for extracting its estimation.",
                "The number of additional observations to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the similarity between its owner and other owners.",
                "In most cases, the number of observations the CA will want to take from another agent is smaller than the overall number of observations the other agent has; thus, it randomly samples (without repetitions) the required number of observations from this other agents database.",
                "The additional observations the CA takes from other agents are used only to model its owners characteristics.",

                "Two additional advantages of a non-parametric approach are their usefulness for dealing with unexpected, outlying observations (possibly problematic for a parametric approach), and the fact that non-parametric approaches are computationally very simple and thus ideal for settings in which computational resources are scarce.",

                "Obviously, if the CA can identify another owner who has identical characteristics to the owner it represents, then it should use all of the observations collected by that owners agent.",
                "However, cases of identical matches are likely to be very uncommon.",
                "Furthermore, even to establish that another user is identical to its own, the CA would need substantial sample sizes to have a relatively high level of confidence.",

                "In this case, the CA module relies heavily on other agents, in the expectation that all owners have some basic level of similarity in their distribution (see Section 2).",
                "As the number of its direct observations increases, the CA module refines the number of additional observations required.",
                "Again, there are two conflicting effects.",

                "On the other hand, assuming there is some difference among owners (even if not noticed yet), as the number of its direct observations increases, the owners own data should gain weight in its analysis.",
                "Therefore, when CAi decides how many additional observations, Oi j should be adopted from CAjs database, it calculates Oi j as follows: Oi j = N ∗ (1 − αi,j) √ N + 2 + ln(N) N (5) where N is the number of observations CAi already has (which is similar in magnitude to the number of observations CAj has) and αi,j is the confidence of rejecting the Wilcoxon null hypothesis.",

                "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
                "That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",

                "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
                "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
                "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",
                "Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.",

                "The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn.",
                "In particular, we consider the situation in which an agents owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x).",
                "The agent can activate sensing devices to get an estimation of the interruption cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of operating the sensing devices for a single time unit.",
                "The CA module sets a reservation value and as long as the sensor-based observation x is greater than this reservation value, the CA will wait and re-sample the user for a new estimation.",
                "The expected cost, V (xrv), using such a strategy with reservation value xrv is described by Equation 1, V (xrv) = c + R xrv y=0 yf(y) F(xrv) , (1) which decomposes into two parts.",

                "The second, the integral divided by F(xrv), represents the expected cost of interruption, because the expected number of search cycles is (random) geometric and the probability of success is F(xrv).",
                "Taking the derivative of the left-hand-side of Equation 1 and equating it to zero, yields the characteristics of the optimal reservation value, namely x∗ rv must satisfy, V (x∗ rv) = x∗ rv. (2) Substituting (2) in Equation 1 yields Equation 3 (after integration by parts) from which the optimal reservation value, x∗ rv, and consequently (from Equation 2) V (x∗ rv) can be computed. c = Z x∗ rv y=0 F(y) (3) This method, which depends on extracting the optimal sequence of sensor-based user sampling, relies heavily on the structure of the distribution function, f(x).",

                "Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption.",

                "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",
                "Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.",

                "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
                "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
                "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",

(In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5).",
                "Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function.",

                "However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value.",
                "This error could seriously degrade the CAs decision making process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions.",
                "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",
                "One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents.",

                "This dataaugmentation idea is simple: different owners may exhibit similar basic behaviors or patterns in similar fast-paced task scenarios.",
                "Since they are all coordinating on a common overall task and are operating in the same environment, it is reasonable to assume some level of similarity in the distribution function of their modeled parameters.",
                "People vary in their behavior, so, obviously, there may be different types of owners: some will emphasize communication with their teams, and some will spend more time on map-based planning; some will dislike being disturbed while trying to evaluate their teams progress, while others may be more open to interruptions.",

                "Based on this similarity level, the CA decides if and to what degree to import other CAs data in order to augment its direct observations, and thus to enable better modeling of its owners characteristics.",
                "It is notable that the cost of transferring observations between different CA modules of different agents is relatively small.",
                "This information can be transferred as part of regular negotiation communication between agents.",
                "The volume of such communication is negligible: it involves just the transmission of new observations values.",
                "In our learning mechanism, the CA constantly updates its estimation of the level of similarity between its owner and the owners represented by other CAs in the environment.",

                "The number of additional observations to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the similarity between its owner and other owners.",
                "In most cases, the number of observations the CA will want to take from another agent is smaller than the overall number of observations the other agent has; thus, it randomly samples (without repetitions) the required number of observations from this other agents database.",

                "Two additional advantages of a non-parametric approach are their usefulness for dealing with unexpected, outlying observations (possibly problematic for a parametric approach), and the fact that non-parametric approaches are computationally very simple and thus ideal for settings in which computational resources are scarce.",

                "The selective-sharing mechanism performs better or worse, depending on the type, because the Wilcoxon test cannot guarantee an exact identification of similarity; different combinations of distribution function can result in an inability to exactly identify the similar users for some of the specific types.",

                "Last, despite the difference in their overall distribution function, agents of type IV and V exhibit similar performance because the relevant portion of their distribution functions (i.e., the effective parts that affect the RV calculation as explained in Figure 1) is identical.",
                "Thus, the selective-sharing mechanism enables the agent of type V, despite its unique distribution function, to adopt relevant information collected by agents of types IV which improves its estimation of the expected interruption cost. 5.2 General Evaluation To evaluate selective-sharing, we ran a series of simulations in which the environment was randomly generated.",

                "The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames.",
                "Typically, agents must make decisions in real time, concurrent with task execution, and in the midst of great uncertainty.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we use the term fast-paced to refer to such environments.",
                "In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions.",
                "Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.",
                "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
                "That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",

                "Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a <br>learning mechanism</br> must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation.",
                "The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work.",

                "Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by owners or by units they oversee, and the agents responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners).",
                "In this domain, scheduling information and constraints are distributed.",
                "Each agent receives a different view of the tasks and structures that constitute the full multi-agent problem-typically only a partial, local one.",
                "Schedule revisions that affect more than one agent must be coordinated, so agents thus must share certain kinds of information. (In a team context they may be designed to share other types as well.)",

                "Research on interaction management has deployed sensor-based statistical models of human interruptibility to infer the degree of distraction likely to be caused by an interruption.",
                "This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying interruptions to times that are convenient.",
                "It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a users current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions.",
                "By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the users attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a users attention and intentions [9].",
                "Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5].",
                "Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions.",
                "First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider.",
                "Second, the interruptibility-estimation models are task-based.",
                "Lastly, it relies on continuous monitoring of a users activities.",
                "In fast-paced environments, there usually is no single task structure, and some of the activities themselves may have little internal structure.",
                "As a result, it is difficult to determine the actual attentional state of agent-owners [15].",
                "In such settings, owners must make complex decisions that typically involve a number of other members of their units, while remaining reactive to events that diverge from expectations [24].",

                "The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors.",
                "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
                "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
                "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",
                "Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.",
                "The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem.",
                "The CAs cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owners interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized.",
                "In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or maximize expected utility.",
                "The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function.",
                "We use a sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages.",
                "The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn.",
                "In particular, we consider the situation in which an agents owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x).",
                "The agent can activate sensing devices to get an estimation of the interruption cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of operating the sensing devices for a single time unit.",
                "The CA module sets a reservation value and as long as the sensor-based observation x is greater than this reservation value, the CA will wait and re-sample the user for a new estimation.",
                "The expected cost, V (xrv), using such a strategy with reservation value xrv is described by Equation 1, V (xrv) = c + R xrv y=0 yf(y) F(xrv) , (1) which decomposes into two parts.",
                "The first part, c divided by F(xrv), represents the expected sampling cost.",
                "The second, the integral divided by F(xrv), represents the expected cost of interruption, because the expected number of search cycles is (random) geometric and the probability of success is F(xrv).",
                "Taking the derivative of the left-hand-side of Equation 1 and equating it to zero, yields the characteristics of the optimal reservation value, namely x∗ rv must satisfy, V (x∗ rv) = x∗ rv. (2) Substituting (2) in Equation 1 yields Equation 3 (after integration by parts) from which the optimal reservation value, x∗ rv, and consequently (from Equation 2) V (x∗ rv) can be computed. c = Z x∗ rv y=0 F(y) (3) This method, which depends on extracting the optimal sequence of sensor-based user sampling, relies heavily on the structure of the distribution function, f(x).",
                "However, we need only a portion of the distribution function, namely from the origin to the reservation value. (See Equation 1 and Figure 1.)",
                "Thus, when we consider sharing data, it is not necessary to rely on complete similarity in the distribution function of different users.",
                "For some parameters, including the users interruptibility level, it is enough to rely on similarity in the relevant portion of the distribution function.",
                "The implementation described in Sections 4-5 relies on this fact.",
                "Figure 1: The distribution structure affecting the expected costs calculation 2.2 Estimating the Probability of Having Information One way an agent can estimate the probability a user will have information it needs (e.g., will know at a specific interruption time, with some level of reliability, the actual outcome of a task currently being executed) is to rely on prior interactions with this user, calculating the ratio between the number of times the user had the information and the total number of interactions.",
                "Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption.",
                "This indirect approach, which does not require interrupting the user, is especially useful in fast-paced domains.",
                "The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method: ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information.",
                "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",
                "Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.",
                "Given occasional updates about its owners level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs.",
                "Denoting the probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy.

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The more observations an agent can accumulate about the distribution of the frequency of an owners interaction with the environment at a given time, the better it can estimate the probability the owner has the information needed by the system. 3.",
                "THE SELECTIVE-SHARING MECHANISM This section presents the selective-sharing mechanism by which the CA learns the distribution function of a probabilistic parameter by taking advantage of data collected by other CAs in its environment.",
                "We first explain the need for increasing the number of observations used as the basis of estimation and then present a method for determining how much data to adopt from other agents.",
                "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
                "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
                "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",
                "For example, Figure 2 illustrates the reservation-value-based cost calculated according to observations received from an owner with a uniform interruption cost distribution U(0, 100) as a function of the number of accumulated observations used for generating the distribution histogram. (In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5).",
                "Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function.",
                "Eventually this method yields a very accurate estimation for the expected interruption cost.",
                "However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value.",
                "This error could seriously degrade the CAs decision making process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions.",
                "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",
                "One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents.",
                "Such an approach depends on identifying other owners with distribution functions for the characteristic of interest similar to the CAs owner.",

                "The characteristic to be learned is (or is clearly related to) an important factor in the agents decision making.1 The basic setting we consider is one in which an agent accumulates observations about a specific user characteristic and uses them to produce a timely estimate of some measure that depends on that characteristics distribution.",
                "The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames.",
                "Typically, agents must make decisions in real time, concurrent with task execution, and in the midst of great uncertainty.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we use the term fast-paced to refer to such environments.",
                "In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions.",
                "Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.",
                "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
                "That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",

                "Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate.",
                "Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given agent depends on the extent to which their users characteristics distributions are correlated with that of this agents user.",

                "Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a learning mechanism must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation.",
                "The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work.",
                "However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-agent settings in which agents are collecting data that overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets).",
                "In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual parameters they need for their decision-making.",

                "Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by owners or by units they oversee, and the agents responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners).",
                "In this domain, scheduling information and constraints are distributed.",
                "Each agent receives a different view of the tasks and structures that constitute the full multi-agent problem-typically only a partial, local one.",
                "Schedule revisions that affect more than one agent must be coordinated, so agents thus must share certain kinds of information. (In a team context they may be designed to share other types as well.)",
                "However, the fast-paced nature of the domain constrains the amount of information they can share, precluding a centralized solution; scheduling problems must be solved distributively.",
                "The agent-owner relationship is a collaborative one, with the agent needing to interact with its owner to obtain task and environment information relevant to scheduling.",

                "The values of P, V , and C are time-varying, and the CA estimates their value at the intended time of initiating the interaction with its owner.",
                "This paper focuses on the twin problems of estimating the parameters P and C, both of which are user-centric in the sense of being determined by characteristics of the owner and the environment in which the owner is operating); it presumes a mechanism for determining V [18]. 2.1 Estimating Interruption Costs The cost of interrupting owners derives from the potential degradation in performance of tasks they are doing caused by the disruption [1; 9, inter alia].",
                "Research on interaction management has deployed sensor-based statistical models of human interruptibility to infer the degree of distraction likely to be caused by an interruption.",
                "This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying interruptions to times that are convenient.",
                "It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a users current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions.",
                "By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the users attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a users attention and intentions [9].",
                "Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5].",
                "Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions.",
                "First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider.",
                "Second, the interruptibility-estimation models are task-based.",
                "Lastly, it relies on continuous monitoring of a users activities.",
                "In fast-paced environments, there usually is no single task structure, and some of the activities themselves may have little internal structure.",
                "As a result, it is difficult to determine the actual attentional state of agent-owners [15].",
                "In such settings, owners must make complex decisions that typically involve a number of other members of their units, while remaining reactive to events that diverge from expectations [24].",

                "The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors.",
                "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
                "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
                "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",
                "Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.",
                "The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem.",
                "The CAs cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owners interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized.",
                "In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or maximize expected utility.",
                "The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function.",
                "We use a sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages.",
                "The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn.",
                "In particular, we consider the situation in which an agents owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x).",

                "Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption.",
                "This indirect approach, which does not require interrupting the user, is especially useful in fast-paced domains.",
                "The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method: ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information.",
                "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",
                "Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.",
                "Given occasional updates about its owners level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs.",
                "Denoting the probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy.

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The more observations an agent can accumulate about the distribution of the frequency of an owners interaction with the environment at a given time, the better it can estimate the probability the owner has the information needed by the system. 3.",

                "We first explain the need for increasing the number of observations used as the basis of estimation and then present a method for determining how much data to adopt from other agents.",
                "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
                "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
                "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",
                "For example, Figure 2 illustrates the reservation-value-based cost calculated according to observations received from an owner with a uniform interruption cost distribution U(0, 100) as a function of the number of accumulated observations used for generating the distribution histogram. (In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5).",
                "Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function.",
                "Eventually this method yields a very accurate estimation for the expected interruption cost.",
                "However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value.",
                "This error could seriously degrade the CAs decision making process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions.",
                "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",
                "One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents.",
                "Such an approach depends on identifying other owners with distribution functions for the characteristic of interest similar to the CAs owner.",
                "This dataaugmentation idea is simple: different owners may exhibit similar basic behaviors or patterns in similar fast-paced task scenarios.",
                "Since they are all coordinating on a common overall task and are operating in the same environment, it is reasonable to assume some level of similarity in the distribution function of their modeled parameters.",
                "People vary in their behavior, so, obviously, there may be different types of owners: some will emphasize communication with their teams, and some will spend more time on map-based planning; some will dislike being disturbed while trying to evaluate their teams progress, while others may be more open to interruptions.",
                "Consequently, an owners CA is likely to be able to find some CAs that are working with owners who are similar to its owner.",
                "When adopting data collected by other agents, the two main questions are which agents the CA should rely on and to what extent it should rely on each of them.",
                "The <br>selective-sharing</br> mechanism relies on a statistical measure of similarity that allows the CA of any specific user to identify the similarity between its owner and other owners dynamically.",
                "Based on this similarity level, the CA decides if and to what degree to import other CAs data in order to augment its direct observations, and thus to enable better modeling of its owners characteristics.",
                "It is notable that the cost of transferring observations between different CA modules of different agents is relatively small.",
                "This information can be transferred as part of regular negotiation communication between agents.",
                "The volume of such communication is negligible: it involves just the transmission of new observations values.",
                "In our learning mechanism, the CA constantly updates its estimation of the level of similarity between its owner and the owners represented by other CAs in the environment.",
                "Each new observation obtained either by that CA or any of the other CAs updates this estimation.",

                "The number of additional observations to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the similarity between its owner and other owners.",
                "In most cases, the number of observations the CA will want to take from another agent is smaller than the overall number of observations the other agent has; thus, it randomly samples (without repetitions) the required number of observations from this other agents database.",

                "Two additional advantages of a non-parametric approach are their usefulness for dealing with unexpected, outlying observations (possibly problematic for a parametric approach), and the fact that non-parametric approaches are computationally very simple and thus ideal for settings in which computational resources are scarce.",

                "Obviously, if the CA can identify another owner who has identical characteristics to the owner it represents, then it should use all of the observations collected by that owners agent.",

                "To avoid undesirable bias in relatively heterogeneous environments while effectively using relevant data to improve its estimations, the mechanism weighs the contributions of other agents observations based on a real-time estimation of the level of similarity between each of these agents and itself.",

                "INTRODUCTION For many real-world scenarios, autonomous agents need to operate in dynamic, uncertain environments in which they have only incomplete information about the results of their actions and characteristics of other agents or people with whom they need to cooperate or collaborate.",
                "In such environments, agents can benefit from sharing information they gather, pooling their individual experiences to improve their estimations of unknown parameters required for reasoning about actions under uncertainty.",
                "This paper addresses the problem of learning the distribution of the values of a probabilistic parameter that represents a characteristic of a person who is interacting with a computer agent.",
                "The characteristic to be learned is (or is clearly related to) an important factor in the agents decision making.1 The basic setting we consider is one in which an agent accumulates observations about a specific user characteristic and uses them to produce a timely estimate of some measure that depends on that characteristics distribution.",
                "The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames.",
                "Typically, agents must make decisions in real time, concurrent with task execution, and in the midst of great uncertainty.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we use the term fast-paced to refer to such environments.",
                "In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions.",
                "Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.",
                "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
                "That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",
                "In such environments, an agents individually acquired data (its own observations) are too sparse for it to obtain good estimations in the requisite time frame.",
                "Given the no-structure-constraint of the environment, approaches that depend on structured distributions may result in a significantly high estimation bias.",
                "We consider this problem in the context of a multi-agent distributed system in which computer agents support people who are carrying out complex tasks in a dynamic environment.",
                "The fact that agents are part of a multi-agent setting, in which other agents may 1 Learning the distribution rather than just determining some value in the distribution is important whenever the overall shape of the distribution and not just such individual features as mean are important. also be gathering data to estimate a similar characteristic of their users, offers the possibility for an agent to augment its own observations with those of other agents, thus improving the accuracy of its learning process.",
                "Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate.",
                "Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given agent depends on the extent to which their users characteristics distributions are correlated with that of this agents user.",
                "There is no guarantee that the distribution for two different agents is highly, positively correlated, let alone that they are the same.",
                "Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a learning mechanism must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation.",
                "The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work.",
                "However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-agent settings in which agents are collecting data that overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets).",
                "In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual parameters they need for their decision-making.",
                "In this paper, we present a mechanism that was used for learning key user characteristics in fast-paced environments.",
                "The mechanism provides relatively accurate estimations within short time frames by augmenting an individual agents direct observations with observations obtained by other agents with which it is coordinating.",
                "In particular, we focus on the related problems of estimating the cost of interrupting a person and estimating the probability that that person will have the information required by the system.",
                "Our adaptive approach, which we will refer to throughout the paper as selective-sharing, allows our CA to improve the accuracy of its distribution-based estimations in comparison to relying only on the interactions with a specific user (subsequently, self-learning) or pooling all data unconditionally (average all), in particular when the number of available observations is relatively small.",
                "The mechanism was successfully tested using a system that simulates a Coordinators environment.",

                "In this domain, autonomous agents, called Coordinators, are intended to help maximize an overall team objective by handling changes in the task schedule as conditions of operation change.",
                "Each agent operates on behalf of its owner (e.g., the team leader of a firstresponse team or a unit commander) whose schedule it manages.",
                "Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by owners or by units they oversee, and the agents responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners).",
                "In this domain, scheduling information and constraints are distributed.",
                "Each agent receives a different view of the tasks and structures that constitute the full multi-agent problem-typically only a partial, local one.",
                "Schedule revisions that affect more than one agent must be coordinated, so agents thus must share certain kinds of information. (In a team context they may be designed to share other types as well.)",
                "However, the fast-paced nature of the domain constrains the amount of information they can share, precluding a centralized solution; scheduling problems must be solved distributively.",
                "The agent-owner relationship is a collaborative one, with the agent needing to interact with its owner to obtain task and environment information relevant to scheduling.",
                "The CA module is responsible for deciding intelligently when and how to interact with the owner for improving the agents scheduling.",
                "As a result, the CA must estimate the expected benefit of any such interaction and the cost associated with it [19].",
                "In general, the net benefit of a potential interaction is PV − C, where V is the value of the information the user may have, P is the probability that the user has this information, and C is the cost associated with an interaction.",
                "The values of P, V , and C are time-varying, and the CA estimates their value at the intended time of initiating the interaction with its owner.",
                "This paper focuses on the twin problems of estimating the parameters P and C, both of which are user-centric in the sense of being determined by characteristics of the owner and the environment in which the owner is operating); it presumes a mechanism for determining V [18]. 2.1 Estimating Interruption Costs The cost of interrupting owners derives from the potential degradation in performance of tasks they are doing caused by the disruption [1; 9, inter alia].",
                "Research on interaction management has deployed sensor-based statistical models of human interruptibility to infer the degree of distraction likely to be caused by an interruption.",
                "This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying interruptions to times that are convenient.",
                "It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a users current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions.",
                "By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the users attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a users attention and intentions [9].",
                "Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5].",
                "Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions.",
                "First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider.",
                "Second, the interruptibility-estimation models are task-based.",
                "Lastly, it relies on continuous monitoring of a users activities.",
                "In fast-paced environments, there usually is no single task structure, and some of the activities themselves may have little internal structure.",
                "As a result, it is difficult to determine the actual attentional state of agent-owners [15].",
                "In such settings, owners must make complex decisions that typically involve a number of other members of their units, while remaining reactive to events that diverge from expectations [24].",

                "Prior work has tracked users focus of attention using a range of devices, including those able to monitor gestures [8] and track eyegaze to identify focus of visual attention [13, 20], thus enabling estimations of cognitive load and physical indicators of performance degradation.",
                "The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors.",
                "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
                "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
                "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",
                "Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.",
                "The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem.",
                "The CAs cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owners interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized.",
                "In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or maximize expected utility.",
                "The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function.",
                "We use a sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages.",
                "The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn.",
                "In particular, we consider the situation in which an agents owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x).",
                "The agent can activate sensing devices to get an estimation of the interruption cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of operating the sensing devices for a single time unit.",
                "The CA module sets a reservation value and as long as the sensor-based observation x is greater than this reservation value, the CA will wait and re-sample the user for a new estimation.",
                "The expected cost, V (xrv), using such a strategy with reservation value xrv is described by Equation 1, V (xrv) = c + R xrv y=0 yf(y) F(xrv) , (1) which decomposes into two parts.",
                "The first part, c divided by F(xrv), represents the expected sampling cost.",
                "The second, the integral divided by F(xrv), represents the expected cost of interruption, because the expected number of search cycles is (random) geometric and the probability of success is F(xrv).",
                "Taking the derivative of the left-hand-side of Equation 1 and equating it to zero, yields the characteristics of the optimal reservation value, namely x∗ rv must satisfy, V (x∗ rv) = x∗ rv. (2) Substituting (2) in Equation 1 yields Equation 3 (after integration by parts) from which the optimal reservation value, x∗ rv, and consequently (from Equation 2) V (x∗ rv) can be computed. c = Z x∗ rv y=0 F(y) (3) This method, which depends on extracting the optimal sequence of sensor-based user sampling, relies heavily on the structure of the distribution function, f(x).",
                "However, we need only a portion of the distribution function, namely from the origin to the reservation value. (See Equation 1 and Figure 1.)",
                "Thus, when we consider sharing data, it is not necessary to rely on complete similarity in the distribution function of different users.",
                "For some parameters, including the users interruptibility level, it is enough to rely on similarity in the relevant portion of the distribution function.",
                "The implementation described in Sections 4-5 relies on this fact.",
                "Figure 1: The distribution structure affecting the expected costs calculation 2.2 Estimating the Probability of Having Information One way an agent can estimate the probability a user will have information it needs (e.g., will know at a specific interruption time, with some level of reliability, the actual outcome of a task currently being executed) is to rely on prior interactions with this user, calculating the ratio between the number of times the user had the information and the total number of interactions.",
                "Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption.",
                "This indirect approach, which does not require interrupting the user, is especially useful in fast-paced domains.",
                "The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method: ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information.",
                "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",
                "Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.",
                "Given occasional updates about its owners level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs.",
                "Denoting the probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy.

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The more observations an agent can accumulate about the distribution of the frequency of an owners interaction with the environment at a given time, the better it can estimate the probability the owner has the information needed by the system. 3.",
                "THE SELECTIVE-SHARING MECHANISM This section presents the selective-sharing mechanism by which the CA learns the distribution function of a probabilistic parameter by taking advantage of data collected by other CAs in its environment.",
                "We first explain the need for increasing the number of observations used as the basis of estimation and then present a method for determining how much data to adopt from other agents.",
                "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
                "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
                "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",
                "For example, Figure 2 illustrates the reservation-value-based cost calculated according to observations received from an owner with a uniform interruption cost distribution U(0, 100) as a function of the number of accumulated observations used for generating the distribution histogram. (In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5).",
                "Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function.",
                "Eventually this method yields a very accurate estimation for the expected interruption cost.",
                "However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value.",
                "This error could seriously degrade the CAs decision making process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions.",
                "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",
                "One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents.",
                "Such an approach depends on identifying other owners with distribution functions for the characteristic of interest similar to the CAs owner.",

                "INTRODUCTION For many real-world scenarios, autonomous agents need to operate in dynamic, uncertain environments in which they have only incomplete information about the results of their actions and characteristics of other agents or people with whom they need to cooperate or collaborate.",
                "In such environments, agents can benefit from sharing information they gather, pooling their individual experiences to improve their estimations of unknown parameters required for reasoning about actions under uncertainty.",
                "This paper addresses the problem of learning the distribution of the values of a probabilistic parameter that represents a characteristic of a person who is interacting with a computer agent.",
                "The characteristic to be learned is (or is clearly related to) an important factor in the agents decision making.1 The basic setting we consider is one in which an agent accumulates observations about a specific user characteristic and uses them to produce a timely estimate of some measure that depends on that characteristics distribution.",
                "The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames.",
                "Typically, agents must make decisions in real time, concurrent with task execution, and in the midst of great uncertainty.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we use the term fast-paced to refer to such environments.",
                "In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions.",
                "Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.",
                "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
                "That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",
                "In such environments, an agents individually acquired data (its own observations) are too sparse for it to obtain good estimations in the requisite time frame.",
                "Given the no-structure-constraint of the environment, approaches that depend on structured distributions may result in a significantly high estimation bias.",
                "We consider this problem in the context of a multi-agent distributed system in which computer agents support people who are carrying out complex tasks in a dynamic environment.",
                "The fact that agents are part of a multi-agent setting, in which other agents may 1 Learning the distribution rather than just determining some value in the distribution is important whenever the overall shape of the distribution and not just such individual features as mean are important. also be gathering data to estimate a similar characteristic of their users, offers the possibility for an agent to augment its own observations with those of other agents, thus improving the accuracy of its learning process.",
                "Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate.",
                "Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given agent depends on the extent to which their users characteristics distributions are correlated with that of this agents user.",
                "There is no guarantee that the distribution for two different agents is highly, positively correlated, let alone that they are the same.",
                "Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a learning mechanism must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation.",
                "The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work.",
                "However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-agent settings in which agents are collecting data that overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets).",
                "In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual parameters they need for their decision-making.",
                "In this paper, we present a mechanism that was used for learning key user characteristics in fast-paced environments.",
                "The mechanism provides relatively accurate estimations within short time frames by augmenting an individual agents direct observations with observations obtained by other agents with which it is coordinating.",
                "In particular, we focus on the related problems of estimating the cost of interrupting a person and estimating the probability that that person will have the information required by the system.",
                "Our adaptive approach, which we will refer to throughout the paper as selective-sharing, allows our CA to improve the accuracy of its distribution-based estimations in comparison to relying only on the interactions with a specific user (subsequently, self-learning) or pooling all data unconditionally (average all), in particular when the number of available observations is relatively small.",

                "Each agent operates on behalf of its owner (e.g., the team leader of a firstresponse team or a unit commander) whose schedule it manages.",
                "Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by owners or by units they oversee, and the agents responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners).",
                "In this domain, scheduling information and constraints are distributed.",
                "Each agent receives a different view of the tasks and structures that constitute the full multi-agent problem-typically only a partial, local one.",
                "Schedule revisions that affect more than one agent must be coordinated, so agents thus must share certain kinds of information. (In a team context they may be designed to share other types as well.)",
                "However, the fast-paced nature of the domain constrains the amount of information they can share, precluding a centralized solution; scheduling problems must be solved distributively.",
                "The agent-owner relationship is a collaborative one, with the agent needing to interact with its owner to obtain task and environment information relevant to scheduling.",
                "The CA module is responsible for deciding intelligently when and how to interact with the owner for improving the agents scheduling.",
                "As a result, the CA must estimate the expected benefit of any such interaction and the cost associated with it [19].",
                "In general, the net benefit of a potential interaction is PV − C, where V is the value of the information the user may have, P is the probability that the user has this information, and C is the cost associated with an interaction.",
                "The values of P, V , and C are time-varying, and the CA estimates their value at the intended time of initiating the interaction with its owner.",
                "This paper focuses on the twin problems of estimating the parameters P and C, both of which are user-centric in the sense of being determined by characteristics of the owner and the environment in which the owner is operating); it presumes a mechanism for determining V [18]. 2.1 Estimating Interruption Costs The cost of interrupting owners derives from the potential degradation in performance of tasks they are doing caused by the disruption [1; 9, inter alia].",
                "Research on interaction management has deployed sensor-based statistical models of human interruptibility to infer the degree of distraction likely to be caused by an interruption.",
                "This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying interruptions to times that are convenient.",
                "It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a users current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions.",
                "By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the users attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a users attention and intentions [9].",
                "Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5].",
                "Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions.",
                "First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider.",
                "Second, the interruptibility-estimation models are task-based.",
                "Lastly, it relies on continuous monitoring of a users activities.",
                "In fast-paced environments, there usually is no single task structure, and some of the activities themselves may have little internal structure.",
                "As a result, it is difficult to determine the actual attentional state of agent-owners [15].",
                "In such settings, owners must make complex decisions that typically involve a number of other members of their units, while remaining reactive to events that diverge from expectations [24].",
                "For instance, during disaster rescue, a first-response unit may begin rescuing survivors trapped in a burning house, when a wall collapses suddenly, forcing the unit to The Sixth Intl.",

                "Prior work has tracked users focus of attention using a range of devices, including those able to monitor gestures [8] and track eyegaze to identify focus of visual attention [13, 20], thus enabling estimations of cognitive load and physical indicators of performance degradation.",
                "The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors.",
                "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
                "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
                "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",
                "Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owners interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.",
                "The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem.",
                "The CAs cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owners interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized.",
                "In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or maximize expected utility.",
                "The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function.",
                "We use a sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages.",
                "The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn.",
                "In particular, we consider the situation in which an agents owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x).",
                "The agent can activate sensing devices to get an estimation of the interruption cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of operating the sensing devices for a single time unit.",
                "The CA module sets a reservation value and as long as the sensor-based observation x is greater than this reservation value, the CA will wait and re-sample the user for a new estimation.",
                "The expected cost, V (xrv), using such a strategy with reservation value xrv is described by Equation 1, V (xrv) = c + R xrv y=0 yf(y) F(xrv) , (1) which decomposes into two parts.",
                "The first part, c divided by F(xrv), represents the expected sampling cost.",
                "The second, the integral divided by F(xrv), represents the expected cost of interruption, because the expected number of search cycles is (random) geometric and the probability of success is F(xrv).",
                "Taking the derivative of the left-hand-side of Equation 1 and equating it to zero, yields the characteristics of the optimal reservation value, namely x∗ rv must satisfy, V (x∗ rv) = x∗ rv.

                "However, we need only a portion of the distribution function, namely from the origin to the reservation value. (See Equation 1 and Figure 1.)",
                "Thus, when we consider sharing data, it is not necessary to rely on complete similarity in the distribution function of different users.",
                "For some parameters, including the users interruptibility level, it is enough to rely on similarity in the relevant portion of the distribution function.",

                "Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable characteristics of the users behavior, which it can assess without requiring an interruption.",
                "This indirect approach, which does not require interrupting the user, is especially useful in fast-paced domains.",
                "The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method: ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information.",
                "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",
                "Thus, owners levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.",
                "Given occasional updates about its owners level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs.",
                "Denoting the probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy.

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The more observations an agent can accumulate about the distribution of the frequency of an owners interaction with the environment at a given time, the better it can estimate the probability the owner has the information needed by the system. 3.",

                "We first explain the need for increasing the number of observations used as the basis of estimation and then present a method for determining how much data to adopt from other agents.",
                "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
                "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
                "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",
                "For example, Figure 2 illustrates the reservation-value-based cost calculated according to observations received from an owner with a uniform interruption cost distribution U(0, 100) as a function of the number of accumulated observations used for generating the distribution histogram. (In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5).",
                "Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function.",
                "Eventually this method yields a very accurate estimation for the expected interruption cost.",
                "However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value.",
                "This error could seriously degrade the CAs decision making process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions.",
                "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",
                "One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents.",
                "Such an approach depends on identifying other owners with distribution functions for the characteristic of interest similar to the CAs owner.",
                "This dataaugmentation idea is simple: different owners may exhibit similar basic behaviors or patterns in similar fast-paced task scenarios.",
                "Since they are all coordinating on a common overall task and are operating in the same environment, it is reasonable to assume some level of similarity in the distribution function of their modeled parameters.",
                "People vary in their behavior, so, obviously, there may be different types of owners: some will emphasize communication with their teams, and some will spend more time on map-based planning; some will dislike being disturbed while trying to evaluate their teams progress, while others may be more open to interruptions.",
                "Consequently, an owners CA is likely to be able to find some CAs that are working with owners who are similar to its owner.",
                "When adopting data collected by other agents, the two main questions are which agents the CA should rely on and to what extent it should rely on each of them.",
                "The selective-sharing mechanism relies on a statistical measure of similarity that allows the CA of any specific user to identify the similarity between its owner and other owners dynamically.",
                "Based on this similarity level, the CA decides if and to what degree to import other CAs data in order to augment its direct observations, and thus to enable better modeling of its owners characteristics.",
                "It is notable that the cost of transferring observations between different CA modules of different agents is relatively small.",
                "This information can be transferred as part of regular negotiation communication between agents.",
                "The volume of such communication is negligible: it involves just the transmission of new observations values.",
                "In our learning mechanism, the CA constantly updates its estimation of the level of similarity between its owner and the owners represented by other CAs in the environment.",
                "Each new observation obtained either by that CA or any of the other CAs updates this estimation.",
                "The similarity level is determined using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Whenever it is necessary to produce a parameter estimate, the CA decides on the number of additional observations it intends to rely on for extracting its estimation.",
                "The number of additional observations to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the similarity between its owner and other owners.",
                "In most cases, the number of observations the CA will want to take from another agent is smaller than the overall number of observations the other agent has; thus, it randomly samples (without repetitions) the required number of observations from this other agents database.",
                "The additional observations the CA takes from other agents are used only to model its owners characteristics.",
                "Future similarity level determination is not affected by this information augmentation procedure. 3.1 The Wilcoxon Test We use a nonparametric method (i.e., one that makes no assumptions about the parametric form of the distributions each set is drawn from), because user characteristics in fast-paced domains do not have the structure needed for parametric approaches.",
                "Two additional advantages of a non-parametric approach are their usefulness for dealing with unexpected, outlying observations (possibly problematic for a parametric approach), and the fact that non-parametric approaches are computationally very simple and thus ideal for settings in which computational resources are scarce.",

                "The Wilcoxon test does not require that the data originates from a normally distributed population or that the distribution is characterized by a finite set of parameters. 3.2 Determining Required Information Correctly identifying the right number of additional observations to gather is a key determinant of success of the selective-sharing mechanism.",
                "Obviously, if the CA can identify another owner who has identical characteristics to the owner it represents, then it should use all of the observations collected by that owners agent.",
                "However, cases of identical matches are likely to be very uncommon.",
                "Furthermore, even to establish that another user is identical to its own, the CA would need substantial sample sizes to have a relatively high level of confidence.",

                "At the beginning of its process, the selective-sharing mechanism has almost no data to rely on, and thus no similarity measure can be used.",
                "In this case, the CA module relies heavily on other agents, in the expectation that all owners have some basic level of similarity in their distribution (see Section 2).",
                "As the number of its direct observations increases, the CA module refines the number of additional observations required.",
                "Again, there are two conflicting effects.",

                "On the other hand, assuming there is some difference among owners (even if not noticed yet), as the number of its direct observations increases, the owners own data should gain weight in its analysis.",
                "Therefore, when CAi decides how many additional observations, Oi j should be adopted from CAjs database, it calculates Oi j as follows: Oi j = N ∗ (1 − αi,j) √ N + 2 + ln(N) N (5) where N is the number of observations CAi already has (which is similar in magnitude to the number of observations CAj has) and αi,j is the confidence of rejecting the Wilcoxon null hypothesis.",
                "The function in Equation 5 ensures that the number of additional observations to be taken from another CA module increases as the confidence in the similarity with the source for these additional observations increases.",

                "In such environments, agents can benefit from sharing information they gather, pooling their individual experiences to improve their estimations of unknown parameters required for reasoning about actions under uncertainty.",
                "This paper addresses the problem of learning the distribution of the values of a probabilistic parameter that represents a characteristic of a person who is interacting with a computer agent.",
                "The characteristic to be learned is (or is clearly related to) an important factor in the agents decision making.1 The basic setting we consider is one in which an agent accumulates observations about a specific user characteristic and uses them to produce a timely estimate of some measure that depends on that characteristics distribution.",
                "The mechanisms we develop are designed to be useful in a range of application domains, such as disaster rescue, that are characterized by environments in which conditions may be rapidly changing, actions (whether of autonomous agents or of people) and the overall operations occur at a fast pace, and decisions must be made within tightly constrained time frames.",
                "Typically, agents must make decisions in real time, concurrent with task execution, and in the midst of great uncertainty.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we use the term fast-paced to refer to such environments.",
                "In fast-paced environments, information gathering may be limited, and it is not possible to learn offline or to wait until large amounts of data are collected before making decisions.",
                "Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated parameters distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.",
                "Thus, the goal of the estimation methods presented in this paper is to minimize the average error over time, rather than to determine an accurate value at the end of a long period of interaction.",
                "That is, the agent is expected to work with the user for a limited time, and it attempts to minimize the overall error in its estimations.",
                "In such environments, an agents individually acquired data (its own observations) are too sparse for it to obtain good estimations in the requisite time frame.",
                "Given the no-structure-constraint of the environment, approaches that depend on structured distributions may result in a significantly high estimation bias.",

                "The fact that agents are part of a multi-agent setting, in which other agents may 1 Learning the distribution rather than just determining some value in the distribution is important whenever the overall shape of the distribution and not just such individual features as mean are important. also be gathering data to estimate a similar characteristic of their users, offers the possibility for an agent to augment its own observations with those of other agents, thus improving the accuracy of its learning process.",
                "Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate.",
                "Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given agent depends on the extent to which their users characteristics distributions are correlated with that of this agents user.",
                "There is no guarantee that the distribution for two different agents is highly, positively correlated, let alone that they are the same.",
                "Therefore, to use a data-sharing approach, a learning mechanism must be capable of effectively identifying the level of correlation between the data collected by different agents and to weigh shared data depending on the level of correlation.",
                "The design of a coordination autonomy (CA) module within a coordination-manager system (as part of the DARPA Coordinators project [18]), in which agents support a distributed scheduling task, provided the initial motivation and a conceptual setting for this work.",
                "However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-agent settings in which agents are collecting data that overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets).",
                "In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual parameters they need for their decision-making.",
                "In this paper, we present a mechanism that was used for learning key user characteristics in fast-paced environments.",
                "The mechanism provides relatively accurate estimations within short time frames by augmenting an individual agents direct observations with observations obtained by other agents with which it is coordinating.",
                "In particular, we focus on the related problems of estimating the cost of interrupting a person and estimating the probability that that person will have the information required by the system.",
                "Our adaptive approach, which we will refer to throughout the paper as selective-sharing, allows our CA to improve the accuracy of its distribution-based estimations in comparison to relying only on the interactions with a specific user (subsequently, self-learning) or pooling all data unconditionally (average all), in particular when the number of available observations is relatively small.",

                "Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to balance the interactions estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible solutions.",

                "However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents resources are severely limited.",
                "Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a persons attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.",
                "Thus, at any given time, the cost of interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.",

                "For instance, in Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open communications they overhear (e.g. if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].",

                "The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the distribution functions associated with the different parameters characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.",
                "Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).",
                "The accuracy of the estimation will vary widely if it is based on only a small number of observations.",
                "For example, Figure 2 illustrates the reservation-value-based cost calculated according to observations received from an owner with a uniform interruption cost distribution U(0, 100) as a function of the number of accumulated observations used for generating the distribution histogram. (In this simulation, device activation cost was taken to be c = 0.5).",
                "Figure 2: The convergence of a single CA to its optimal strategy These deviations from the actual (true) value (which is 10 in this case, according to Equation 3) is because the sample used in each stage cannot accurately capture the actual structure of the distribution function.",

                "However, in the initial stages of the process, its estimation deviates significantly from the true value.",
                "This error could seriously degrade the CAs decision making process: underestimating the cost may result in initiating costly, non-beneficial interactions, and overestimating the cost might result in missing opportunities for valuable interactions.",
                "Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in fastpaced domains.",
                "One way to decrease the deviation from the actual value is by augmenting the data the CA acquires by observing its owner with observations made by other owners agents.",

                "This dataaugmentation idea is simple: different owners may exhibit similar basic behaviors or patterns in similar fast-paced task scenarios.",
                "Since they are all coordinating on a common overall task and are operating in the same environment, it is reasonable to assume some level of similarity in the distribution function of their modeled parameters.",
                "People vary in their behavior, so, obviously, there may be different types of owners: some will emphasize communication with their teams, and some will spend more time on map-based planning; some will dislike being disturbed while trying to evaluate their teams progress, while others may be more open to interruptions.",

                "It is notable that the cost of transferring observations between different CA modules of different agents is relatively small.",
                "This information can be transferred as part of regular negotiation communication between agents.",
                "The volume of such communication is negligible: it involves just the transmission of new observations values.",

                "The number of additional observations to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the similarity between its owner and other owners.",
                "In most cases, the number of observations the CA will want to take from another agent is smaller than the overall number of observations the other agent has; thus, it randomly samples (without repetitions) the required number of observations from this other agents database.",

                "Two additional advantages of a non-parametric approach are their usefulness for dealing with unexpected, outlying observations (possibly problematic for a parametric approach), and the fact that non-parametric approaches are computationally very simple and thus ideal for settings in which computational resources are scarce.",

                "Furthermore, the more user observations the agents accumulate (i.e., as we extend the horizontal axis), the better the other two methods are in comparison to average-all.",
                "In the long run (and as shown in the following subsection for the general case), the average-all method exhibits the worst performance.",
                "Second, the selective-sharing mechanism starts with a significant improvement in comparison to relying on the agents own observations, and then this improvement gradually decreases until finally its performance curve coincides with the self-learning methods curve.",
                "The selective-sharing mechanism performs better or worse, depending on the type, because the Wilcoxon test cannot guarantee an exact identification of similarity; different combinations of distribution function can result in an inability to exactly identify the similar users for some of the specific types.",
                "For example, for type I agents, the selective-sharing mechanism actually performs worse than self-learning in the short term (in the long run the two methods performance converge).",
                "Nevertheless, for the other types in our example, the selective-sharing mechanism is the most efficient one, and outperforms the other two methods overall.",
                "Third, it is notable that for agents that have a unique type (e.g., agent III), the selective-sharing mechanism quickly converges towards relying on self-collected data.",
                "This behavior guarantees that even in scenarios in which users are completely different, the method exhibits a graceful initial degradation but manages, within a few time steps, to adopt the proper behavior of counting exclusively on self-generated data.",
                "Last, despite the difference in their overall distribution function, agents of type IV and V exhibit similar performance because the relevant portion of their distribution functions (i.e., the effective parts that affect the RV calculation as explained in Figure 1) is identical.",
                "Thus, the selective-sharing mechanism enables the agent of type V, despite its unique distribution function, to adopt relevant information collected by agents of types IV which improves its estimation of the expected interruption cost. 5.2 General Evaluation To evaluate selective-sharing, we ran a series of simulations in which the environment was randomly generated.",
