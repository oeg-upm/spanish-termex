In particular, they usually offer no concept for expressing that some course of events is more likely to happen than another. We address this problem and extend CTLK (computation tree logic with knowledge) with a notion of plausibility, which allows for practical and counterfactual reasoning. The new logic CTLKP (CTLK with plausibility) includes also a particular notion of belief. A plausibility update operator is added to this logic in order to change plausibility assumptions dynamically. Furthermore, we examine some important properties of these concepts. In particular, we show that, for a natural class of models, belief is a KD45 modality. We also show that model checking CTLKP is PTIME-complete and can be done in time linear with respect to the size of models and formulae.

INTRODUCTION Notions like time, knowledge, and beliefs are very important for analyzing the behavior of agents and multi-agent systems. In this paper, we extend modal logics of time and knowledge with a concept of plausible behavior: this notion is added to the language of CTLK [19], which is a straightforward combination of the branching-time temporal logic CTL [4, 3] and standard epistemic logic [9, 5]. In our approach, plausibility can be seen as a temporal property of behaviors. That is, some behaviors of the system can be assumed plausible and others implausible, with the underlying idea that the latter should perhaps be ignored in practical reasoning about possible future courses of action. Moreover, behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the Kripke structure modeling a multiagent system. As a consequence, we obtain a language to reason about what can (or must) plausibly happen. We propose a particular notion of beliefs (inspired by [20, 7]), defined in terms of epistemic relations and plausibility. The main intuition is that beliefs are facts that an agent would know if he assumed that only plausible things could happen. We believe that humans use such a concept of plausibility and practical beliefs quite often in their everyday reasoning. Restricting ones reasoning to plausible possibilities is essential to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all possibilities is exceedingly large in real life. We investigate some important properties of plausibility, knowledge, and belief in this new framework. In particular, we show that knowledge is an S5 modality, and that beliefs satisfy axioms K45 in general, and KD45 for the class of plausibly serial models. Finally, we show that the relationship between knowledge and belief for plausibly serial models is natural and reflects the initial intuition well. We also show how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility update operator, and we study properties of such updates. Finally, we show that model checking of the new logic is no more complex than model checking CTL and CTLK. Our ultimate goal is to come up with a logic that allows the study of strategies, time, knowledge, and plausible/rational behavior under both perfect and imperfect information. As combining all these dimensions is highly nontrivial (cf. [12, 14]) it seems reasonable to split this task. While this paper deals with knowledge, plausibility, and belief, the companion paper [11] proposes a general framework for multi-agent systems that regard game-theoretical rationality criteria like Nash equilibrium, Pareto optimality, etc. The latter approach is based on the more powerful logic ATL [1]. The paper is structured as follows. Firstly, we briefly present branching-time logic with knowledge, CTLK. In Section 3 we present our approach to plausibility and formally define CTLK with plausibility. We also show how 582 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS temporal formulae can be used to describe plausible paths, and we compare our logic with existing related work. In Section 4, properties of knowledge, belief, and plausibility are explored. Finally, we present verification complexity results for CTLKP in Section 5. 2. BRANCHING TIME AND KNOWLEDGE In this paper we develop a framework for agents beliefs about how the world can (or must) evolve. Thus, we need a notion of time and change, plus a notion of what the agents are supposed to know in particular situations. CTLK [19] is a straightforward combination of the computation tree logic CTL [4, 3] and standard epistemic logic [9, 5]. CTL includes operators for temporal properties of systems: i.e., path quantifier E (there is a path), together with temporal operators: f(in the next state), 2 (always from now on) and U (until).1 Every occurrence of a temporal operator is preceded by exactly one path quantifier in CTL (this variant of the language is sometimes called vanilla CTL). Epistemic logic uses operators for representing agents knowledge: Kaϕ is read as agent a knows that ϕ. Let Π be a set of atomic propositions with a typical element p, and Agt = {1, ..., k} be a set of agents with a typical element a. The language of CTLK consists of formulae ϕ, given as follows: ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Eγ | Kaϕ γ ::= fϕ | 2 ϕ | ϕU ϕ. We will sometimes refer to formulae ϕ as (vanilla) state formulae and to formulae γ as (vanilla) path formulae. The semantics of CTLK is based on Kripke models M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, π , which include a nonempty set of states Q, a state transition relation R ⊆ Q × Q, epistemic indistinguishability relations ∼a⊆ Q × Q (one per agent), and a valuation of propositions π : Π → P(Q). We assume that relation R is serial and that all ∼a are equivalence relations. A path λ in M refers to a possible behavior (or computation) of system M, and can be represented as an infinite sequence of states that follow relation R, that is, a sequence q0q1q2... such that qiRqi+1 for every i = 0, 1, 2, ... We denote the ith state in λ by λ[i]. The set of all paths in M is denoted by ΛM (if the model is clear from context, M will be omitted). A q-path is a path that starts from q, i.e., λ[0] = q. A q-subpath is a sequence of states, starting from q, which is a subpath of some path in the model, i.e. a sequence q0q1... such that q = q0 and there are q0 , ..., qi such that q0 ...qi q0q1... ∈ ΛM.2 The semantics of CTLK is defined as follows: M, q |= p iff q ∈ π(p); M, q |= ¬ϕ iff M, q |= ϕ; M, q |= ϕ ∧ ψ iff M, q |= ϕ and M, q |= ψ; M, q |= E fϕ iff there is a q-path λ such that M, λ[1] |= ϕ; M, q |= E2 ϕ iff there is a q-path λ such that M, λ[i] |= ϕ for every i ≥ 0; 1 Additional operators A (for every path) and ♦ (sometime in the future) are defined in the usual way. 2 For CTLK models, λ is a q-subpath iff it is a q-path. It will not always be so when plausible paths are introduced. M, q |= EϕU ψ iff there is a q-path λ and i ≥ 0 such that M, λ[i] |= ψ, and M, λ[j] |= ϕ for every 0 ≤ j < i; M, q |= Kaϕ iff M, q |= ϕ for every q such that q ∼a q . 3. EXTENDING TIME AND KNOWLEDGE WITH PLAUSIBILITY AND BELIEFS In this section we discuss the central concept of this paper, i.e. the concept of plausibility. First, we outline the idea informally. Then, we extend CTLK with the notion of plausibility by adding plausible path operators Pl a and physical path operator Ph to the logic. Formula Pl aϕ has the intended meaning: according to agent a, it is plausible that ϕ holds; formula Ph ϕ reads as: ϕ holds in all physically possible scenarios (i.e., even in implausible ones). The plausible path operator restricts statements only to those paths which are defined to be sensible, whereas the physical path operator generates statements about all paths that may theoretically occur. Furthermore, we define beliefs on top of plausibility and knowledge, as the facts that an agent would know if he assumed that only plausible things could happen. Finally, we discuss related work [7, 8, 20, 18, 16], and compare it with our approach. 3.1 The Concept of Plausibility It is well known how knowledge (or beliefs) can be modeled with Kripke structures. However, it is not so obvious how we can capture knowledge and beliefs in a sensible way in one framework. Clearly, there should be a connection between these two notions. Our approach is to use the notion of plausibility for this purpose. Plausibility can serve as a primitive concept that helps to define the semantics of beliefs, in a similar way as indistinguishability of states (represented by relation ∼a) is the semantic concept that underlies knowledge. In this sense, our work follows [7, 20]: essentially, beliefs are what an agent would know if he took only plausible options into account. In our approach, however, plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property. That is, we do not consider states (or possible worlds) to be more plausible than others but rather define some behaviors to be plausible, and others implausible. Moreover, behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the Kripke structure modeling a multi-agent system. An actual notion of plausibility (that is, a particular set of plausible paths) can emerge in many different ways. It may result from observations and learning; an agent can learn from its observations and see specific patterns of events as plausible (a lot of people wear black shoes if they wear a suit). Knowledge exchange is another possibility (e.g., an agent a can tell agent b that player c always bluffs when he is smiling). Game theory, with its rationality criteria (undominated strategies, maxmin, Nash equilibrium etc.) is another viable source of plausibility assumptions. Last but not least, folk knowledge can be used to establish plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior (players normally want to win a game, people want to live). In any case, restricting the reasoning to plausible possibilities can be essential if we want to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all possibilities (we call them physical possibilities in the rest of the paper) is exceedingly large in real life. Of course, this does not exclude a more extensive analysis in special cases, e.g. when our plausibility assumptions do not seem accurate any more, or when the cost of The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 583 inaccurate assumptions can be too high (as in the case of high-budget business decisions). But even in these cases, we usually do not get rid of plausibility assumptions completely - we only revise them to make them more cautious.3 To formalize this idea, we extend models of CTLK with sets of plausible paths and add plausibility operators Pl a, physical paths operator Ph , and belief operators Ba to the language of CTLK. Now, it is possible to make statements that refer to plausible paths only, as well as statements that regard all paths that may occur in the system. 3.2 CTLK with Plausibility In this section, we extend the logic of CTLK with plausibility; we call the resulting logic CTLKP. Formally, the language of CTLKP is defined as: ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Eγ | Pl aϕ | Ph ϕ | Kaϕ | Baϕ γ ::= fϕ | 2 ϕ | ϕU ϕ. For instance, we may claim it is plausible to assume that a shop is closed after the opening hours, though the manager may be physically able to open it at any time: Pl aA2 (late → ¬open) ∧ Ph E♦ (late ∧ open). The semantics of CTLKP extends that of CTLK as follows. Firstly, we augment the models with sets of plausible paths. A model with plausibility is given as M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Υ1, ..., Υk, π , where Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, π is a CTLK model, and Υa ⊆ ΛM is the set of paths in M that are plausible according to agent a. If we want to make it clear that Υa is taken from model M, we will write ΥM a . It seems worth emphasizing that this notion of plausibility is subjective and holistic. It is subjective because Υa represents agent as subjective view on what is plausible - and indeed, different agents may have different ideas on plausibility (i.e., Υa may differ from Υb). It is holistic because Υa represents agent as idea of the plausible behavior of the whole system (including the behavior of other agents). Remark 1. In our models, plausibility is also global, i.e., plausibility sets do not depend on the state of the system. Investigating systems, in which plausibility is relativized with respect to states (like in [7]), might be an interesting avenue of future work. However, such an approach - while obviously more flexible - allows for potentially counterintuitive system descriptions. For example, it might be the case that path λ is plausible in q = λ[0], but the set of plausible paths in q = λ[1] is empty. That is, by following plausible path λ we are bound to get to an implausible situation. But then, does it make sense to consider λ as plausible? Secondly, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P , which we call plausible satisfaction. Let M be a CTLKP 3 That is, when planning to open an industrial plant in the UK, we will probably consider the possibility of our main contractor taking her life, but we will still not take into account the possibilities of: an invasion of UFO, England being destroyed by a meteorite, Fidel Castro becoming the British Prime Minister etc. Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case, they also have a very small influence on our final decision, but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options. model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M (not necessarily any ΥM a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only. The absolute satisfaction relation |= is defined as |=ΛM . Let on(P) be the set of all states that lie on at least one path in P, i.e. on(P) = {q ∈ Q | ∃λ ∈ P∃i (λ[i] = q)}. Now, the semantics of CTLKP can be given through the following clauses: M, q |=P p iff q ∈ π(p); M, q |=P ¬ϕ iff M, q |=P ϕ; M, q |=P ϕ ∧ ψ iff M, q |=P ϕ and M, q |=P ψ; M, q |=P E fϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[1] |=P ϕ; M, q |=P E2 ϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[i] |=P ϕ for every i ≥ 0; M, q |=P EϕU ψ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P and i ≥ 0 such that M, λ[i] |=P ψ, and M, λ[j] |=P ϕ for every 0 ≤ j < i; M, q |=P Pl aϕ iff M, q |=Υa ϕ; M, q |=P Ph ϕ iff M, q |= ϕ; M, q |=P Kaϕ iff M, q |= ϕ for every q such that q ∼a q ; M, q |=P Baϕ iff for all q ∈ on(Υa) with q ∼a q , we have that M, q |=Υa ϕ. One of the main reasons for using the concept of plausibility is that we want to define agents beliefs out of more primitive concepts - in our case, these are plausibility and indistinguishability - in a way analogous to [20, 7]. If an agent knows that ϕ, he must be sure about it. However, beliefs of an agent are not necessarily about reliable facts. Still, they should make sense to the agent; if he believes that ϕ, then the formula should at least hold in all futures that he envisages as plausible. Thus, beliefs of an agent may be seen as things known to him if he disregards all non-plausible possibilities. We say that ϕ is M-true (M |= ϕ) if M, q |= ϕ for all q ∈ QM. ϕ is valid (|= ϕ) if M |= ϕ for all models M. ϕ is M-strongly true (M |≡ ϕ) if M, q |=P ϕ for all q ∈ QM and all P ⊆ ΛM. ϕ is strongly valid ( |≡ ϕ) if M |≡ ϕ for all models M. Proposition 2. Strong truth and strong validity imply truth and validity, respectively. The reverse does not hold. Ultimately, we are going to be interested in normal (not strong) validity, as parameterizing the satisfaction relation with a set P is just a technical device for propagating sets of plausible paths Υa into the semantics of nested formulae. The importance of strong validity, however, lies in the fact that |≡ ϕ ↔ ψ makes ϕ and ψ completely interchangeable, while the same is not true for normal validity. Proposition 3. Let Φ[ϕ/ψ] denote formula Φ in which every occurrence of ψ was replaced by ϕ. Also, let |≡ ϕ ↔ ψ. Then for all M, q, P: M, q |=P Φ iff M, q |=P Φ[ϕ/ψ] (in particular, M, q |= Φ iff M, q |= Φ[ϕ/ψ]). Note that |= ϕ ↔ ψ does not even imply that M, q |= Φ iff M, q |= Φ[ϕ/ψ]. 584 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Figure 1: Guessing Robots game Example 1 (Guessing Robots). Consider a simple game with two agents a and b, shown in Figure 1. First, a chooses a real number r ∈ [0, 1] (without revealing the number to b); then, b chooses a real number r ∈ [0, 1]. The agents win the game (and collect EUR 1, 000, 000) if both chose 1, otherwise they lose. Formally, we model the game with a CTLKP model M, in which the set of states Q includes qs for the initial situation, states qr, r ∈ [0, 1], for the situations after a has chosen number r, and final states qw, ql for the winning and the losing situation, respectively. The transition relation is as follows: qsRqr and qrRql for all r ∈ [0, 1]; q1Rqw, qwRqw, and qlRql. Moreover, π(one) = {q1} and π(win) = {qw}. Player a has perfect information in the game (i.e., q ∼a q iff q = q ), but player b does not distinguish between states qr (i.e., qr ∼b qr for all r, r ∈ [0, 1]). Obviously, the only sensible thing to do for both agents is to choose 1 (using game-theoretical vocabulary, these strategies are strongly dominant for the respective players). Thus, there is only one plausible course of events if we assume that our players are rational, and hence Υa = Υb = {qsq1qwqw . . .}. Note that, in principle, the outcome of the game is uncertain: M, qs |= ¬A♦ win∧¬A2 ¬win. However, assuming rationality of the players makes it only plausible that the game must end up with a win: M, qs |= Pla A♦ win ∧ Plb A♦ win, and the agents believe that this will be the case: M, qs |= BaA♦ win ∧ BbA♦ win. Note also that, in any of the states qr, agent b believes that a (being rational) has played 1: M, qr |= Bbone for all r ∈ [0, 1]. 3.3 Defining Plausible Paths with Formulae So far, we have assumed that sets of plausible paths are somehow given in models. In this section we present a dynamic approach where an actual notion of plausibility can be specified in the object language. Note that we want to specify (usually infinite) sets of infinite paths, and we need a finite representation of these structures. One logical solution is given by using path formulae γ. These formulae describe properties of paths; therefore, a specific formula can be used to characterize a set of paths. For instance, think about a country in Africa where it has never snowed. Then, plausible paths might be defined as ones in which it never snows, i.e., all paths that satisfy 2 ¬snows. Formally, let γ be a CTLK path formula. We define |γ|M to be the set of paths that satisfy γ in model M: | fϕ|M = {λ | M, λ[1] |= ϕ} |2 ϕ|M = {λ | ∀i (M, λ[i] |= ϕ)} |ϕ1U ϕ2|M = {λ | ∃i ` M, λ[i] |= ϕ2 ∧ ∀j(0 ≤ j < i ⇒ M, λ[j] |= ϕ1) ´ }. Moreover, we define the plausible paths model update as follows. Let M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Υ1, ..., Υk, π be a CTLKP model, and let P ⊆ ΛM be a set of paths. Then Ma,P = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Υ1, ..., Υa−1, P, Υa+1, ..., Υk, π denotes model M with as set of plausible paths reset to P. Now we can extend the language of CTLKP with formulae (set-pla γ)ϕ with the intuitive reading: suppose that γ exactly characterizes the set of plausible paths, then ϕ holds, and formal semantics given below: M, q |=P (set-pla γ)ϕ iff Ma,|γ|M , q |=P ϕ. We observe that this update scheme is similar to the one proposed in [13]. 3.4 Comparison to Related Work Several modal notions of plausibility were already discussed in the existing literature [7, 8, 20, 18, 16]. In these papers, like in ours, plausibility is used as a primitive semantic concept that helps to define beliefs on top of agents knowledge. A similar idea was introduced by Moses and Shoham in [18]. Their work preceded both [7, 8] and [20]and although Moses and Shoham do not explicitly mention the term plausibility, it seems appropriate to summarize their idea first. Moses and Shoham: Beliefs as Conditional Knowledge In [18], beliefs are relativized with respect to a formula α (which can be seen as a plausibility assumption expressed in the object language). More precisely, worlds that satisfy α can be considered as plausible. This concept is expressed via symbols Bα i ϕ; the index i ∈ {1, 2, 3} is used to distinguish between three different implementations of beliefs. The first version is given by Bα 1 ϕ ≡ K(α → ϕ).4 A drawback of this version is that if α is false, then everything will be believed with respect to α. The second version overcomes this problem: Bα 2 ϕ ≡ K(α → ϕ) ∧ (K¬α → Kϕ); now ϕ is only believed if it is known that ϕ follows from assumption α, and ϕ must be known if assumption α is known to be false. Finally, Bα 3 ϕ ≡ K(α → ϕ) ∧ ¬K¬α: if the assumption α is known to be false, nothing should be believed with respect to α. The strength of these different notions is given as follows: Bα 3 ϕ implies Bα 2 ϕ, and Bα 2 ϕ implies Bα 1 ϕ. In this approach, belief is strongly connected to knowledge in the sense that belief is knowledge with respect to a given assumption. Friedman and Halpern: Plausibility Spaces The work of Friedman and Halpern [7] extends the concepts of knowledge and belief with an explicit notion of plausibility; i.e., some worlds are more plausible for an agent than others. To implement this idea, Kripke models are extended with function P which assigns a plausibility space P(q, a) = (Ω(q,a), (q,a)) to every state, or more generally every possible world q, and agent a. The plausibility space 4 Unlike in most approaches, K is interpreted over all worlds and not only over the indistinguishable worlds. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 585 is just a partially ordered subset of states/worlds; that is, Ω(q, a) ⊆ Q, and (q,a)⊆ Q ×Q is a reflexive and transitive relation. Let S, T ⊆ Ω(q,a) be finite subsets of states; now, T is defined to be plausible given S with respect to P(q, a), denoted by S →P (q,a) T, iff all minimal points/states in S (with respect to (q,a)) are also in T.5 Friedman and Halperns view to modal plausibility is closely related to probability and, more generally, plausibility measures. Logics of plausibility can be seen as a qualitative description of agents preferences/knowledge; logics of probability [6, 15], on the other hand, offer a quantitative description. The logic from [7] is defined by the following grammar: ϕ ::= p | ϕ∧ϕ | ¬ϕ | Kaϕ | ϕ →a ϕ, where the semantics of all operators except →a is given as usual, and formulae ϕ →a ψ have the meaning that ψ is true in the most plausible worlds in which ϕ holds. Formally, the semantics for →a is given as: M, q |= ϕ →a ψ iff Sϕ P (q,a) →P(q,a) Sψ P (q,a), where Sϕ (q,a) = {q ∈ Ω(q,a) | M, q |= ϕ} are the states in Ω(q,a) that satisfy ϕ. The idea of defining beliefs is given by the assumption that an agent believes in something if he knows that it is true in the most plausible worlds of Ω(q,a); formally, this can be stated as Baϕ ≡ Ka( →a ϕ). Friedman and Halpern have shown that the KD45 axioms are valid for operator Ba if plausibility spaces satisfy consistency (for all states q ∈ Q it holds that Ω(q,a) ⊆ { q ∈ Q | q ∼a q }) and normality (for all states q ∈ Q it holds that Ω(q,a) = ∅).6 A temporal extension of the language (mentioned briefly in [7], and discussed in more detail in [8]) uses the interpreted systems approach [10, 5]. A system R is given by runs, where a run r : N → Q is a function from time moments (modeled by N) to global states, and a time point (r, i) is given by a time point i ∈ N and a run r. A global state is a combination of local states, one per agent. An interpreted system M = (R, π) is given by a system R and a valuation of propositions π. Epistemic relations are defined over time points, i.e., (r , m ) ∼a (r, m) iff agent as local states ra(m ) and ra(m) of (r , m ) and (r, m) are equal. Formulae are interpreted in a straightforward way with respect to interpreted systems, e.g. M, r, m |= Kaϕ iff M, r , m |= ϕ for all (r , m ) ∼a (r, m). Now, these are time points that play the role of possible worlds; consequently, plausibility spaces P(r,m,a) are assigned to each point (r, m) and agent a. Su et al.: KBC Logic Su et al. [20] have developed a multi-modal, computationally grounded logic with modalities K, B, and C (knowledge, belief, and certainty). The computational model consists of (global) states q = (qvis , qinv , qper , Qpls ) where the environment is divided into a visible (qvis ) and an invisible part (qinv ), and qper captures the agents perception of the visible part of the environment. External sources may provide the agent with information about the invisible part of a state, which results in a set of states Qpls that are plausible for the agent. Given a global state q, we additionally define V is(q) = qvis , Inv(q) = qinv , Per(q) = qper , and Pls(q) = Qpls . The 5 When there are infinite chains . . . q3 q2 a q1, the definition is much more sophisticated. An interested reader is referred to [7] for more details. 6 Note that this normality is essentially seriality of states wrt plausibility spaces. semantics is given by an extension of interpreted systems [10, 5], here, it is called interpreted KBC systems. KBC formulae are defined as ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Kϕ | Bϕ | Cϕ. The epistemic relation ∼vis is captured in the following way: (r, i) ∼vis (r , i ) iff V is(r(i)) = V is(r (i )). The semantic clauses for belief and certainty are given below. M, r, i |= Bϕ iff M, r , i |= ϕ for all (r , i ) with V is(r (i )) = Per(r(i)) and Inv(r (i )) ∈ Pls(r(i)) M, r, i |= Cϕ iff M, r , i |= ϕ for all (r (i )) with V is(r (i )) = Per(r(i)) Thus, an agent believes ϕ if, and only if, ϕ is true in all states which look like what he sees now and seem plausible in the current state. Certainty is stronger: if an agent is certain about ϕ, the formula must hold in all states with a visible part equal to the current perception, regardless of whether the invisible part is plausible or not. The logic does not include temporal formulae, although it might be extended with temporal operators, as time is already present in KBC models. What Are the Differences to Our Logic? In our approach, plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property, i.e., it is a property of temporal paths rather than states. In the object language, this is reflected by the fact that plausibility assumptions are specified through path formulae. In contrast, the approach of [18] and [20] is static: not only the logics do not include operators for talking about time and/or change, but these are states that are assumed plausible or not in their semantics. The differences to [7, 8] are more subtle. Firstly, the framework of Friedman and Halpern is static in the sense that plausibility is taken as a property of (abstract) possible worlds. This formulation is flexible enough to allow for incorporating time; still, in our approach, time is inherent to plausibility rather than incidental. Secondly, our framework is more computationally oriented. The implementation of temporal plausibility in [7, 8] is based on the interpreted systems approach with time points (r, m) being subject to plausibility. As runs are included in time points, they can also be defined plausible or implausible.7 However, it also means that time points serve the role of possible worlds in the basic formulation, which yields Kripke structures with uncountable possible world spaces in all but the most trivial cases. Thirdly, [7, 8] build on linear time: a run (more precisely, a time moment (r, m)) is fixed when a formula is interpreted. In contrast, we use branching time with explicit quantification over temporal paths.8 We believe that branching time is more suitable for non-deterministic domains (cf. e.g. [4]), of which multi-agent systems are a prime example. Note that branching time makes our notion of belief different from Friedman and Halperns. Most notably, property Kϕ → Bϕ is valid in their approach, but not in ours: an agent may 7 Friedman and Halpern even briefly mention how plausibility of runs can be embedded in their framework. 8 To be more precise, time in [7] does implicitly branch at epistemic states. This is because (r, m) ∼a (r , m ) iff as local state corresponding to both time points is the same (ra(m) = ra(m )). In consequence, the semantics of Kaϕ can be read as for every run, and every moment on this run that yields the same local state as now, ϕ holds. 586 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) know that some course of events is in principle possible, without believing that it can really become the case (see Section 4.2). As Proposition 13 suggests, such a subtle distinction between knowledge and beliefs is possible in our approach because branching time logics allow for existential quantification over runs. Fourthly, while Friedman and Halperns models are very flexible, they also enable system descriptions that may seem counterintuitive. Suppose that (r, m) is plausible in itself (formally: (r, m) is minimal wrt (r,m,a)), but (r, m + 1) is not plausible in (r, m + 1). This means that following the plausible path makes it implausible (cf. Remark 1), which is even stranger in the case of linear time. Combining the argument with computational aspects, we suggest that our approach can be more natural and straightforward for many applications. Last but not least, our logic provides a mechanism for specifying (and updating) sets of plausible paths in the object language. Thus, plausibility sets can be specified in a succinct way, which is another feature that makes our framework computation-friendly. The model checking results from Section 5 are especially encouraging in this light. 4. PLAUSIBILITY, KNOWLEDGE, AND BELIEFS IN CTLKP In this section we study some relevant properties of plausibility, knowledge, and beliefs; in particular, axioms KDT45 are examined. But first, we identify two important subclasses of models with plausibility. A CTLKP model is plausibly serial (or p-serial) for agent a if every state of the system is part of a plausible path according to a, i.e. on(Υa) = Q. As we will see further, a weaker requirement is sometimes sufficient. We call a model weakly p-serial if every state has at least one indistinguishable counterpart which lies on a plausible path, i.e. for each q ∈ Q there is a q ∈ Q such that q ∼a q and q ∈ on(Υa). Obviously, p-seriality implies weak p-seriality. We get the following characterization of both model classes. Proposition 4. M is plausibly serial for agent a iff formula Pl aE f is valid in M. M is weakly p-serial for agent a iff ¬KaPl aA f⊥ is valid in M. 4.1 Axiomatic Properties Theorem 5. Axioms K, D, 4, and 5 for knowledge are strongly valid, and axiom T is valid. That is, modalities Ka form system S5 in the sense of normal validity, and KD45 in the sense of strong validity. We do not include proofs here due to lack of space. The interested reader is referred to [2], where detailed proofs are given. Proposition 6. Axioms K, 4, and 5 for beliefs are strongly valid. That is, we have: |≡ (Baϕ ∧ Ba(ϕ → ψ)) → Baψ, |≡ (Baϕ → BaBaϕ), and |≡ (¬Baϕ → Ba¬Baϕ). The next proposition concerns the consistency axiom D: Baϕ → ¬Ba¬ϕ. It is easy to see that the axiom is not valid in general: as we have no restrictions on plausibility sets Υa, it may be as well that Υa = ∅. In that case we have Baϕ ∧ Ba¬ϕ for all formulae ϕ, because the set of states to be considered becomes empty. However, it turns out that D is valid for a very natural class of models. Proposition 7. Axiom D for beliefs is not valid in the class of all CTLKP models. However, it is strongly valid in the class of weak p-serial models (and therefore also in the class of p-serial models). Moreover, as one may expect, beliefs do not have to be always true. Proposition 8. Axiom T for beliefs is not valid; i.e., |= (Baϕ → ϕ). The axiom is not even valid in the class of p-serial models. Theorem 9. Belief modalities Ba form system K45 in the class of all models, and KD45 in the class of weakly plausibly serial models (in the sense of both normal and strong validity). Axiom T is not even valid for p-serial models. 4.2 Plausibility, Knowledge, and Beliefs First, we investigate the relationship between knowledge and plausibility/physicality operators. Then, we look at the interaction between knowledge and beliefs. Proposition 10. Let ϕ be a CTLKP formula, and M be a CTLKP model. We have the following strong validities: (i) |≡ Pl aKaϕ ↔ Kaϕ (ii) |≡ Ph Kaϕ ↔ KaPh ϕ and |≡ KaPh ϕ ↔ Kaϕ We now want to examine the relationship between knowledge and belief. For instance, if agent a believes in something, he knows that he believes it. Or, if he knows a fact, he also believes that he knows it. On the other hand, for instance, an agent does not necessarily believe in all the things he knows. For example, we may know that an invasion from another galaxy is in principle possible (KaE♦ invasion), but if we do not take this possibility as plausible (¬Pl aE♦ invasion), then we reject the corresponding belief in consequence (¬BaE♦ invasion). Note that this property reflects the strong connection between belief and plausibility in our framework. Proposition 11. The following formulae are strongly valid: (i) Baϕ → KaBaϕ, (ii) KaBaϕ → Baϕ, (iii) Kaϕ → BaKaϕ. The following formulae are not valid: (iv) Baϕ → BaKaϕ, (v) Kaϕ → Baϕ The last invalidity is especially important: it is not the case that knowing something implies believing in it. This emphasizes that we study a specific concept of beliefs here. Note that its specific is not due to the plausibility-based definition of beliefs. The reason lies rather in the fact that we investigate knowledge, beliefs and plausibility in a temporal framework, as Proposition 12 shows. Proposition 12. Let ϕ be a CTLKP formula that does not include any temporal operators. Then Kaϕ → Baϕ is strongly valid, and in the class of p-serial models we have even that |≡ Kaϕ ↔ Baϕ. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 587 Moreover, it is important that we use branching time with explicit quantification over paths; this observation is formalized in Proposition 13. Definition 1. We define the universal sublanguage of CTLK in a way similar to [21]: ϕu ::= p | ¬p | ϕu ∧ ϕu | ϕu ∨ ϕu | Aγu | Kaϕu, γu ::= fϕu | 2 ϕu | ϕuU ϕu. We call such ϕu universal formulae, and γu universal path formulae. Proposition 13. Let ϕu be a universal CTLK formula. Then |≡ Kaϕu → Baϕu. The following two theorems characterize the relationship between knowledge and beliefs: first for the class of p-serial models, and then, finally, for all models. Theorem 14. The following formulae are strongly valid in the class of plausibly serial CTLKP models: (i) Baϕ ↔ KaPl aϕ, (ii) Kaϕ ↔ BaPh ϕ. Theorem 15. Formula Baϕ ↔ KaPl a(E f → ϕ) is strongly valid. Note that this characterization has a strong commonsense reading: believing in ϕ is knowing that ϕ plausibly holds in all plausibly imaginable situations. 4.3 Properties of the Update The first notable property of plausibility update is that it influences only formulae in which plausibility plays a role, i.e. ones in which belief or plausibility modalities occur. Proposition 16. Let ϕ be a CTLKP formula that does not include operators Pl a and Ba, and γ be a CTLKP path formula. Then, we have |≡ ϕ ↔ (set-pla γ)ϕ. What can be said about the result of an update? At first sight, formula (set-pla γ)Pl aAγ seems a natural characterization; however, it is not valid. This is because, by leaving the other (implausible) paths out of scope, we may leave out of |γ| some paths that were needed to satisfy γ (see the example in Section 4.2). We propose two alternative ways out: the first one restricts the language of the update similarly to [21]; the other refers to physical possibilities, in a way analogous to [13]. Proposition 17. The CTLKP formula (set-pla γ)Pl aAγ is not valid. However, we have the following validities: (i) |≡ (set-pla γu)Pl aAγu, where γu is a universal CTLK path formula from Definition 1. (ii) If ϕ, ϕ1, ϕ2 are arbitrary CTLK formulae, then: |≡ (set-pla fϕ)Pl aA f(Ph ϕ), |≡ (set-pla 2 ϕ)Pl aA2 (Ph ϕ), and |≡ (set-pla ϕ1U ϕ2)Pl aA(Ph ϕ1)U (Ph ϕ2). 5. VERIFICATION OF PLAUSIBILITY, TIME AND BELIEFS In this section we report preliminary results on model checking CTLKP formulae. Clearly, verifying CTLKP properties directly against models with plausibility does not make much sense, since these models are inherently infinite; what we need is a finite representation of plausibility sets. One such representation has been discussed in Section 3.3: plausibility sets can be defined by path formulae and the update operator (set-pla γ). We follow this idea here, studying the complexity of model checking CTLKP formulae against CTLK models (which can be seen as a compact representation of CTLKP models in which all the paths are assumed plausible), with the underlying idea that plausibility sets, when needed, must be defined explicitly in the object language. Below we sketch an algorithm that model-checks CTLKP formulae in time linear wrt the size of the model and the length of the formula. This means that we have extended CTLK to a more expressive language with no computational price to pay. First of all, we get rid of the belief operators (due to Theorem 15), replacing every occurrence of Baϕ with KaPl a(E f → ϕ). Now, let −→γ = γ1, ..., γk be a vector of vanilla path formulae (one per agent), with the initial vector −→γ0 = , ..., , and −→γ [γ /a] denoting vector −→γ , in which −→γ [a] is replaced with γ . Additionally, we define −→γ [0] = . We translate the resulting CTLKP formulae to ones without plausibility via function tr(ϕ) = tr−→γ0,0(ϕ), defined as follows: tr−→γ ,i(p) = p, tr−→γ ,i(ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2) = tr−→γ ,i(ϕ1) ∧ tr−→γ ,i(ϕ2), tr−→γ ,i(¬ϕ) = ¬tr−→γ ,i(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i(Kaϕ) = Ka tr−→γ ,0(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i(Pla ϕ) = tr−→γ ,a(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i((set-pla γ )ϕ) = tr−→γ [γ /a],i(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i(Ph ϕ) = tr−→γ ,0(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i( fϕ) = ftr−→γ ,i(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i(2 ϕ) = 2 tr−→γ ,i(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i(ϕ1U ϕ2) = tr−→γ ,i(ϕ1)U tr−→γ ,i(ϕ2), tr−→γ ,i(Eγ ) = E(−→γ [i] ∧ tr−→γ ,i(γ )). Note that the resulting sentences belong to the logic of CTLK+, that is CTL+ (where each path quantifier can be followed by a Boolean combination of vanilla path formulae)9 with epistemic modalities. The following proposition justifies the translation. Proposition 18. For any CTLKP formula ϕ without Ba, we have that M, q |=CTLKP ϕ iff M, q |=CTLK+ tr(ϕ). In general, model checking CTL+ (and also CTLK+) is ΔP 2 -complete. However, in our case, the Boolean combinations of path subformulae are always conjunctions of at most two non-negated elements, which allows us to propose the following model checking algorithm. First, subformulae are evaluated recursively: for every subformula ψ of ϕ, the set of states in M that satisfy ψ is computed and labeled with a new proposition pψ. Now, it is enough to define checking M, q |= ϕ for ϕ in which all (state) subformulae are propositions, with the following cases: Case M, q |= E(2 p ∧ γ): If M, q |= p, then return no. Otherwise, remove from M all the states that do not satisfy p (yielding a sparser model M ), and check the CTL formula Eγ in M , q with any CTL model-checker. Case M, q |= E( fp ∧ γ): Create M by adding a copy q of state q, in which only the transitions to states satisfying p are kept (i.e., M, q |= r iff M, q |= r; and q Rq iff qRq and M, q |= p). Then, check Eγ in M , q . 9 For the semantics of CTL+, and discussion of model checking complexity, cf. [17]. 588 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Case M, q |= E(p1U p2 ∧ p3U p4): Note that this is equivalent to checking E(p1 ∧ p3)U (p2 ∧ Ep3U p4) ∨ E(p1 ∧ p3)U (p4 ∧ Ep1U p2), which is a CTL formula. Other cases: The above cases cover all possible formulas that begin with a path quantifier. For other cases, standard CTLK model checking can be used. Theorem 19. Model checking CTLKP against CTLK models is PTIME-complete, and can be done in time O(ml), where m is the number of transitions in the model, and l is the length of the formula to be checked. That is, the complexity is no worse than for CTLK itself. 6. CONCLUSIONS In this paper a notion of plausible behavior is considered, with the underlying idea that implausible options should be usually ignored in practical reasoning about possible future courses of action. We add the new notion of plausibility to the logic of CTLK [19], and obtain a language which enables reasoning about what can (or must) plausibly happen. As a technical device to define the semantics of the resulting logic, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P that allows to propagate the current set of plausible paths into subformulae. Furthermore, we propose a non-standard notion of beliefs, defined in terms of indistinguishability and plausibility. We also propose how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility update operator (in a way similar to [13]). We use this new framework to investigate some important properties of plausibility, knowledge, beliefs, and updates. In particular, we show that knowledge is an S5 modality, and that beliefs satisfy axioms K45 in general, and KD45 for the class of plausibly serial models. We also prove that believing in ϕ is knowing that ϕ plausibly holds in all plausibly possible situations. That is, the relationship between knowledge and beliefs is very natural and reflects the initial intuition precisely. Moreover, the model checking results from Section 5 show that verification for CTLKP is no more complex than for CTL and CTLK. We would like to stress that we do not see this contribution as a mere technical exercise in formal logic. Human agents use a similar concept of plausibility and practical beliefs in their everyday reasoning in order to reduce the search space and make the reasoning feasible. As a consequence, we suggest that the framework we propose may prove suitable for modeling, design, and analysis resource-bounded agents in general. We would like to thank Juergen Dix for fruitful discussions, useful comments and improvements. 7. REFERENCES [1] R. Alur, T. A. Henzinger, and O. Kupferman. Alternating-time Temporal Logic.

    "original_translation": "Agentes, creencias y comportamiento plausible en un entorno temporal de toros y Wojciech Jamroga Departamento de Informática, Universidad de Tecnología Clausthal, Alemania {Bulling, Wjamroga}@in.tu-clausthal.de lógica abstracta de conocimiento y creencias son a menudo demasiado estáticas yInflexible para ser utilizado en problemas del mundo real. En particular, generalmente no ofrecen ningún concepto para expresar que es más probable que ocurra algún curso de eventos que otro. Abordamos este problema y ampliamos CTLK (lógica del árbol de cálculo con conocimiento) con una noción de plausibilidad, que permite un razonamiento práctico y contrafactual. La nueva lógica CTLKP (CTLK con plausibilidad) incluye también una noción particular de creencia. Se agrega un operador de actualización de plausibilidad a esta lógica para cambiar dinámicamente los supuestos de plausibilidad. Además, examinamos algunas propiedades importantes de estos conceptos. En particular, mostramos que, para una clase natural de modelos, la creencia es una modalidad KD45. También mostramos que la verificación de modelos CTLKP es completa y se puede hacer en tiempo lineal con respecto al tamaño de los modelos y fórmulas. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos I.2.11 [Inteligencia artificial]: Sistemas distribuidos de inteligencia artificial-matiagente;I.2.4 [Inteligencia artificial]: Formalismos de representación del conocimiento y métodos lógica modal Términos generales Teoría 1. Las nociones de introducción como el tiempo, el conocimiento y las creencias son muy importantes para analizar el comportamiento de los agentes y los sistemas de múltiples agentes. En este artículo, ampliamos lógicas modales de tiempo y conocimiento con un concepto de comportamiento plausible: esta noción se agrega al lenguaje de CTLK [19], que es una combinación directa de la lógica temporal de tiempo ramificada CTL [4, 3]y lógica epistémica estándar [9, 5]. En nuestro enfoque, la plausibilidad puede verse como una propiedad temporal de los comportamientos. Es decir, algunos comportamientos del sistema pueden asumirse plausibles y otros inverosímiles, con la idea subyacente de que este último tal vez debería ignorarse en el razonamiento práctico sobre posibles cursos de acción futuros. Además, los comportamientos pueden entenderse formalmente como caminos temporales en la estructura de Kripke que modela un sistema multiagente. Como consecuencia, obtenemos un idioma para razonar sobre lo que puede (o debe) suceder plausiblemente. Proponemos una noción particular de creencias (inspiradas en [20, 7]), definida en términos de relaciones epistémicas y plausibilidad. La intuición principal es que las creencias son hechos que un agente sabría si asumió que solo podrían suceder cosas plausibles. Creemos que los humanos usan tal concepto de plausibilidad y creencias prácticas con bastante frecuencia en su razonamiento cotidiano. Restringir el razonamiento de los que se encuentran a las posibilidades plausibles es esencial para que el razonamiento sea factible, ya que el espacio de todas las posibilidades es extremadamente grande en la vida real. Investigamos algunas propiedades importantes de plausibilidad, conocimiento y creencia en este nuevo marco. En particular, mostramos que el conocimiento es una modalidad S5, y que las creencias satisfacen los axiomas K45 en general, y KD45 para la clase de modelos seriales plausiblemente. Finalmente, mostramos que la relación entre el conocimiento y la creencia para los modelos en serie plausiblemente es natural y refleja bien la intuición inicial. También mostramos cómo se pueden especificar los supuestos de plausibilidad en el lenguaje de objetos a través de un operador de actualización de plausibilidad, y estudiamos propiedades de tales actualizaciones. Finalmente, mostramos que la verificación del modelo de la nueva lógica no es más compleja que la verificación del modelo CTL y CTLK. Nuestro objetivo final es crear una lógica que permita el estudio de estrategias, tiempo, conocimiento y comportamiento plausible/racional bajo información perfecta e imperfecta. Como combinar todas estas dimensiones es altamente no trivial (cf. [12, 14]), parece razonable dividir esta tarea. Si bien este artículo trata sobre el conocimiento, la plausibilidad y la creencia, el documento complementario [11] propone un marco general para los sistemas de múltiples agentes que consideran criterios de racionalidad teóricos del juego como el equilibrio Nash, la optimización de Pareto, etc. El último enfoque se basa en la lógica más poderosa ATL [1]. El papel está estructurado de la siguiente manera. En primer lugar, presentamos brevemente la lógica del tiempo de ramificación con conocimiento, CTLK. En la Sección 3 presentamos nuestro enfoque de plausibilidad y definimos formalmente CTLK con plausibilidad. También mostramos cómo 582 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Las fórmulas temporales Ifaamas se pueden usar para describir rutas plausibles, y comparamos nuestra lógica con el trabajo relacionado existente. En la Sección 4, se exploran las propiedades del conocimiento, la creencia y la plausibilidad. Finalmente, presentamos resultados de complejidad de verificación para CTLKP en la Sección 5. 2. El tiempo y el conocimiento de la ramificación en este artículo desarrollamos un marco para las creencias de los agentes sobre cómo el mundo puede (o debe) evolucionar. Por lo tanto, necesitamos una noción de tiempo y cambio, más una noción de lo que se supone que los agentes deben saber en situaciones particulares. CTLK [19] es una combinación directa de la lógica del árbol de cálculo CTL [4, 3] y la lógica epistémica estándar [9, 5]. CTL incluye operadores de propiedades temporales de los sistemas: es decir, el cuantificador de ruta E (hay una ruta), junto con operadores temporales: F (en el siguiente estado), 2 (siempre de ahora en adelante) y U (hasta) .1 Cada ocurrenciade un operador temporal está precedido por exactamente un cuantificador de ruta en CTL (esta variante del lenguaje a veces se llama CTL de vainilla). La lógica epistémica utiliza operadores para representar el conocimiento de los agentes: Kaϕ se lee como agente A sabe que ϕ. Sea π un conjunto de proposiciones atómicas con un elemento típico p, y agt = {1, ..., k} Sea un conjunto de agentes con un elemento típico a. El lenguaje de CTLK consiste en fórmulas ϕ, dada la siguiente: ϕ :: = P |¬ϕ |ϕ ∧ ϕ |Eγ |Kaϕ γ :: = fϕ |2 ϕ |ϕu ϕ. A veces nos referiremos a las fórmulas ϕ como fórmulas de estado (de vainilla) y fórmulas γ como fórmulas de ruta (de vainilla). La semántica de CTLK se basa en los modelos Kripke M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, π, que incluyen un conjunto no vacío de estados Q, una relación de transición de estado R ⊆ Q × Q, Relaciones de indistinguibilidad epistémica ∼A⊆ Q × Q (uno por agente), y una valoración de las proposiciones π: π → P (Q). Suponemos que la relación R es en serie y que todas las ∼A son relaciones de equivalencia. Una ruta λ en M se refiere a un posible comportamiento (o cálculo) del sistema M, y puede representarse como una secuencia infinita de estados que siguen la relación R, es decir, una secuencia Q0Q1Q2 ... como Qirqi+1 para cada i= 0, 1, 2, ... denotamos el estado ésimo en λ por λ [i]. El conjunto de todas las rutas en M se denota por λm (si el modelo está claro en el contexto, M se omitirá). Un Q-Path es una ruta que comienza desde Q, es decir, λ [0] = Q. Un Q-Sumath es una secuencia de estados, que comienza desde Q, que es una subputa de alguna ruta en el modelo, es decir, una secuencia Q0Q1 ... tal que Q = Q0 y hay Q0, ..., Qi tal que Q0... Qi Q0Q1 ... ∈ λm.2 La semántica de CTLK se define de la siguiente manera: M, Q | = P iff q ∈ π (p);M, q | = ¬ϕ iff m, q | = ϕ;M, q | = ϕ ∧ ψ iff m, q | = ϕ y m, q | = ψ;M, q | = e fϕ iff hay una ruta q λ tal que m, λ [1] | = ϕ;M, q | = e2 ϕ iff hay una ruta q λ tal que m, λ [i] | = ϕ por cada i ≥ 0;1 operadores adicionales A (para cada ruta) y ♦ (en algún momento en el futuro) se definen de la manera habitual.2 Para los modelos CTLK, λ es un Q-supath IFF es un Q-Path. No siempre será así cuando se introduzcan caminos plausibles. M, q | = eϕu ψ iff hay un Q-Path λ e I ≥ 0 tal que m, λ [i] | = ψ, y m, λ [j] | = ϕ para cada 0 ≤ j <i;M, q | = kaϕ iff m, q | = ϕ para cada q tal que q ∼A q.3. Extender el tiempo y el conocimiento con plausibilidad y creencias en esta sección discutimos el concepto central de este documento, es decir, el concepto de plausibilidad. Primero, describimos la idea informalmente. Luego, extendemos CTLK con la noción de plausibilidad agregando operadores de ruta plausible PL A y PH del operador de ruta física a la lógica. La fórmula PL aϕ tiene el significado previsto: según el agente A, es plausible que ϕ se mantenga;La fórmula PH ϕ lee como: ϕ se mantiene en todos los escenarios físicamente posibles (es decir, incluso en los inverosímiles). El operador de ruta plausible restringe las declaraciones solo a aquellas rutas que se definen para ser sensatas, mientras que el operador de ruta física genera declaraciones sobre todas las rutas que teóricamente pueden ocurrir. Además, definimos las creencias además de la plausibilidad y el conocimiento, como los hechos que un agente sabría si asumió que solo podrían suceder cosas plausibles. Finalmente, discutimos el trabajo relacionado [7, 8, 20, 18, 16], y lo comparamos con nuestro enfoque.3.1 El concepto de plausibilidad es bien sabido cómo el conocimiento (o creencias) puede modelarse con estructuras de Kripke. Sin embargo, no es tan obvio cómo podemos capturar el conocimiento y las creencias de una manera sensata en un marco. Claramente, debería haber una conexión entre estas dos nociones. Nuestro enfoque es utilizar la noción de plausibilidad para este propósito. La plausibilidad puede servir como un concepto primitivo que ayuda a definir la semántica de las creencias, de manera similar a la indistinguibilidad de los estados (representados por la relación ∼A) es el concepto semántico que subyace al conocimiento. En este sentido, nuestro trabajo sigue [7, 20]: esencialmente, las creencias son lo que un agente sabría si solo tenía en cuenta las opciones plausibles. En nuestro enfoque, sin embargo, la plausibilidad se ve explícitamente como una propiedad temporal. Es decir, no consideramos que los estados (o los mundos posibles) sean más plausibles que otros, sino que definimos que algunos comportamientos sean plausibles, y otros inverosímiles. Además, los comportamientos pueden entenderse formalmente como caminos temporales en la estructura de Kripke que modela un sistema de agentes múltiples. Puede surgir una noción real de plausibilidad (es decir, un conjunto particular de caminos plausibles) de muchas maneras diferentes. Puede resultar de observaciones y aprendizaje;Un agente puede aprender de sus observaciones y ver patrones específicos de eventos como plausibles (muchas personas usan zapatos negros si usan un traje). El intercambio de conocimiento es otra posibilidad (por ejemplo, un agente A puede decirle al Agente B que el jugador C siempre se ve gastando cuando está sonriendo). La teoría del juego, con sus criterios de racionalidad (estrategias no administradas, maxmin, equilibrio Nash, etc.) es otra fuente viable de supuestos de plausibilidad. Por último, pero no menos importante, el conocimiento popular puede usarse para establecer clasificaciones de comportamiento relacionadas con la plausibilidad (los jugadores normalmente quieren ganar un juego, la gente quiere vivir). En cualquier caso, restringir el razonamiento a las posibilidades plausibles puede ser esencial si queremos que el razonamiento sea factible, ya que el espacio de todas las posibilidades (las llamamos posibilidades físicas en el resto del documento) es extremadamente grande en la vida real. Por supuesto, esto no excluye un análisis más extenso en casos especiales, p.Cuando nuestras suposiciones de plausibilidad ya no parecen precisas, o cuando el costo del sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 583 Los supuestos inexactos pueden ser demasiado altos (como en el caso de las decisiones comerciales de alto presupuesto). Pero incluso en estos casos, generalmente no nos deshacemos de los supuestos de plausibilidad por completo: solo los revisamos para que los hagan más cautelosos.3 Para formalizar esta idea, extendemos modelos de CTLK con conjuntos de rutas plausibles y agregamos operadores de plausibilidad por plationOperador de rutas físicas PH y operadores de creencias BA al lenguaje de CTLK. Ahora, es posible hacer declaraciones que se refieran solo a rutas plausibles, así como declaraciones que consideran todas las rutas que pueden ocurrir en el sistema.3.2 CTLK Con plausibilidad En esta sección, ampliamos la lógica de CTLK con plausibilidad;Llamamos a la lógica resultante CTLKP. Formalmente, el lenguaje de CTLKP se define como: ϕ :: = P |¬ϕ |ϕ ∧ ϕ |Eγ |PL aϕ |PH ϕ |Kaϕ |Baϕ γ :: = fϕ |2 ϕ |ϕu ϕ. Por ejemplo, podemos afirmar que es plausible suponer que una tienda está cerrada después del horario de apertura, aunque el gerente puede estar físicamente capaz de abrirlo en cualquier momento: PL aa2 (tarde → ¬Pen) ∧ ph e ♦ (tardío ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧abierto). La semántica de CTLKP extiende la de CTLK de la siguiente manera. En primer lugar, aumentamos los modelos con conjuntos de rutas plausibles. Un modelo con plausibilidad se da como M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼K, υ1, ..., υK, π, donde Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼K, π esUn modelo CTLK, y υA ⊆ λm es el conjunto de rutas en M que son plausibles según el agente a. Si queremos dejar en claro que υA está tomado del Modelo M, escribiremos υm a. Parece que vale la pena enfatizar que esta noción de plausibilidad es subjetiva y holística. Es subjetivo porque υA representa al agente como una visión subjetiva de lo que es plausible, y de hecho, diferentes agentes pueden tener diferentes ideas sobre plausibilidad (es decir, υA puede diferir de υb). Es holístico porque υA representa al agente como idea del comportamiento plausible de todo el sistema (incluido el comportamiento de otros agentes). Observación 1. En nuestros modelos, la plausibilidad también es global, es decir, los conjuntos de plausibilidad no dependen del estado del sistema. Los sistemas de investigación, en los que se relativan la plausibilidad con respecto a los estados (como en [7]), podrían ser una vía interesante de trabajo futuro. Sin embargo, este enfoque, aunque obviamente más flexible, permite descripciones potencialmente contraintuitivas del sistema. Por ejemplo, podría ser el caso de que la ruta λ es plausible en Q = λ [0], pero el conjunto de rutas plausibles en Q = λ [1] está vacío. Es decir, siguiendo la ruta plausible λ estamos obligados a llegar a una situación inverosímil. Pero entonces, ¿tiene sentido considerar λ como plausible? En segundo lugar, utilizamos una relación de satisfacción no estándar | = P, que llamamos satisfacción plausible. Sea m un CTLKP 3, es decir, cuando planea abrir una planta industrial en el Reino Unido, probablemente consideraremos la posibilidad de que nuestro contratista principal le quite la vida, pero aún no tendremos en cuenta las posibilidades de: una invasión de ovnis, Inglaterra siendo destruida por un meteorito, Fidel Castro se convirtió en el primer ministro británico, etc. Tenga en cuenta que esto es fundamentalmente diferente del uso de un modelo probabilístico en el que se asignan a todos estos escenarios poco probables que se asignan probabilidades muy bajas: en ese caso, también tienen una influencia muy pequeña en nuestra decisión final, pero debemos procesar todo el espacio de posibilidades físicas paraevaluar las opciones.El modelo y P ⊆ λm ser un subconjunto arbitrario de rutas en M (no necesariamente ninguna υm a).| = P restringe la evaluación de fórmulas temporales a las rutas dadas solo en P. La relación de satisfacción absoluta | = se define como | = λm. Sea en (p) el conjunto de todos los estados que se encuentran en al menos una ruta en p, es decir, en (p) = {q ∈ Q |∃λ ∈ P∃i (λ [i] = q)}. Ahora, la semántica de CTLKP se puede administrar a través de las siguientes cláusulas: m, q | = P p iff q ∈ π (p);M, q | = P ¬ϕ iff m, q | = P ϕ;M, q | = P ϕ ∧ ψ iff m, q | = p ϕ y m, q | = p ψ;M, q | = p e fϕ iff hay una supath q λ ∈ P tal que m, λ [1] | = P ϕ;M, q | = p e2 ϕ iff hay un supath q λ ∈ P tal que m, λ [i] | = p ϕ por cada i ≥ 0;M, q | = p eϕu ψ iff hay un Q-supath λ ∈ P e i ≥ 0 tal que m, λ [i] | = p ψ y m, λ [j] | = p ϕ por cada 0 ≤J <i;M, q | = p pl aϕ iff m, q | = υA ϕ;M, q | = p ph ϕ iff m, q | = ϕ;M, q | = P kaϕ iff m, q | = ϕ para cada q tal que q ∼A q;M, q | = P Baϕ iff para todos Q ∈ en (υA) con Q ∼A Q, tenemos que m, q | = υA ϕ. Una de las principales razones para usar el concepto de plausibilidad es que queremos definir las creencias de los agentes de conceptos más primitivos, en nuestro caso, estos son la plausibilidad e indistinguibilidad, de una manera análoga a [20, 7]. Si un agente lo sabe ϕ, debe estar seguro al respecto. Sin embargo, las creencias de un agente no son necesariamente de hechos confiables. Aún así, deberían tener sentido para el agente;Si él cree que ϕ, entonces la fórmula debería al menos mantener todos los futuros que prevé como plausible. Por lo tanto, las creencias de un agente pueden verse como cosas conocidas si no tiene en cuenta todas las posibilidades no placatadas. Decimos que ϕ es m-true (m | = ϕ) si m, q | = ϕ para todos q ∈ Qm.ϕ es válido (| = ϕ) si m | = ϕ para todos los modelos M. ϕ es m de manera más verdadera (m | ≡ ϕ) si m, q | = p ϕ para todos q ∈ Qm y todos p ⊆ λm.ϕ es fuertemente válido (| ≡ ϕ) si m | ≡ ϕ para todos los modelos M. Proposición 2. La verdad fuerte y la fuerte validez implican la verdad y la validez, respectivamente. El reverso no se mantiene. En última instancia, nos interesaremos la validez normal (no fuerte), ya que la parametrización de la relación de satisfacción con un conjunto P es solo un dispositivo técnico para propagar conjuntos de caminos plausibles en la semántica de fórmulas anidadas. Sin embargo, la importancia de una fuerte validez radica en el hecho de que | ≡ ϕ ↔ ψ hace ϕ y ψ completamente intercambiable, mientras que lo mismo no es cierto para la validez normal. Proposición 3. Deje φ [ϕ/ψ] denota fórmula φ en la que cada aparición de ψ fue reemplazada por ϕ. Además, deje | ≡ ϕ ↔ ψ. Entonces, para todos m, q, p: m, q | = p φ iff m, q | = p φ [ϕ/ψ] (en particular, m, q | = φ iff m, q | = φ [ϕ/ψ]). Tenga en cuenta que | = ϕ ↔ ψ ni siquiera implica que m, q | = φ iff m, q | = φ [ϕ/ψ].584 El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Figura 1: Gues de robots de robots Ejemplo 1 (Robots de adivinanzas). Considere un juego simple con dos agentes A y B, que se muestra en la Figura 1. Primero, A elige un número real r ∈ [0, 1] (sin revelar el número a B);Entonces, B elige un número real r ∈ [0, 1]. Los agentes ganan el juego (y recolectan 1, 000, 000, 000) si ambos eligieron 1, de lo contrario pierden. Formalmente, modelamos el juego con un modelo M CTLKP, en el que el conjunto de estados Q incluye QS para la situación inicial, estados QR, R ∈ [0, 1], para las situaciones después de A ha elegido el número R y los estados finalesQW, QL para la situación ganadora y perdida, respectivamente. La relación de transición es la siguiente: QSRQR y QRRQL para todos r ∈ [0, 1];Q1RQW, QWRQW y QLRQL. Además, π (uno) = {Q1} y π (win) = {qw}. El jugador A tiene información perfecta en el juego (es decir, q ∼A q iff q = q), pero el jugador B no distingue entre los estados QR (es decir, qr ∼b qr para todos r, r ∈ [0, 1]). Obviamente, lo único sensato para ambos agentes es elegir 1 (usando el vocabulario teórico del juego, estas estrategias son fuertemente dominantes para los jugadores respectivos). Por lo tanto, solo hay un curso de eventos plausible si suponemos que nuestros jugadores son racionales y, por lo tanto, υA = υb = {QSQ1QWQW...}. Tenga en cuenta que, en principio, el resultado del juego es incierto: m, qs | = ¬a ♦ win∧¬a2 ¬win. Sin embargo, asumir la racionalidad de los jugadores hace que sea plausible que el juego termine con una victoria: M, QS | = PLA A ♦ WIN ∧ PLB A ♦ Gana, y los agentes creen que este será el caso: M, QS| = BAA ♦ Gana ∧ BBA ♦ Gana. Tenga en cuenta también que, en cualquiera de los estados QR, el Agente B cree que A (siendo racional) ha jugado 1: m, qr | = bbone para todos r ∈ [0, 1].3.3 Definición de rutas plausibles con fórmulas Hasta ahora, hemos asumido que los conjuntos de rutas plausibles se dan de alguna manera en los modelos. En esta sección presentamos un enfoque dinámico donde se puede especificar una noción real de plausibilidad en el lenguaje de objetos. Tenga en cuenta que queremos especificar conjuntos (generalmente infinitos) de rutas infinitas, y necesitamos una representación finita de estas estructuras. Una solución lógica se da mediante el uso de fórmulas de ruta γ. Estas fórmulas describen propiedades de las rutas;Por lo tanto, se puede usar una fórmula específica para caracterizar un conjunto de rutas. Por ejemplo, piense en un país en África donde nunca ha nevado. Entonces, los caminos plausibles pueden definirse como los que nunca nieva, es decir, todos los caminos que satisfacen 2 ¬ Snows. Formalmente, sea γ una fórmula de ruta CTLK. Definimos | γ | m como el conjunto de rutas que satisfacen γ en el modelo M: |fϕ | m = {λ |M, λ [1] | = ϕ} | 2 ϕ | m = {λ |∀i (m, λ [i] | = ϕ)} | ϕ1u ϕ2 | m = {λ |∃i `m, λ [i] | = ϕ2 ∧ ∀j (0 ≤ j <i ⇒ m, λ [j] | = ϕ1) ´}. Además, definimos la actualización del modelo de rutas plausibles de la siguiente manera. Sea M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼K, υ1, ..., υK, π ser un modelo CTLKP, y P ⊆ λm sea un conjunto de rutas. Entonces ma, p = q, r, ∼1, ..., ∼k, υ1, ..., υa - 1, p, υa+1, ..., υk, π denota el modelo M con un conjunto de plausibleLas rutas se restablecen a P. Ahora podemos extender el lenguaje de CTLKP con fórmulas (set-PLA γ) ϕ con la lectura intuitiva: Suponga que γ caracteriza exactamente el conjunto de rutas plausibles, luego ϕ se mantiene y semántica formal a continuación: M, M,Q | = P (Set-PLA γ) ϕ IFF MA, | γ | M, Q | = P ϕ. Observamos que este esquema de actualización es similar al propuesto en [13].3.4 Comparación con el trabajo relacionado Varias nociones modales de plausibilidad ya se discutieron en la literatura existente [7, 8, 20, 18, 16]. En estos documentos, como en el nuestro, la plausibilidad se usa como un concepto semántico primitivo que ayuda a definir creencias sobre el conocimiento de los agentes. Moses y Shoham introdujeron una idea similar en [18]. Su trabajo precedió tanto a [7, 8] como [20] y aunque Moisés y Shoham no mencionan explícitamente el término plausibilidad, parece apropiado resumir su idea primero. Moisés y Shoham: las creencias como conocimiento condicional en [18], las creencias se relativan con respecto a una fórmula α (que puede verse como una suposición de plausibilidad expresada en el lenguaje del objeto). Más precisamente, los mundos que satisfacen α pueden considerarse plausibles. Este concepto se expresa a través de los símbolos Bα I ϕ;El índice I ∈ {1, 2, 3} se usa para distinguir entre tres implementaciones diferentes de creencias. La primera versión viene dada por Bα 1 ϕ ≡ K (α → ϕ) .4 Un inconveniente de esta versión es que si α es falso, entonces todo se creerá con respecto a α. La segunda versión supera este problema: Bα 2 ϕ ≡ K (α → ϕ) ∧ (K¬α → Kϕ);Ahora solo se cree ϕ si se sabe que ϕ se deduce de la suposición α, y se debe saber ϕ si se sabe que la suposición α es falsa. Finalmente, Bα 3 ϕ ≡ K (α → ϕ) ∧ ¬k¬α: si se sabe que la suposición α es falsa, no se debe creer nada con respecto a α. La resistencia de estas nociones diferentes se da de la siguiente manera: Bα 3 ϕ implica Bα 2 ϕ, y Bα 2 ϕ implica Bα 1 ϕ. En este enfoque, la creencia está fuertemente relacionada con el conocimiento en el sentido de que la creencia es el conocimiento con respecto a una suposición dada. Friedman y Halpern: la plausibilidad espacia el trabajo de Friedman y Halpern [7] extiende los conceptos de conocimiento y creencia con una noción explícita de plausibilidad;es decir, algunos mundos son más plausibles para un agente que otros. Para implementar esta idea, los modelos Kripke se extienden con la función P que asigna un espacio de plausibilidad P (Q, A) = (Ω (Q, A), (Q, A)) a cada estado, o más generalmente cada mundo posible Q,y agente a. El espacio de plausibilidad 4 a diferencia de la mayoría de los enfoques, K se interpreta en todos los mundos y no solo en los mundos indistinguibles. El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 585 es solo un subconjunto parcialmente ordenado de estados/mundos;es decir, Ω (Q, A) ⊆ Q, y (Q, A) ⊆ Q × Q es una relación reflexiva y transitiva. Sea s, t ⊆ ω (q, a) subsets de estados finitos;Ahora, T se define como es plausible S se da S con respecto a P (Q, A), denotado por S → P (Q, A) T, IFF Todos los puntos/estados mínimos en S (con respecto a (Q, A))También están en T.5 Friedman y Halperns View de la plausibilidad modal está estrechamente relacionada con la probabilidad y, en general, medidas de plausibilidad. Las lógicas de plausibilidad pueden verse como una descripción cualitativa de las preferencias/conocimiento de los agentes;Las lógicas de probabilidad [6, 15], por otro lado, ofrecen una descripción cuantitativa. La lógica de [7] se define mediante la siguiente gramática: ϕ :: = P |ϕ∧ϕ |¬ϕ |Kaϕ |ϕ → A ϕ, donde la semántica de todos los operadores, excepto → A, se da como de costumbre, y las fórmulas ϕ → A ψ tienen el significado de que ψ es verdadero en los mundos más plausibles en los que ϕ se mantiene. Formalmente, la semántica para → A se da como: M, Q | = ϕ → A ψ Iff Sϕ P (Q, A) → P (Q, A) Sψ P (Q, A), donde Sϕ (Q, A)= {q ∈ ω (q, a) |M, q | = ϕ} son los estados en ω (q, a) que satisfacen ϕ. La idea de definir creencias viene dada por la suposición de que un agente cree en algo si sabe que es cierto en los mundos más plausibles de ω (Q, A);Formalmente, esto se puede establecer como Baϕ ≡ Ka (→ A ϕ). Friedman y Halpern han demostrado que los axiomas KD45 son válidos para el operador BA si los espacios de plausibilidad satisfacen la consistencia (para todos los estados q ∈ Q, sostiene que Ω (Q, a) ⊆ {q ∈ Q | Q ∼A q}) y la normalidad (paraTodos los estados q ∈ Q sostienen que Ω (Q, a) = ∅) .6 Una extensión temporal del lenguaje (mencionado brevemente en [7], y discutido con más detalle en [8]) utiliza el enfoque de sistemas interpretados [10, 5]. Un sistema R viene dado por ejecuciones, donde una ejecución r: n → q es una función de momentos de tiempo (modelado por n) a los estados globales, y un punto de tiempo (r, i) está dado por un punto de tiempo i ∈ N yuna carrera r.Un estado global es una combinación de estados locales, uno por agente. Un sistema interpretado m = (r, π) viene dado por un sistema R y una valoración de las proposiciones π.Las relaciones epistémicas se definen en los puntos de tiempo, es decir, (R, M) ∼A (R, M) IFF Agent como estados locales RA (M) y RA (M) de (R, M) y (R, M) son iguales. Las fórmulas se interpretan de manera directa con respecto a los sistemas interpretados, p. M, r, m | = kaϕ iff m, r, m | = ϕ para todos (r, m) ∼A (r, m). Ahora, estos son puntos de tiempo que juegan el papel de posibles mundos;En consecuencia, los espacios de plausibilidad P (R, M, A) se asignan a cada punto (R, M) y agente a.Su et al.: KBC Logic Su et al.[20] han desarrollado una lógica multimodal, computacionalmente fundamentada con modalidades K, B y C (conocimiento, creencia y certeza). El modelo computacional consta de (global) estados q = (QVIS, Qinv, Qper, QPLS) donde el entorno se divide en una parte visible (QVIS) y una parte invisible (Qinv), y Qper captura la percepción de los agentes de la parte visible deel entorno. Las fuentes externas pueden proporcionar al agente información sobre la parte invisible de un estado, lo que da como resultado un conjunto de QPL de estados que son plausibles para el agente. Dado un estado global Q, también definimos V es (Q) = QVIS, Inv (Q) = Qinv, Per (Q) = Qper y PLS (Q) = QPLS. El 5 cuando hay cadenas infinitas...Q3 Q2 A Q1, la definición es mucho más sofisticada. Se remite a un lector interesado a [7] para obtener más detalles.6 Tenga en cuenta que esta normalidad es esencialmente serialidad de los estados espacios de plausibilidad WRT.La semántica viene dada por una extensión de sistemas interpretados [10, 5], aquí, se llama sistemas KBC interpretados. Las fórmulas KBC se definen como ϕ :: = P |¬ϕ |ϕ ∧ ϕ |Kϕ |Bϕ |Cϕ. La relación epistémica ∼VIS se captura de la siguiente manera: (r, i) ∼vis (r, i) iff v es (r (i)) = v es (r (i)). Las cláusulas semánticas para la creencia y la certeza se dan a continuación. M, r, i | = bϕ iff m, r, i | = ϕ para todos (r, i) con v es (r (i)) = per (r (i)) e inv (r (i)) ∈Pls (r (i)) m, r, i | = cϕ iff m, r, i | = ϕ para todos (r (i)) con v es (r (i)) = per (r (i)) Así, un agente cree ϕ si, y solo si, ϕ es cierto en todos los estados que se parecen a lo que ve ahora y parece plausible en el estado actual. La certeza es más fuerte: si un agente está seguro de ϕ, la fórmula debe mantenerse en todos los estados con una parte visible igual a la percepción actual, independientemente de si la parte invisible es plausible o no. La lógica no incluye fórmulas temporales, aunque podría extenderse con operadores temporales, ya que el tiempo ya está presente en los modelos KBC. ¿Cuáles son las diferencias para nuestra lógica? En nuestro enfoque, la plausibilidad se ve explícitamente como una propiedad temporal, es decir, es una propiedad de las rutas temporales en lugar de los estados. En el lenguaje de objetos, esto se refleja en el hecho de que los supuestos de plausibilidad se especifican a través de fórmulas de ruta. En contraste, el enfoque de [18] y [20] es estático: no solo las lógicas no incluyen operadores para hablar sobre el tiempo y/o el cambio, sino que estos son estados que se suponen plausibles o no en su semántica. Las diferencias a [7, 8] son más sutiles. En primer lugar, el marco de Friedman y Halpern es estático en el sentido de que la plausibilidad se toma como una propiedad de los mundos (abstractos) posibles. Esta formulación es lo suficientemente flexible como para permitir el tiempo de incorporación;Aún así, en nuestro enfoque, el tiempo es inherente a la plausibilidad en lugar de incidental. En segundo lugar, nuestro marco está más orientado computacionalmente. La implementación de la plausibilidad temporal en [7, 8] se basa en el enfoque de sistemas interpretados con puntos de tiempo (R, M) sujetos a plausibilidad. Como las ejecuciones se incluyen en los puntos de tiempo, también se pueden definir plausibles o inverosímil.7 Sin embargo, también significa que los puntos de tiempo sirven al papel de posibles mundos en la formulación básica, que produce estructuras de Kripke con espacios mundiales incontables en todos, excepto en ella mayoría de los casos triviales. En tercer lugar, [7, 8] construya sobre el tiempo lineal: una ejecución (más precisamente, un momento de tiempo (r, m)) se fija cuando se interpreta una fórmula. Por el contrario, usamos el tiempo de ramificación con cuantificación explícita sobre la ruta temporal.8 Creemos que el tiempo de ramificación es más adecuado para dominios no deterministas (véase, por ejemplo, [4]), de los cuales los sistemas de múltiples agentes son un excelente ejemplo. Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo de ramificación hace que nuestra noción de creencia sea diferente de Friedman y Halperns. En particular, la propiedad Kϕ → Bϕ es válida en su enfoque, pero no en el nuestro: un agente el 7 de mayo Friedman y Halpern incluso mencionan brevemente cómo la plausibilidad de las corridas puede incrustarse en su marco.8 Para ser más preciso, el tiempo en [7] se ramifica implícitamente en los estados epistémicos. Esto se debe a que (R, M) ∼A (R, M) IFF como estado local correspondiente a ambos puntos de tiempo es el mismo (RA (M) = RA (M)). En consecuencia, la semántica de Kaϕ se puede leer como para cada carrera, y cada momento en esta carrera que produce el mismo estado local que ahora, ϕ Hels.586 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) saben que, en principio, es posible que algún curso de eventos sea posible, sin creer que realmente puede convertirse en el caso (ver Sección 4.2). Como sugiere la Proposición 13, una distinción tan sutil entre conocimiento y creencias es posible en nuestro enfoque porque las lógicas de tiempo de ramificación permiten cuantificación existencial sobre las ejecuciones. En cuarto lugar, mientras que los modelos Friedman y Halperns son muy flexibles, también permiten descripciones del sistema que pueden parecer contradictorio. Suponga que (R, M) es plausible en sí mismo (formalmente: (R, M) es Mínimo WRT (R, M, A)), pero (R, M + 1) no es plausible en (R, M + 1). Esto significa que seguir el camino plausible lo hace inverosímil (cf. Observación 1), que es aún más extraña en el caso del tiempo lineal. Combinando el argumento con aspectos computacionales, sugerimos que nuestro enfoque puede ser más natural y directo para muchas aplicaciones. Por último, pero no menos importante, nuestra lógica proporciona un mecanismo para especificar (y actualizar) conjuntos de rutas plausibles en el lenguaje de objetos. Por lo tanto, los conjuntos de plausibilidad se pueden especificar de manera sucinta, que es otra característica que hace que nuestro marco sea amigable con el cálculo. Los resultados de verificación del modelo de la Sección 5 son especialmente alentadores en esta luz.4. Plausibilidad, conocimiento y creencias en CTLKP En esta sección estudiamos algunas propiedades relevantes de la plausibilidad, el conocimiento y las creencias;En particular, se examinan los axiomas KDT45. Pero primero, identificamos dos subclases importantes de modelos con plausibilidad. Un modelo CTLKP es plausiblemente en serie (o P-serial) para el agente A si cada estado del sistema es parte de una ruta plausible de acuerdo con A, es decir, en (υA) = Q. Como veremos más adelante, un requisito más débil a veces es suficiente. Llamamos a un modelo débilmente P-serial si cada estado tiene al menos una contraparte indistinguible que se encuentra en una ruta plausible, es decir, para cada q ∈ Q hay una q ∈ Q tal que q ∼A q y q ∈ (υA). Obviamente, la serialidad P implica la serialidad P débil. Obtenemos la siguiente caracterización de ambas clases de modelos. Proposición 4. M es plausiblemente serial para el agente Una fórmula IFF PL ae f es válida en M. M es débilmente P-Serial para el agente A IFF ¬kapl aa f⊥ es válido en M. 4.1 Propiedades axiomáticas Teorema 5. Los axiomas K, D, 4 y 5 para el conocimiento son fuertemente válidos, y el axioma t es válido. Es decir, las modalidades Ka forman el sistema S5 en el sentido de validez normal, y KD45 en el sentido de una fuerte validez. No incluimos pruebas aquí debido a la falta de espacio. Se remite al lector interesado a [2], donde se dan pruebas detalladas. Proposición 6. Los axiomas K, 4 y 5 para las creencias son muy válidos. Es decir, tenemos: | ≡ (baϕ ∧ ba (ϕ → ψ)) → baψ, | ≡ (baϕ → babaya), y | ≡ (¬baϕ → ba¬baϕ). La siguiente proposición se refiere al axioma de consistencia D: Baϕ → ¬Ba¬ϕ. Es fácil ver que el axioma no es válido en general: ya que no tenemos restricciones en los conjuntos de plausibilidad υA, también puede ser que υA = ∅. En ese caso tenemos baϕ ∧ Ba¬ϕ para todas las fórmulas ϕ, porque el conjunto de estados a considerar se vuelve vacío. Sin embargo, resulta que D es válido para una clase muy natural de modelos. Proposición 7. Axiom D para las creencias no es válido en la clase de todos los modelos CTLKP. Sin embargo, es fuertemente válido en la clase de modelos P-Seriales débiles (y, por lo tanto, también en la clase de modelos P-seriales). Además, como es de esperar, las creencias no tienen que ser siempre ciertas. Proposición 8. Axiom t para las creencias no es válido;es decir, | = (Baϕ → ϕ). El axioma ni siquiera es válido en la clase de modelos P-seriales. Teorema 9. Las modalidades de creencias BA forman el sistema K45 en la clase de todos los modelos, y KD45 en la clase de modelos de seriales débilmente plausiblemente (en el sentido de validez normal y fuerte). Axiom t ni siquiera es válido para los modelos P-seriales.4.2 Plausibilidad, conocimiento y creencias Primero, investigamos la relación entre el conocimiento y la plausibilidad/operadores de fisicalidad. Luego, observamos la interacción entre conocimiento y creencias. Proposición 10. Sea ϕ una fórmula CTLKP, y M sea un modelo CTLKP. Tenemos las siguientes valididades fuertes: (i) | ≡ pl Akaϕ ↔ kaϕ (ii) | ≡ ph kaϕ ↔ kaph ϕ y | ≡ kaph ϕ ↔ kaϕ ahora queremos examinar la relación entre el conocimiento y la creencia. Por ejemplo, si el agente A cree en algo, sabe que lo cree. O, si él sabe un hecho, también cree que lo sabe. Por otro lado, por ejemplo, un agente no necesariamente cree en todas las cosas que sabe. Por ejemplo, podemos saber que una invasión de otra galaxia es en principio posible (kae ♦ invasión), pero si no consideramos esta posibilidad como plausible (¬pl ae ♦ invasión), entonces rechazamos la creencia correspondiente en consecuencia (¬Bae ♦ Invasión). Tenga en cuenta que esta propiedad refleja la fuerte conexión entre la creencia y la plausibilidad en nuestro marco. Proposición 11. Las siguientes fórmulas son fuertemente válidas: (i) Baϕ → Kabaϕ, (ii) Kabaϕ → Baϕ, (iii) Kaϕ → Bakaϕ. Las siguientes fórmulas no son válidas: (iv) Baϕ → Bakaϕ, (v) Kaϕ → Baϕ La última invalidez es especialmente importante: no es el caso que saber algo implica creer en él. Esto enfatiza que estudiamos un concepto específico de creencias aquí. Tenga en cuenta que su específico no se debe a la definición de creencias basada en la plausibilidad. La razón radica más bien en el hecho de que investigamos el conocimiento, las creencias y la plausibilidad en un marco temporal, como muestra la Proposición 12. Proposición 12. Sea ϕ una fórmula CTLKP que no incluye operadores temporales. Entonces Kaϕ → Baϕ es muy válido, y en la clase de modelos P-seriales tenemos incluso que | ≡ Kaϕ ↔ Baϕ. El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 587 Además, es importante que usemos el tiempo de ramificación con cuantificación explícita sobre las rutas;Esta observación se formaliza en la Proposición 13. Definición 1. Definimos el sublenguaje universal de CTLK de una manera similar a [21]: ϕu :: = P |¬P |ϕU ∧ ϕU |ϕU ∨ ϕU |Aγu |Kaϕu, γu :: = fϕU |2 ϕU |ϕuu ϕu. Llamamos tales fórmulas universales ϕu y fórmulas de ruta universal γu. Proposición 13. Sea ϕu una fórmula CTLK universal. Entonces | ≡ kaϕu → baϕu. Los siguientes dos teoremas caracterizan la relación entre conocimiento y creencias: primero para la clase de modelos P-seriales, y luego, finalmente, para todos los modelos. Teorema 14. Las siguientes fórmulas son fuertemente válidas en la clase de modelos CTLKP de plausiblemente en serie: (i) Ba está ↔ Kapl Aϕ, (ii) Kaϕ ↔ Baph ϕ.Teorema 15. La fórmula BAϕ ↔ Kapl A (E F → ϕ) es muy válida. Tenga en cuenta que esta caracterización tiene una lectura de sentido común fuerte: creer en ϕ es saber que ϕ se mantiene plausiblemente en todas las situaciones plausiblemente imaginables.4.3 Propiedades de la actualización La primera propiedad notable de la actualización de plausibilidad es que solo influye en las fórmulas en las que la plausibilidad juega un papel, es decir, en las que ocurren las modalidades de creencia o plausibilidad. Proposición 16. Sea ϕ sea una fórmula CTLKP que no incluya operadores PL A y BA, y γ sea una fórmula de ruta CTLKP. Luego, tenemos | ≡ ϕ ↔ (Set-PLA γ) ϕ. ¿Qué se puede decir sobre el resultado de una actualización? A primera vista, la fórmula (Set-PLA γ) PL AAγ parece una caracterización natural;Sin embargo, no es válido. Esto se debe a que, al dejar los otros caminos (inverosímil) fuera del alcance, podemos dejar fuera de | γ |Algunos caminos que se necesitaban para satisfacer γ (ver el ejemplo en la Sección 4.2). Proponemos dos formas alternativas: la primera restringe el idioma de la actualización de manera similar a [21];El otro se refiere a posibilidades físicas, de alguna manera análoga a [13]. Proposición 17. La fórmula CTLKP (SET-PLA γ) PL AAγ no es válida. Sin embargo, tenemos las siguientes valididades: (i) | ≡ (Set-PLA γu) PL AAγu, donde γu es una fórmula de ruta CTLK universal de la definición 1. (ii) Si ϕ, ϕ1, ϕ2 son fórmulas arbitrarias de CTLK, entonces:| ≡ (Set-PLA fϕ) PL AA F (pH ϕ), | ≡ (Set-PLA 2 ϕ) PL AA2 (pH ϕ) y | ≡ (Set-PLA ϕ1u ϕ2) Pl AA (pH ϕ1) U (PH ϕ2).5. Verificación de plausibilidad, tiempo y creencias En esta sección Informamos resultados preliminares sobre la verificación del modelo de las fórmulas CTLKP. Claramente, verificar las propiedades de CTLKP directamente contra modelos con plausibilidad no tiene mucho sentido, ya que estos modelos son inherentemente infinitos;Lo que necesitamos es una representación finita de los conjuntos de plausibilidad. Una de esas representaciones se ha discutido en la Sección 3.3: los conjuntos de plausibilidad pueden definirse mediante fórmulas de ruta y el operador de actualización (set-PLA γ). Seguimos esta idea aquí, estudiando la complejidad de la verificación del modelo de las fórmulas CTLKP contra los modelos CTLK (que puede verse como una representación compacta de los modelos CTLKP en los que se suponen todas las rutas plausibles), con la idea subyacente de que los conjuntos de plausibilidad, cuando es necesario, cuando es necesario,debe definirse explícitamente en el lenguaje de objetos. A continuación, dibujamos un algoritmo que verifica las fórmulas CTLKP en el tiempo WRT lineal del tamaño del modelo y la longitud de la fórmula. Esto significa que hemos extendido CTLK a un lenguaje más expresivo sin un precio computacional que pagar. En primer lugar, nos deshacemos de los operadores de creencias (debido al Teorema 15), reemplazando cada ocurrencia de BAϕ con KAPL A (E F → ϕ). Ahora, deje que - → γ = γ1, ..., γk sea un vector de fórmulas de la ruta de vainilla (una por agente), con el vector inicial - → γ0 =, ..., y - → γ [γ /A]Vector de denota - → γ, en el que - → γ [a] se reemplaza con γ. Además, definimos - → γ [0] =. Traducimos las fórmulas CTLKP resultantes a las que sin plausibilidad a través de la función tr (ϕ) = tr− → γ0,0 (ϕ), definido de la siguiente manera: Tr− → γ, I (P) = P, Tr− → γ, I (I (ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2) = Tr− → γ, I (ϕ1) ∧ Tr− → γ, I (ϕ2), Tr− → γ, I (¬ϕ) = ¬tr− → γ, I (ϕ), Tr− →γ, i (ka sig) = ka tr− → γ, 0 (ϕ), tr− → γ, i (PLA ϕ) = TR− → γ, A (ϕ), Tr− → γ, I ((Set-PLAγ) ϕ) = Tr− → γ [γ /A], I (ϕ), Tr− → γ, I (pH ϕ) = TR− → γ, 0 (ϕ), Tr− → γ, I (Fϕ)= ftr− → γ, i (ϕ), tr− → γ, i (2 ϕ) = 2 tr− → γ, i (ϕ), tr− → γ, i (ϕ1u ϕ2) = tr− → γ, i(ϕ1) U Tr− → γ, I (ϕ2), Tr− → γ, I (Eγ) = E ( - → γ [I] ∧ TR− → γ, I (γ)). Tenga en cuenta que las oraciones resultantes pertenecen a la lógica de CTLK+, es decir, CTL+ (donde cada cuantificador de ruta puede ser seguido por una combinación booleana de fórmulas de camino de vainilla) 9 con modalidades epistémicas. La siguiente propuesta justifica la traducción. Proposición 18. Para cualquier fórmula CTLKP ϕ sin BA, tenemos que m, q | = Ctlkp ϕ iff m, q | = ctlk+ tr (ϕ). En general, la verificación del modelo CTL+ (y también CTLK+) es ΔP 2 -complicado. Sin embargo, en nuestro caso, las combinaciones booleanas de las subformeras de ruta son siempre conjunciones de como máximo dos elementos no negados, lo que nos permite proponer el siguiente algoritmo de verificación del modelo. Primero, las subformeras se evalúan de manera recursiva: para cada subformula ψ de ϕ, el conjunto de estados en M que satisfacen ψ se calculan y se etiqueta con una nueva proposición Pψ. Ahora, es suficiente para definir la verificación M, Q | = ϕ para ϕ en las que todas las subformeras (estado) son proposiciones, con los siguientes casos: Caso M, Q | = E (2 P ∧ γ): si M, Q |= P, luego regresa no. De lo contrario, elimine de M todos los estados que no satisfacen P (produciendo un modelo más disperso M), y verifique la fórmula CTL Eγ en M, Q con cualquier verificador de modelos CTL. Caso M, Q | = E (FP ∧ γ): cree M agregando una copia Q del estado q, en la que solo se mantienen las transiciones a los estados que satisfacen P (es decir, m, q | = r iff m, q | =r; y q rq iff qrq y m, q | = p). Luego, verifique Eγ en m, q.9 para la semántica de CTL+, y la discusión de la complejidad de verificación del modelo, cf.[17].588 El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Caso M, Q | = E (P1U P2 ∧ P3U P4): Tenga en cuenta que esto es equivalente a la comprobación de E (P1 ∧ P3) U (P2 ∧ EP3U P4) ∨ E (P1 ∧ P3) U (P4 ∧ EP1U P2), que es una fórmula CTL. Otros casos: los casos anteriores cubren todas las fórmulas posibles que comienzan con un cuantificador de ruta. Para otros casos, se puede usar la verificación del modelo CTLK estándar. Teorema 19. La comprobación de modelos CTLKP contra los modelos CTLK es completado PTIME, y se puede hacer en el tiempo O (ml), donde M es el número de transiciones en el modelo, y L es la longitud de la fórmula que se verifica. Es decir, la complejidad no es peor que para CTLK en sí.6. Conclusiones En este documento se considera una noción de comportamiento plausible, con la idea subyacente de que las opciones inverosímil generalmente deben ignorarse en el razonamiento práctico sobre posibles cursos de acción futuros. Agregamos la nueva noción de plausibilidad a la lógica de CTLK [19], y obtenemos un lenguaje que permite un razonamiento sobre lo que puede (o debe) suceder plausiblemente. Como dispositivo técnico para definir la semántica de la lógica resultante, utilizamos una relación de satisfacción no estándar | = P que permite propagar el conjunto actual de rutas plausibles en subformeras. Además, proponemos una noción de creencias no estándar, definida en términos de indistinguibilidad y plausibilidad. También proponemos cómo se pueden especificar los supuestos de plausibilidad en el lenguaje de objetos a través de un operador de actualización de plausibilidad (de una manera similar a [13]). Utilizamos este nuevo marco para investigar algunas propiedades importantes de plausibilidad, conocimiento, creencias y actualizaciones. En particular, mostramos que el conocimiento es una modalidad S5, y que las creencias satisfacen los axiomas K45 en general, y KD45 para la clase de modelos seriales plausiblemente. También probamos que creer en ϕ es saber que ϕ se mantiene plausiblemente en todas las situaciones posibles plausiblemente. Es decir, la relación entre conocimiento y creencias es muy natural y refleja la intuición inicial con precisión. Además, los resultados de verificación del modelo de la Sección 5 muestran que la verificación para CTLKP no es más compleja que para CTL y CTLK. Nos gustaría enfatizar que no vemos esta contribución como un mero ejercicio técnico en la lógica formal. Los agentes humanos usan un concepto similar de plausibilidad y creencias prácticas en su razonamiento cotidiano para reducir el espacio de búsqueda y hacer que el razonamiento sea factible. Como consecuencia, sugerimos que el marco que proponemos puede ser adecuado para agentes de modelado, diseño y análisis de recursos en general. Nos gustaría agradecer a Juergen Dix por sus fructíferas discusiones, comentarios útiles y mejoras.7. Referencias [1] R. Alur, T. A. Henzinger y O. Kupferman. Lógica temporal de tiempo alterno.

        "Finally, we discuss related work [7, 8, 20, 18, 16], and compare it with our approach. 3.1 The Concept of Plausibility It is well known how knowledge (or beliefs) can be modeled with Kripke structures.",

        "Clearly, there should be a connection between these two notions.",
        "Our approach is to use the notion of plausibility for this purpose.",
        "Plausibility can serve as a primitive concept that helps to define the semantics of beliefs, in a similar way as indistinguishability of states (represented by relation ∼a) is the semantic concept that underlies knowledge.",
        "In this sense, our work follows [7, 20]: essentially, beliefs are what an agent would know if he took only plausible options into account.",
        "In our approach, however, plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property.",
        "That is, we do not consider states (or possible worlds) to be more plausible than others but rather define some behaviors to be plausible, and others implausible.",
        "Moreover, behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the Kripke structure modeling a multi-agent system.",
        "An actual notion of plausibility (that is, a particular set of plausible paths) can emerge in many different ways.",
        "It may result from observations and learning; an agent can learn from its observations and see specific patterns of events as plausible (a lot of people wear black shoes if they wear a suit).",
        "Knowledge exchange is another possibility (e.g., an agent a can tell agent b that player c always bluffs when he is smiling).",
        "Game theory, with its rationality criteria (undominated strategies, maxmin, Nash equilibrium etc.) is another viable source of plausibility assumptions.",
        "Last but not least, folk knowledge can be used to establish plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior (players normally want to win a game, people want to live).",
        "In any case, restricting the reasoning to plausible possibilities can be essential if we want to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all possibilities (we call them physical possibilities in the rest of the paper) is exceedingly large in real life.",
        "Of course, this does not exclude a more extensive analysis in special cases, e.g. when our plausibility assumptions do not seem accurate any more, or when the cost of The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 583 inaccurate assumptions can be too high (as in the case of high-budget business decisions).",
        "But even in these cases, we usually do not get rid of plausibility assumptions completely - we only revise them to make them more cautious.3 To formalize this idea, we extend models of CTLK with sets of plausible paths and add plausibility operators Pl a, physical paths operator Ph , and belief operators Ba to the language of CTLK.",
        "Now, it is possible to make statements that refer to plausible paths only, as well as statements that regard all paths that may occur in the system. 3.2 CTLK with Plausibility In this section, we extend the logic of CTLK with plausibility; we call the resulting logic CTLKP.",
        "Formally, the language of CTLKP is defined as: ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Eγ | Pl aϕ | Ph ϕ | Kaϕ | Baϕ γ ::= fϕ | 2 ϕ | ϕU ϕ.",
        "For instance, we may claim it is plausible to assume that a shop is closed after the opening hours, though the manager may be physically able to open it at any time: Pl aA2 (late → ¬open) ∧ Ph E♦ (late ∧ open).",
        "The semantics of CTLKP extends that of CTLK as follows.",
        "Firstly, we augment the models with sets of plausible paths.",
        "A model with plausibility is given as M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Υ1, ..., Υk, π , where Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, π is a CTLK model, and Υa ⊆ ΛM is the set of paths in M that are plausible according to agent a.",
        "If we want to make it clear that Υa is taken from model M, we will write ΥM a .",
        "It seems worth emphasizing that this notion of plausibility is subjective and holistic.",
        "It is subjective because Υa represents agent as subjective view on what is plausible - and indeed, different agents may have different ideas on plausibility (i.e., Υa may differ from Υb).",
        "It is holistic because Υa represents agent as idea of the plausible behavior of the whole system (including the behavior of other agents).",
        "Remark 1.",
        "In our models, plausibility is also global, i.e., plausibility sets do not depend on the state of the system.",
        "Investigating systems, in which plausibility is relativized with respect to states (like in [7]), might be an interesting avenue of future work.",
        "However, such an approach - while obviously more flexible - allows for potentially counterintuitive system descriptions.",
        "For example, it might be the case that path λ is plausible in q = λ[0], but the set of plausible paths in q = λ[1] is empty.",
        "That is, by following plausible path λ we are bound to get to an implausible situation.",
        "But then, does it make sense to consider λ as plausible?",
        "Secondly, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P , which we call plausible satisfaction.",
        "Let M be a CTLKP 3 That is, when planning to open an industrial plant in the UK, we will probably consider the possibility of our main contractor taking her life, but we will still not take into account the possibilities of: an invasion of UFO, England being destroyed by a meteorite, Fidel Castro becoming the British Prime Minister etc.",
        "Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case, they also have a very small influence on our final decision, but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options. model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M (not necessarily any ΥM a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only.",
        "The absolute satisfaction relation |= is defined as |=ΛM .",
        "Let on(P) be the set of all states that lie on at least one path in P, i.e. on(P) = {q ∈ Q | ∃λ ∈ P∃i (λ[i] = q)}.",
        "Now, the semantics of CTLKP can be given through the following clauses: M, q |=P p iff q ∈ π(p); M, q |=P ¬ϕ iff M, q |=P ϕ; M, q |=P ϕ ∧ ψ iff M, q |=P ϕ and M, q |=P ψ; M, q |=P E fϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[1] |=P ϕ; M, q |=P E2 ϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[i] |=P ϕ for every i ≥ 0; M, q |=P EϕU ψ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P and i ≥ 0 such that M, λ[i] |=P ψ, and M, λ[j] |=P ϕ for every 0 ≤ j < i; M, q |=P Pl aϕ iff M, q |=Υa ϕ; M, q |=P Ph ϕ iff M, q |= ϕ; M, q |=P Kaϕ iff M, q |= ϕ for every q such that q ∼a q ; M, q |=P Baϕ iff for all q ∈ on(Υa) with q ∼a q , we have that M, q |=Υa ϕ.",
        "One of the main reasons for using the concept of plausibility is that we want to define agents beliefs out of more primitive concepts - in our case, these are plausibility and indistinguishability - in a way analogous to [20, 7].",
        "If an agent knows that ϕ, he must be sure about it.",
        "However, beliefs of an agent are not necessarily about reliable facts.",
        "Still, they should make sense to the agent; if he believes that ϕ, then the formula should at least hold in all futures that he envisages as plausible.",
        "Thus, beliefs of an agent may be seen as things known to him if he disregards all non-plausible possibilities.",
        "We say that ϕ is M-true (M |= ϕ) if M, q |= ϕ for all q ∈ QM. ϕ is valid (|= ϕ) if M |= ϕ for all models M. ϕ is M-strongly true (M |≡ ϕ) if M, q |=P ϕ for all q ∈ QM and all P ⊆ ΛM. ϕ is strongly valid ( |≡ ϕ) if M |≡ ϕ for all models M. Proposition 2.",
        "Strong truth and strong validity imply truth and validity, respectively.",
        "The reverse does not hold.",
        "Ultimately, we are going to be interested in normal (not strong) validity, as parameterizing the satisfaction relation with a set P is just a technical device for propagating sets of plausible paths Υa into the semantics of nested formulae.",
        "The importance of strong validity, however, lies in the fact that |≡ ϕ ↔ ψ makes ϕ and ψ completely interchangeable, while the same is not true for normal validity.",

        "Formally, we model the game with a CTLKP model M, in which the set of states Q includes qs for the initial situation, states qr, r ∈ [0, 1], for the situations after a has chosen number r, and final states qw, ql for the winning and the losing situation, respectively.",
        "The transition relation is as follows: qsRqr and qrRql for all r ∈ [0, 1]; q1Rqw, qwRqw, and qlRql.",
        "Moreover, π(one) = {q1} and π(win) = {qw}.",

        "In this section we present a dynamic approach where an actual notion of plausibility can be specified in the object language.",

        "One logical solution is given by using path formulae γ.",
        "These formulae describe properties of paths; therefore, a specific formula can be used to characterize a set of paths.",
        "For instance, think about a country in Africa where it has never snowed.",
        "Then, plausible paths might be defined as ones in which it never snows, i.e., all paths that satisfy 2 ¬snows.",
        "Formally, let γ be a CTLK path formula.",
        "We define |γ|M to be the set of paths that satisfy γ in model M: | fϕ|M = {λ | M, λ[1] |= ϕ} |2 ϕ|M = {λ | ∀i (M, λ[i] |= ϕ)} |ϕ1U ϕ2|M = {λ | ∃i ` M, λ[i] |= ϕ2 ∧ ∀j(0 ≤ j < i ⇒ M, λ[j] |= ϕ1) ´ }.",
        "Moreover, we define the plausible paths model update as follows.",
        "Let M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Υ1, ..., Υk, π be a CTLKP model, and let P ⊆ ΛM be a set of paths.",
        "Then Ma,P = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Υ1, ..., Υa−1, P, Υa+1, ..., Υk, π denotes model M with as set of plausible paths reset to P. Now we can extend the language of CTLKP with formulae (set-pla γ)ϕ with the intuitive reading: suppose that γ exactly characterizes the set of plausible paths, then ϕ holds, and formal semantics given below: M, q |=P (set-pla γ)ϕ iff Ma,|γ|M , q |=P ϕ.",
        "We observe that this update scheme is similar to the one proposed in [13]. 3.4 Comparison to Related Work Several modal notions of plausibility were already discussed in the existing literature [7, 8, 20, 18, 16].",
        "In these papers, like in ours, plausibility is used as a primitive semantic concept that helps to define beliefs on top of agents knowledge.",
        "A similar idea was introduced by Moses and Shoham in [18].",
        "Their work preceded both [7, 8] and [20]and although Moses and Shoham do not explicitly mention the term plausibility, it seems appropriate to summarize their idea first.",
        "Moses and Shoham: Beliefs as Conditional Knowledge In [18], beliefs are relativized with respect to a formula α (which can be seen as a plausibility assumption expressed in the object language).",
        "More precisely, worlds that satisfy α can be considered as plausible.",
        "This concept is expressed via symbols Bα i ϕ; the index i ∈ {1, 2, 3} is used to distinguish between three different implementations of beliefs.",
        "The first version is given by Bα 1 ϕ ≡ K(α → ϕ).4 A drawback of this version is that if α is false, then everything will be believed with respect to α.",
        "The second version overcomes this problem: Bα 2 ϕ ≡ K(α → ϕ) ∧ (K¬α → Kϕ); now ϕ is only believed if it is known that ϕ follows from assumption α, and ϕ must be known if assumption α is known to be false.",
        "Finally, Bα 3 ϕ ≡ K(α → ϕ) ∧ ¬K¬α: if the assumption α is known to be false, nothing should be believed with respect to α.",
        "The strength of these different notions is given as follows: Bα 3 ϕ implies Bα 2 ϕ, and Bα 2 ϕ implies Bα 1 ϕ.",
        "In this approach, belief is strongly connected to knowledge in the sense that belief is knowledge with respect to a given assumption.",
        "Friedman and Halpern: Plausibility Spaces The work of Friedman and Halpern [7] extends the concepts of knowledge and belief with an explicit notion of plausibility; i.e., some worlds are more plausible for an agent than others.",
        "To implement this idea, Kripke models are extended with function P which assigns a plausibility space P(q, a) = (Ω(q,a), (q,a)) to every state, or more generally every possible world q, and agent a.",

        "Logics of plausibility can be seen as a qualitative description of agents preferences/knowledge; logics of probability [6, 15], on the other hand, offer a quantitative description.",
        "The logic from [7] is defined by the following grammar: ϕ ::= p | ϕ∧ϕ | ¬ϕ | Kaϕ | ϕ →a ϕ, where the semantics of all operators except →a is given as usual, and formulae ϕ →a ψ have the meaning that ψ is true in the most plausible worlds in which ϕ holds.",
        "Formally, the semantics for →a is given as: M, q |= ϕ →a ψ iff Sϕ P (q,a) →P(q,a) Sψ P (q,a), where Sϕ (q,a) = {q ∈ Ω(q,a) | M, q |= ϕ} are the states in Ω(q,a) that satisfy ϕ.",
        "The idea of defining beliefs is given by the assumption that an agent believes in something if he knows that it is true in the most plausible worlds of Ω(q,a); formally, this can be stated as Baϕ ≡ Ka( →a ϕ).",
        "Friedman and Halpern have shown that the KD45 axioms are valid for operator Ba if plausibility spaces satisfy consistency (for all states q ∈ Q it holds that Ω(q,a) ⊆ { q ∈ Q | q ∼a q }) and normality (for all states q ∈ Q it holds that Ω(q,a) = ∅).6 A temporal extension of the language (mentioned briefly in [7], and discussed in more detail in [8]) uses the interpreted systems approach [10, 5].",
        "A system R is given by runs, where a run r : N → Q is a function from time moments (modeled by N) to global states, and a time point (r, i) is given by a time point i ∈ N and a run r. A global state is a combination of local states, one per agent.",
        "An interpreted system M = (R, π) is given by a system R and a valuation of propositions π. Epistemic relations are defined over time points, i.e., (r , m ) ∼a (r, m) iff agent as local states ra(m ) and ra(m) of (r , m ) and (r, m) are equal.",

        "The logic does not include temporal formulae, although it might be extended with temporal operators, as time is already present in KBC models.",
        "What Are the Differences to Our Logic?",
        "In our approach, plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property, i.e., it is a property of temporal paths rather than states.",
        "In the object language, this is reflected by the fact that plausibility assumptions are specified through path formulae.",
        "In contrast, the approach of [18] and [20] is static: not only the logics do not include operators for talking about time and/or change, but these are states that are assumed plausible or not in their semantics.",
        "The differences to [7, 8] are more subtle.",
        "Firstly, the framework of Friedman and Halpern is static in the sense that plausibility is taken as a property of (abstract) possible worlds.",
        "This formulation is flexible enough to allow for incorporating time; still, in our approach, time is inherent to plausibility rather than incidental.",
        "Secondly, our framework is more computationally oriented.",
        "The implementation of temporal plausibility in [7, 8] is based on the interpreted systems approach with time points (r, m) being subject to plausibility.",
        "As runs are included in time points, they can also be defined plausible or implausible.7 However, it also means that time points serve the role of possible worlds in the basic formulation, which yields Kripke structures with uncountable possible world spaces in all but the most trivial cases.",
        "Thirdly, [7, 8] build on linear time: a run (more precisely, a time moment (r, m)) is fixed when a formula is interpreted.",
        "In contrast, we use branching time with explicit quantification over temporal paths.8 We believe that branching time is more suitable for non-deterministic domains (cf. e.g. [4]), of which multi-agent systems are a prime example.",
        "Note that branching time makes our notion of belief different from Friedman and Halperns.",
        "Most notably, property Kϕ → Bϕ is valid in their approach, but not in ours: an agent may 7 Friedman and Halpern even briefly mention how plausibility of runs can be embedded in their framework. 8 To be more precise, time in [7] does implicitly branch at epistemic states.",
        "This is because (r, m) ∼a (r , m ) iff as local state corresponding to both time points is the same (ra(m) = ra(m )).",
        "In consequence, the semantics of Kaϕ can be read as for every run, and every moment on this run that yields the same local state as now, ϕ holds. 586 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) know that some course of events is in principle possible, without believing that it can really become the case (see Section 4.2).",
        "As Proposition 13 suggests, such a subtle distinction between knowledge and beliefs is possible in our approach because branching time logics allow for existential quantification over runs.",
        "Fourthly, while Friedman and Halperns models are very flexible, they also enable system descriptions that may seem counterintuitive.",
        "Suppose that (r, m) is plausible in itself (formally: (r, m) is minimal wrt (r,m,a)), but (r, m + 1) is not plausible in (r, m + 1).",

        "We also propose how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility update operator (in a way similar to [13]).",
        "We use this new framework to investigate some important properties of plausibility, knowledge, beliefs, and updates.",
        "In particular, we show that knowledge is an S5 modality, and that beliefs satisfy axioms K45 in general, and KD45 for the class of plausibly serial models.",
        "We also prove that believing in ϕ is knowing that ϕ plausibly holds in all plausibly possible situations.",
        "That is, the relationship between knowledge and beliefs is very natural and reflects the initial intuition precisely.",
        "Moreover, the model checking results from Section 5 show that verification for CTLKP is no more complex than for CTL and CTLK.",
        "We would like to stress that we do not see this contribution as a mere technical exercise in formal logic.",
        "Human agents use a similar concept of plausibility and practical beliefs in their everyday reasoning in order to reduce the search space and make the reasoning feasible.",

                "Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case, they also have a very small influence on our final decision, but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options. model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M (not necessarily any ΥM a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only.",

                "That is, we do not consider states (or possible worlds) to be more plausible than others but rather define some behaviors to be plausible, and others implausible.",
                "Moreover, behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the Kripke structure modeling a multi-agent system.",
                "An actual notion of plausibility (that is, a particular set of plausible paths) can emerge in many different ways.",
                "It may result from observations and learning; an agent can learn from its observations and see specific patterns of events as plausible (a lot of people wear black shoes if they wear a suit).",
                "Knowledge exchange is another possibility (e.g., an agent a can tell agent b that player c always bluffs when he is smiling).",

                "Last but not least, folk knowledge can be used to establish plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior (players normally want to win a game, people want to live).",
                "In any case, restricting the reasoning to plausible possibilities can be essential if we want to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all possibilities (we call them physical possibilities in the rest of the paper) is exceedingly large in real life.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 583 inaccurate assumptions can be too high (as in the case of high-budget business decisions).",
                "But even in these cases, we usually do not get rid of plausibility assumptions completely - we only revise them to make them more cautious.3 To formalize this idea, we extend models of CTLK with sets of plausible paths and add plausibility operators Pl a, physical paths operator Ph , and belief operators Ba to the language of CTLK.",
                "Now, it is possible to make statements that refer to plausible paths only, as well as statements that regard all paths that may occur in the system. 3.2 CTLK with Plausibility In this section, we extend the logic of CTLK with plausibility; we call the resulting logic CTLKP.",
                "Formally, the language of CTLKP is defined as: ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Eγ | Pl aϕ | Ph ϕ | Kaϕ | Baϕ γ ::= fϕ | 2 ϕ | ϕU ϕ.",

                "Remark 1.",
                "In our models, plausibility is also global, i.e., plausibility sets do not depend on the state of the system.",
                "Investigating systems, in which plausibility is relativized with respect to states (like in [7]), might be an interesting avenue of future work.",
                "However, such an approach - while obviously more flexible - allows for potentially counterintuitive system descriptions.",
                "For example, it might be the case that path λ is plausible in q = λ[0], but the set of plausible paths in q = λ[1] is empty.",

                "But then, does it make sense to consider λ as plausible?",
                "Secondly, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P , which we call plausible satisfaction.",
                "Let M be a CTLKP 3 That is, when planning to open an industrial plant in the UK, we will probably consider the possibility of our main contractor taking her life, but we will still not take into account the possibilities of: an invasion of UFO, England being destroyed by a meteorite, Fidel Castro becoming the British Prime Minister etc.",
                "Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case, they also have a very small influence on our final decision, but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options. model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M (not necessarily any ΥM a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only.",

                "Now, the semantics of CTLKP can be given through the following clauses: M, q |=P p iff q ∈ π(p); M, q |=P ¬ϕ iff M, q |=P ϕ; M, q |=P ϕ ∧ ψ iff M, q |=P ϕ and M, q |=P ψ; M, q |=P E fϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[1] |=P ϕ; M, q |=P E2 ϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[i] |=P ϕ for every i ≥ 0; M, q |=P EϕU ψ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P and i ≥ 0 such that M, λ[i] |=P ψ, and M, λ[j] |=P ϕ for every 0 ≤ j < i; M, q |=P Pl aϕ iff M, q |=Υa ϕ; M, q |=P Ph ϕ iff M, q |= ϕ; M, q |=P Kaϕ iff M, q |= ϕ for every q such that q ∼a q ; M, q |=P Baϕ iff for all q ∈ on(Υa) with q ∼a q , we have that M, q |=Υa ϕ.",
                "One of the main reasons for using the concept of plausibility is that we want to define agents beliefs out of more primitive concepts - in our case, these are plausibility and indistinguishability - in a way analogous to [20, 7].",
                "If an agent knows that ϕ, he must be sure about it.",
                "However, beliefs of an agent are not necessarily about reliable facts.",

                "Then, we extend CTLK with the notion of plausibility by adding plausible path operators Pl a and physical path operator Ph to the logic.",
                "Formula Pl aϕ has the intended meaning: according to agent a, it is plausible that ϕ holds; formula Ph ϕ reads as: ϕ holds in all physically possible scenarios (i.e., even in implausible ones).",
                "The plausible path operator restricts statements only to those paths which are defined to be sensible, whereas the physical path operator generates statements about all paths that may theoretically occur.",
                "Furthermore, we define beliefs on top of plausibility and knowledge, as the facts that an agent would know if he assumed that only plausible things could happen.",
                "Finally, we discuss related work [7, 8, 20, 18, 16], and compare it with our approach. 3.1 The Concept of Plausibility It is well known how knowledge (or beliefs) can be modeled with Kripke structures.",
                "However, it is not so obvious how we can capture knowledge and beliefs in a sensible way in one framework.",
                "Clearly, there should be a connection between these two notions.",
                "Our approach is to use the notion of plausibility for this purpose.",
                "Plausibility can serve as a primitive concept that helps to define the semantics of beliefs, in a similar way as indistinguishability of states (represented by relation ∼a) is the semantic concept that underlies knowledge.",
                "In this sense, our work follows [7, 20]: essentially, beliefs are what an agent would know if he took only plausible options into account.",
                "In our approach, however, plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property.",
                "That is, we do not consider states (or possible worlds) to be more plausible than others but rather define some behaviors to be plausible, and others implausible.",
                "Moreover, behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the Kripke structure modeling a multi-agent system.",
                "An actual notion of plausibility (that is, a particular set of plausible paths) can emerge in many different ways.",
                "It may result from observations and learning; an agent can learn from its observations and see specific patterns of events as plausible (a lot of people wear black shoes if they wear a suit).",
                "Knowledge exchange is another possibility (e.g., an agent a can tell agent b that player c always bluffs when he is smiling).",
                "Game theory, with its rationality criteria (undominated strategies, maxmin, Nash equilibrium etc.) is another viable source of plausibility assumptions.",
                "Last but not least, folk knowledge can be used to establish plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior (players normally want to win a game, people want to live).",
                "In any case, restricting the <br>reasoning</br> to plausible possibilities can be essential if we want to make the <br>reasoning</br> feasible, as the space of all possibilities (we call them physical possibilities in the rest of the paper) is exceedingly large in real life.",
                "Of course, this does not exclude a more extensive analysis in special cases, e.g. when our plausibility assumptions do not seem accurate any more, or when the cost of The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 583 inaccurate assumptions can be too high (as in the case of high-budget business decisions).",
                "But even in these cases, we usually do not get rid of plausibility assumptions completely - we only revise them to make them more cautious.3 To formalize this idea, we extend models of CTLK with sets of plausible paths and add plausibility operators Pl a, physical paths operator Ph , and belief operators Ba to the language of CTLK.",
                "Now, it is possible to make statements that refer to plausible paths only, as well as statements that regard all paths that may occur in the system. 3.2 CTLK with Plausibility In this section, we extend the logic of CTLK with plausibility; we call the resulting logic CTLKP.",
                "Formally, the language of CTLKP is defined as: ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Eγ | Pl aϕ | Ph ϕ | Kaϕ | Baϕ γ ::= fϕ | 2 ϕ | ϕU ϕ.",
                "For instance, we may claim it is plausible to assume that a shop is closed after the opening hours, though the manager may be physically able to open it at any time: Pl aA2 (late → ¬open) ∧ Ph E♦ (late ∧ open).",

                "Firstly, we augment the models with sets of plausible paths.",
                "A model with plausibility is given as M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Υ1, ..., Υk, π , where Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, π is a CTLK model, and Υa ⊆ ΛM is the set of paths in M that are plausible according to agent a.",
                "If we want to make it clear that Υa is taken from model M, we will write ΥM a .",
                "It seems worth emphasizing that this notion of plausibility is subjective and holistic.",
                "It is subjective because Υa represents agent as subjective view on what is plausible - and indeed, different agents may have different ideas on plausibility (i.e., Υa may differ from Υb).",
                "It is holistic because Υa represents agent as idea of the plausible behavior of the whole system (including the behavior of other agents).",
                "Remark 1.",
                "In our models, plausibility is also global, i.e., plausibility sets do not depend on the state of the system.",
                "Investigating systems, in which plausibility is relativized with respect to states (like in [7]), might be an interesting avenue of future work.",
                "However, such an approach - while obviously more flexible - allows for potentially counterintuitive system descriptions.",
                "For example, it might be the case that path λ is plausible in q = λ[0], but the set of plausible paths in q = λ[1] is empty.",
                "That is, by following plausible path λ we are bound to get to an implausible situation.",
                "But then, does it make sense to consider λ as plausible?",
                "Secondly, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P , which we call plausible satisfaction.",
                "Let M be a CTLKP 3 That is, when planning to open an industrial plant in the UK, we will probably consider the possibility of our main contractor taking her life, but we will still not take into account the possibilities of: an invasion of UFO, England being destroyed by a meteorite, Fidel Castro becoming the British Prime Minister etc.",
                "Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case, they also have a very small influence on our final decision, but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options. model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M (not necessarily any ΥM a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only.",

                "Now, the semantics of CTLKP can be given through the following clauses: M, q |=P p iff q ∈ π(p); M, q |=P ¬ϕ iff M, q |=P ϕ; M, q |=P ϕ ∧ ψ iff M, q |=P ϕ and M, q |=P ψ; M, q |=P E fϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[1] |=P ϕ; M, q |=P E2 ϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[i] |=P ϕ for every i ≥ 0; M, q |=P EϕU ψ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P and i ≥ 0 such that M, λ[i] |=P ψ, and M, λ[j] |=P ϕ for every 0 ≤ j < i; M, q |=P Pl aϕ iff M, q |=Υa ϕ; M, q |=P Ph ϕ iff M, q |= ϕ; M, q |=P Kaϕ iff M, q |= ϕ for every q such that q ∼a q ; M, q |=P Baϕ iff for all q ∈ on(Υa) with q ∼a q , we have that M, q |=Υa ϕ.",
                "One of the main reasons for using the concept of plausibility is that we want to define agents beliefs out of more primitive concepts - in our case, these are plausibility and indistinguishability - in a way analogous to [20, 7].",

                "Last but not least, folk knowledge can be used to establish plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior (players normally want to win a game, people want to live).",
                "In any case, restricting the reasoning to plausible possibilities can be essential if we want to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all possibilities (we call them physical possibilities in the rest of the paper) is exceedingly large in real life.",

                "Now, it is possible to make statements that refer to plausible paths only, as well as statements that regard all paths that may occur in the system. 3.2 CTLK with Plausibility In this section, we extend the logic of CTLK with plausibility; we call the resulting logic CTLKP.",

                "Investigating systems, in which plausibility is relativized with respect to states (like in [7]), might be an interesting avenue of future work.",
                "However, such an approach - while obviously more flexible - allows for potentially counterintuitive system descriptions.",
                "For example, it might be the case that path λ is plausible in q = λ[0], but the set of plausible paths in q = λ[1] is empty.",

                "But then, does it make sense to consider λ as plausible?",
                "Secondly, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P , which we call plausible satisfaction.",
                "Let M be a CTLKP 3 That is, when planning to open an industrial plant in the UK, we will probably consider the possibility of our main contractor taking her life, but we will still not take into account the possibilities of: an invasion of UFO, England being destroyed by a meteorite, Fidel Castro becoming the British Prime Minister etc.",
                "Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case, they also have a very small influence on our final decision, but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options. model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M (not necessarily any ΥM a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only.",

                "In our approach, plausibility can be seen as a temporal property of behaviors.",
                "That is, some behaviors of the system can be assumed plausible and others implausible, with the underlying idea that the latter should perhaps be ignored in practical reasoning about possible future courses of action.",
                "Moreover, behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the Kripke structure modeling a multiagent system.",
                "As a consequence, we obtain a language to reason about what can (or must) plausibly happen.",
                "We propose a particular notion of beliefs (inspired by [20, 7]), defined in terms of epistemic relations and plausibility.",
                "The main intuition is that beliefs are facts that an agent would know if he assumed that only plausible things could happen.",
                "We believe that humans use such a concept of plausibility and practical beliefs quite often in their everyday reasoning.",
                "Restricting ones reasoning to plausible possibilities is essential to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all possibilities is exceedingly large in real life.",
                "We investigate some important properties of plausibility, knowledge, and belief in this new framework.",
                "In particular, we show that knowledge is an S5 modality, and that beliefs satisfy axioms K45 in general, and KD45 for the class of plausibly serial models.",
                "Finally, we show that the relationship between knowledge and belief for plausibly serial models is natural and reflects the initial intuition well.",
                "We also show how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility update operator, and we study properties of such updates.",
                "Finally, we show that model checking of the new logic is no more complex than model checking CTL and CTLK.",
                "Our ultimate goal is to come up with a logic that allows the study of strategies, time, knowledge, and plausible/rational behavior under both perfect and imperfect information.",
                "As combining all these dimensions is highly nontrivial (cf. [12, 14]) it seems reasonable to split this task.",
                "While this paper deals with knowledge, plausibility, and belief, the companion paper [11] proposes a general framework for multi-agent systems that regard game-theoretical rationality criteria like Nash equilibrium, Pareto optimality, etc.",

                "CTL includes operators for temporal properties of systems: i.e., path quantifier E (there is a path), together with temporal operators: f(in the next state), 2 (always from now on) and U (until).1 Every occurrence of a temporal operator is preceded by exactly one path quantifier in CTL (this variant of the language is sometimes called vanilla CTL).",

                "Formula Pl aϕ has the intended meaning: according to agent a, it is plausible that ϕ holds; formula Ph ϕ reads as: ϕ holds in all physically possible scenarios (i.e., even in implausible ones).",
                "The plausible path operator restricts statements only to those paths which are defined to be sensible, whereas the physical path operator generates statements about all paths that may theoretically occur.",

                "Finally, we discuss related work [7, 8, 20, 18, 16], and compare it with our approach. 3.1 The Concept of Plausibility It is well known how knowledge (or beliefs) can be modeled with Kripke structures.",
                "However, it is not so obvious how we can capture knowledge and beliefs in a sensible way in one framework.",
                "Clearly, there should be a connection between these two notions.",
                "Our approach is to use the notion of plausibility for this purpose.",
                "Plausibility can serve as a primitive concept that helps to define the semantics of beliefs, in a similar way as indistinguishability of states (represented by relation ∼a) is the semantic concept that underlies knowledge.",
                "In this sense, our work follows [7, 20]: essentially, beliefs are what an agent would know if he took only plausible options into account.",
                "In our approach, however, plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property.",
                "That is, we do not consider states (or possible worlds) to be more plausible than others but rather define some behaviors to be plausible, and others implausible.",
                "Moreover, behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the Kripke structure modeling a <br>multi-agent system</br>.",
                "An actual notion of plausibility (that is, a particular set of plausible paths) can emerge in many different ways.",
                "It may result from observations and learning; an agent can learn from its observations and see specific patterns of events as plausible (a lot of people wear black shoes if they wear a suit).",
                "Knowledge exchange is another possibility (e.g., an agent a can tell agent b that player c always bluffs when he is smiling).",
                "Game theory, with its rationality criteria (undominated strategies, maxmin, Nash equilibrium etc.) is another viable source of plausibility assumptions.",
                "Last but not least, folk knowledge can be used to establish plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior (players normally want to win a game, people want to live).",
                "In any case, restricting the reasoning to plausible possibilities can be essential if we want to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all possibilities (we call them physical possibilities in the rest of the paper) is exceedingly large in real life.",
                "Of course, this does not exclude a more extensive analysis in special cases, e.g. when our plausibility assumptions do not seem accurate any more, or when the cost of The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 583 inaccurate assumptions can be too high (as in the case of high-budget business decisions).",
                "But even in these cases, we usually do not get rid of plausibility assumptions completely - we only revise them to make them more cautious.3 To formalize this idea, we extend models of CTLK with sets of plausible paths and add plausibility operators Pl a, physical paths operator Ph , and belief operators Ba to the language of CTLK.",
                "Now, it is possible to make statements that refer to plausible paths only, as well as statements that regard all paths that may occur in the system. 3.2 CTLK with Plausibility In this section, we extend the logic of CTLK with plausibility; we call the resulting logic CTLKP.",
                "Formally, the language of CTLKP is defined as: ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Eγ | Pl aϕ | Ph ϕ | Kaϕ | Baϕ γ ::= fϕ | 2 ϕ | ϕU ϕ.",
                "For instance, we may claim it is plausible to assume that a shop is closed after the opening hours, though the manager may be physically able to open it at any time: Pl aA2 (late → ¬open) ∧ Ph E♦ (late ∧ open).",
                "The semantics of CTLKP extends that of CTLK as follows.",
                "Firstly, we augment the models with sets of plausible paths.",
                "A model with plausibility is given as M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Υ1, ..., Υk, π , where Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, π is a CTLK model, and Υa ⊆ ΛM is the set of paths in M that are plausible according to agent a.",
                "If we want to make it clear that Υa is taken from model M, we will write ΥM a .",
                "It seems worth emphasizing that this notion of plausibility is subjective and holistic.",
                "It is subjective because Υa represents agent as subjective view on what is plausible - and indeed, different agents may have different ideas on plausibility (i.e., Υa may differ from Υb).",
                "It is holistic because Υa represents agent as idea of the plausible behavior of the whole system (including the behavior of other agents).",
                "Remark 1.",
                "In our models, plausibility is also global, i.e., plausibility sets do not depend on the state of the system.",
                "Investigating systems, in which plausibility is relativized with respect to states (like in [7]), might be an interesting avenue of future work.",
                "However, such an approach - while obviously more flexible - allows for potentially counterintuitive system descriptions.",
                "For example, it might be the case that path λ is plausible in q = λ[0], but the set of plausible paths in q = λ[1] is empty.",
                "That is, by following plausible path λ we are bound to get to an implausible situation.",
                "But then, does it make sense to consider λ as plausible?",
                "Secondly, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P , which we call plausible satisfaction.",
                "Let M be a CTLKP 3 That is, when planning to open an industrial plant in the UK, we will probably consider the possibility of our main contractor taking her life, but we will still not take into account the possibilities of: an invasion of UFO, England being destroyed by a meteorite, Fidel Castro becoming the British Prime Minister etc.",
                "Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case, they also have a very small influence on our final decision, but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options. model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M (not necessarily any ΥM a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only.",

                "Now, the semantics of CTLKP can be given through the following clauses: M, q |=P p iff q ∈ π(p); M, q |=P ¬ϕ iff M, q |=P ϕ; M, q |=P ϕ ∧ ψ iff M, q |=P ϕ and M, q |=P ψ; M, q |=P E fϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[1] |=P ϕ; M, q |=P E2 ϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[i] |=P ϕ for every i ≥ 0; M, q |=P EϕU ψ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P and i ≥ 0 such that M, λ[i] |=P ψ, and M, λ[j] |=P ϕ for every 0 ≤ j < i; M, q |=P Pl aϕ iff M, q |=Υa ϕ; M, q |=P Ph ϕ iff M, q |= ϕ; M, q |=P Kaϕ iff M, q |= ϕ for every q such that q ∼a q ; M, q |=P Baϕ iff for all q ∈ on(Υa) with q ∼a q , we have that M, q |=Υa ϕ.",
                "One of the main reasons for using the concept of plausibility is that we want to define agents beliefs out of more primitive concepts - in our case, these are plausibility and indistinguishability - in a way analogous to [20, 7].",
                "If an agent knows that ϕ, he must be sure about it.",
                "However, beliefs of an agent are not necessarily about reliable facts.",
                "Still, they should make sense to the agent; if he believes that ϕ, then the formula should at least hold in all futures that he envisages as plausible.",

                "Ultimately, we are going to be interested in normal (not strong) validity, as parameterizing the satisfaction relation with a set P is just a technical device for propagating sets of plausible paths Υa into the semantics of nested formulae.",
                "The importance of strong validity, however, lies in the fact that |≡ ϕ ↔ ψ makes ϕ and ψ completely interchangeable, while the same is not true for normal validity.",

                "That is, we do not consider states (or possible worlds) to be more plausible than others but rather define some behaviors to be plausible, and others implausible.",

                "An actual notion of plausibility (that is, a particular set of plausible paths) can emerge in many different ways.",
                "It may result from observations and learning; an agent can learn from its observations and see specific patterns of events as plausible (a lot of people wear black shoes if they wear a suit).",
                "Knowledge exchange is another possibility (e.g., an agent a can tell agent b that player c always bluffs when he is smiling).",
                "Game theory, with its rationality criteria (undominated strategies, maxmin, Nash equilibrium etc.) is another viable source of plausibility assumptions.",
                "Last but not least, folk knowledge can be used to establish plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior (players normally want to win a game, people want to live).",
                "In any case, restricting the reasoning to plausible possibilities can be essential if we want to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all possibilities (we call them physical possibilities in the rest of the paper) is exceedingly large in real life.",

                "Now, it is possible to make statements that refer to plausible paths only, as well as statements that regard all paths that may occur in the system. 3.2 CTLK with Plausibility In this section, we extend the logic of CTLK with plausibility; we call the resulting logic CTLKP.",

                "If we want to make it clear that Υa is taken from model M, we will write ΥM a .",
                "It seems worth emphasizing that this notion of plausibility is subjective and holistic.",
                "It is subjective because Υa represents agent as subjective view on what is plausible - and indeed, different agents may have different ideas on plausibility (i.e., Υa may differ from Υb).",
                "It is holistic because Υa represents agent as idea of the plausible behavior of the whole system (including the behavior of other agents).",
                "Remark 1.",
                "In our models, plausibility is also global, i.e., plausibility sets do not depend on the state of the system.",
                "Investigating systems, in which plausibility is relativized with respect to states (like in [7]), might be an interesting avenue of future work.",
                "However, such an approach - while obviously more flexible - allows for potentially counterintuitive system descriptions.",
                "For example, it might be the case that path λ is plausible in q = λ[0], but the set of plausible paths in q = λ[1] is empty.",

                "But then, does it make sense to consider λ as plausible?",
                "Secondly, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P , which we call plausible satisfaction.",
                "Let M be a CTLKP 3 That is, when planning to open an industrial plant in the UK, we will probably consider the possibility of our main contractor taking her life, but we will still not take into account the possibilities of: an invasion of UFO, England being destroyed by a meteorite, Fidel Castro becoming the British Prime Minister etc.",
                "Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case, they also have a very small influence on our final decision, but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options. model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M (not necessarily any ΥM a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only.",

                "Finally, we discuss related work [7, 8, 20, 18, 16], and compare it with our approach. 3.1 The Concept of Plausibility It is well known how knowledge (or beliefs) can be modeled with Kripke structures.",
                "However, it is not so obvious how we can capture knowledge and beliefs in a sensible way in one framework.",
                "Clearly, there should be a connection between these two notions.",
                "Our approach is to use the notion of plausibility for this purpose.",
                "Plausibility can serve as a primitive concept that helps to define the <br>semantics</br> of beliefs, in a similar way as indistinguishability of states (represented by relation ∼a) is the semantic concept that underlies knowledge.",
                "In this sense, our work follows [7, 20]: essentially, beliefs are what an agent would know if he took only plausible options into account.",
                "In our approach, however, plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property.",
                "That is, we do not consider states (or possible worlds) to be more plausible than others but rather define some behaviors to be plausible, and others implausible.",
                "Moreover, behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the Kripke structure modeling a multi-agent system.",
                "An actual notion of plausibility (that is, a particular set of plausible paths) can emerge in many different ways.",
                "It may result from observations and learning; an agent can learn from its observations and see specific patterns of events as plausible (a lot of people wear black shoes if they wear a suit).",
                "Knowledge exchange is another possibility (e.g., an agent a can tell agent b that player c always bluffs when he is smiling).",
                "Game theory, with its rationality criteria (undominated strategies, maxmin, Nash equilibrium etc.) is another viable source of plausibility assumptions.",
                "Last but not least, folk knowledge can be used to establish plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior (players normally want to win a game, people want to live).",
                "In any case, restricting the reasoning to plausible possibilities can be essential if we want to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all possibilities (we call them physical possibilities in the rest of the paper) is exceedingly large in real life.",
                "Of course, this does not exclude a more extensive analysis in special cases, e.g. when our plausibility assumptions do not seem accurate any more, or when the cost of The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 583 inaccurate assumptions can be too high (as in the case of high-budget business decisions).",
                "But even in these cases, we usually do not get rid of plausibility assumptions completely - we only revise them to make them more cautious.3 To formalize this idea, we extend models of CTLK with sets of plausible paths and add plausibility operators Pl a, physical paths operator Ph , and belief operators Ba to the language of CTLK.",
                "Now, it is possible to make statements that refer to plausible paths only, as well as statements that regard all paths that may occur in the system. 3.2 CTLK with Plausibility In this section, we extend the logic of CTLK with plausibility; we call the resulting logic CTLKP.",
                "Formally, the language of CTLKP is defined as: ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Eγ | Pl aϕ | Ph ϕ | Kaϕ | Baϕ γ ::= fϕ | 2 ϕ | ϕU ϕ.",

                "The <br>semantics</br> of CTLKP extends that of CTLK as follows.",
                "Firstly, we augment the models with sets of plausible paths.",

                "If we want to make it clear that Υa is taken from model M, we will write ΥM a .",
                "It seems worth emphasizing that this notion of plausibility is subjective and holistic.",
                "It is subjective because Υa represents agent as subjective view on what is plausible - and indeed, different agents may have different ideas on plausibility (i.e., Υa may differ from Υb).",
                "It is holistic because Υa represents agent as idea of the plausible behavior of the whole system (including the behavior of other agents).",
                "Remark 1.",
                "In our models, plausibility is also global, i.e., plausibility sets do not depend on the state of the system.",
                "Investigating systems, in which plausibility is relativized with respect to states (like in [7]), might be an interesting avenue of future work.",
                "However, such an approach - while obviously more flexible - allows for potentially counterintuitive system descriptions.",
                "For example, it might be the case that path λ is plausible in q = λ[0], but the set of plausible paths in q = λ[1] is empty.",
                "That is, by following plausible path λ we are bound to get to an implausible situation.",
                "But then, does it make sense to consider λ as plausible?",
                "Secondly, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P , which we call plausible satisfaction.",
                "Let M be a CTLKP 3 That is, when planning to open an industrial plant in the UK, we will probably consider the possibility of our main contractor taking her life, but we will still not take into account the possibilities of: an invasion of UFO, England being destroyed by a meteorite, Fidel Castro becoming the British Prime Minister etc.",
                "Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case, they also have a very small influence on our final decision, but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options. model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M (not necessarily any ΥM a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only.",

                "In our approach, however, plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property.",
                "That is, we do not consider states (or possible worlds) to be more plausible than others but rather define some behaviors to be plausible, and others implausible.",

                "An actual notion of plausibility (that is, a particular set of plausible paths) can emerge in many different ways.",
                "It may result from observations and learning; an agent can learn from its observations and see specific patterns of events as plausible (a lot of people wear black shoes if they wear a suit).",
                "Knowledge exchange is another possibility (e.g., an agent a can tell agent b that player c always bluffs when he is smiling).",
                "Game theory, with its rationality criteria (undominated strategies, maxmin, Nash equilibrium etc.) is another viable source of plausibility assumptions.",
                "Last but not least, folk knowledge can be used to establish plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior (players normally want to win a game, people want to live).",
                "In any case, restricting the reasoning to plausible possibilities can be essential if we want to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all possibilities (we call them physical possibilities in the rest of the paper) is exceedingly large in real life.",

                "But even in these cases, we usually do not get rid of plausibility assumptions completely - we only revise them to make them more cautious.3 To formalize this idea, we extend models of CTLK with sets of plausible paths and add plausibility operators Pl a, physical paths operator Ph , and belief operators Ba to the language of CTLK.",
                "Now, it is possible to make statements that refer to plausible paths only, as well as statements that regard all paths that may occur in the system. 3.2 CTLK with Plausibility In this section, we extend the logic of CTLK with plausibility; we call the resulting logic CTLKP.",
                "Formally, the language of CTLKP is defined as: ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Eγ | Pl aϕ | Ph ϕ | Kaϕ | Baϕ γ ::= fϕ | 2 ϕ | ϕU ϕ.",

                "If we want to make it clear that Υa is taken from model M, we will write ΥM a .",
                "It seems worth emphasizing that this notion of plausibility is subjective and holistic.",
                "It is subjective because Υa represents agent as subjective view on what is plausible - and indeed, different agents may have different ideas on plausibility (i.e., Υa may differ from Υb).",
                "It is holistic because Υa represents agent as idea of the plausible behavior of the whole system (including the behavior of other agents).",
                "Remark 1.",
                "In our models, plausibility is also global, i.e., plausibility sets do not depend on the state of the system.",
                "Investigating systems, in which plausibility is relativized with respect to states (like in [7]), might be an interesting avenue of future work.",
                "However, such an approach - while obviously more flexible - allows for potentially counterintuitive system descriptions.",
                "For example, it might be the case that path λ is plausible in q = λ[0], but the set of plausible paths in q = λ[1] is empty.",
                "That is, by following plausible path λ we are bound to get to an implausible situation.",
                "But then, does it make sense to consider λ as plausible?",
                "Secondly, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P , which we call plausible satisfaction.",
                "Let M be a CTLKP 3 That is, when planning to open an industrial plant in the UK, we will probably consider the possibility of our main contractor taking her life, but we will still not take into account the possibilities of: an invasion of UFO, England being destroyed by a meteorite, Fidel Castro becoming the British Prime Minister etc.",
                "Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case, they also have a very small influence on our final decision, but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options. model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M (not necessarily any ΥM a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only.",

                "Now, the semantics of CTLKP can be given through the following clauses: M, q |=P p iff q ∈ π(p); M, q |=P ¬ϕ iff M, q |=P ϕ; M, q |=P ϕ ∧ ψ iff M, q |=P ϕ and M, q |=P ψ; M, q |=P E fϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[1] |=P ϕ; M, q |=P E2 ϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that M, λ[i] |=P ϕ for every i ≥ 0; M, q |=P EϕU ψ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P and i ≥ 0 such that M, λ[i] |=P ψ, and M, λ[j] |=P ϕ for every 0 ≤ j < i; M, q |=P Pl aϕ iff M, q |=Υa ϕ; M, q |=P Ph ϕ iff M, q |= ϕ; M, q |=P Kaϕ iff M, q |= ϕ for every q such that q ∼a q ; M, q |=P Baϕ iff for all q ∈ on(Υa) with q ∼a q , we have that M, q |=Υa ϕ.",
                "One of the main reasons for using the concept of plausibility is that we want to define agents beliefs out of more primitive concepts - in our case, these are plausibility and indistinguishability - in a way analogous to [20, 7].",
                "If an agent knows that ϕ, he must be sure about it.",
                "However, beliefs of an agent are not necessarily about reliable facts.",

                "The importance of strong validity, however, lies in the fact that |≡ ϕ ↔ ψ makes ϕ and ψ completely interchangeable, while the same is not true for normal validity.",

                "Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case, they also have a very small influence on our final decision, but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options. model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M (not necessarily any ΥM a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only.",
