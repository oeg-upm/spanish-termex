Many dissemination schemes have been proposed but most of them push data to wireless channels for general consumption. Push based broadcast [1] is essentially asymmetric, i.e., the volume of data being higher from the server to the users than from the users back to the server. Push based scheme requires some indexing which indicates when the data will be broadcast and its position in the broadcast. Access latency and tuning time are the two main parameters which may be used to evaluate an indexing scheme. Two of the important indexing schemes proposed earlier were tree based and the exponential indexing schemes. None of these schemes were able to address the requirements of location dependent data (LDD) which is highly desirable feature of data dissemination. In this paper, we discuss the broadcast of LDD in our project DAta in Your Space (DAYS), and propose a scheme for indexing LDD. We argue that this scheme, when applied to LDD, significantly improves performance in terms of tuning time over the above mentioned schemes. We prove our argument with the help of simulation results.

INTRODUCTION Wireless data dissemination is an economical and efficient way to make desired data available to a large number of mobile or static users. The mode of data transfer is essentially asymmetric, that is, the capacity of the transfer of data (downstream communication) from the server to the client (mobile user) is significantly larger than the client or mobile user to the server (upstream communication). The effectiveness of a data dissemination system is judged by its ability to provide user the required data at anywhere and at anytime. One of the best ways to accomplish this is through the dissemination of highly personalized Location Based Services (LBS) which allows users to access personalized location dependent data. An example would be someone using their mobile device to search for a vegetarian restaurant. The LBS application would interact with other location technology components or use the mobile users input to determine the users location and download the information about the restaurants in proximity to the user by tuning into the wireless channel which is disseminating LDD. We see a limited deployment of LBS by some service providers. But there are every indications that with time some of the complex technical problems such as uniform location framework, calculating and tracking locations in all types of places, positioning in various environments, innovative location applications, etc., will be resolved and LBS will become a common facility and will help to improve market productivity and customer comfort. In our project called DAYS, we use wireless data broadcast mechanism to push LDD to users and mobile users monitor and tune the channel to find and download the required data. A simple broadcast, however, is likely to cause significant performance degradation in the energy constrained mobile devices and a common solution to this problem is the use of efficient air indexing. The indexing approach stores control information which tells the user about the data location in the broadcast and how and when he could access it. A mobile user, thus, has some free time to go into the doze mode which conserves valuable power. It also allows the user to personalize his own mobile device by selectively tuning to the information of his choice. Access efficiency and energy conservation are the two issues which are significant for data broadcast systems. Access efficiency refers to the latency experienced when a request is initiated till the response is received. Energy conservation [7, 10] refers to the efficient use of the limited energy of the mobile device in accessing broadcast data. Two parameters that affect these are the tuning time and the access latency. Tuning time refers to the time during which the mobile unit (MU) remains in active state to tune the channel and download its required data. It can also be defined as the number of buckets tuned by the mobile device in active state to get its required data. Access latency may be defined as the time elapsed since a request has been issued till the response has been received. 1 This research was supported by a grant from NSF IIS-0209170. Several indexing schemes have been proposed in the past and the prominent among them are the tree based and the exponential indexing schemes [17]. The main disadvantages of the tree based schemes are that they are based on centralized tree structures. To start a search, the MU has to wait until it reaches the root of the next broadcast tree. This significantly affects the tuning time of the mobile unit. The exponential schemes facilitate index replication by sharing links in different search trees. For broadcasts with large number of pages, the exponential scheme has been shown to perform similarly as the tree based schemes in terms of access latency. Also, the average length of broadcast increases due to the index replication and this may cause significant increase in the access latency. None of the above indexing schemes is equally effective in broadcasting location dependent data. In addition to providing low latency, they lack properties which are used to address LDD issues. We propose an indexing scheme in DAYS which takes care of some these problems. We show with simulation results that our scheme outperforms some of the earlier indexing schemes for broadcasting LDD in terms of tuning time. The rest of the paper is presented as follows. In section 2, we discuss previous work related to indexing of broadcast data. Section 3 describes our DAYS architecture. Location dependent data, its generation and subsequent broadcast is presented in section 4. Section 5 discusses our indexing scheme in detail. Simulation of our scheme and its performance evaluation is presented in section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper and mentions future related work. 2. PREVIOUS WORK Several disk-based indexing techniques have been used for air indexing. Imielinski et al. [5, 6] applied the B+ index tree, where the leaf nodes store the arrival times of the data items. The distributed indexing method was proposed to efficiently replicate and distribute the index tree in a broadcast. Specifically, the index tree is divided into a replicated part and a non replicated part. Each broadcast consists of the replicated part and the nonreplicated part that indexes the data items immediately following it. As such, each node in the non-replicated part appears only once in a broadcast and, hence, reduces the replication cost and access latency while achieving a good tuning time. Chen et al. [2] and Shivakumar et al. [8] considered unbalanced tree structures to optimize energy consumption for non-uniform data access. These structures minimize the average index search cost by reducing the number of index searches for hot data at the expense of spending more on cold data. Tan and Yu discussed data and index organization under skewed broadcast Hashing and signature methods have also been suggested for wireless broadcast that supports equality queries [9]. A flexible indexing method was proposed in [5]. The flexible index first sorts the data items in ascending (or descending) order of the search key values and then divides them into p segments. The first bucket in each data segment contains a control index, which is a binary index mapping a given key value to the segment containing that key, and a local index, which is an m-entry index mapping a given key value to the buckets within the current segment. By tuning the parameters of p and m, mobile clients can achieve either a good tuning time or good access latency. Another indexing technique proposed is the exponential indexing scheme [17]. In this scheme, a parameterized index, called the exponential index is used to optimize the access latency or the tuning time. It facilitates index replication by linking different search trees. All of the above mentioned schemes have been applied to data which are non related to each other. These non related data may be clustered or non clustered. However, none of them has specifically addressed the requirements of LDD. Location dependent data are data which are associated with a location. Presently there are several applications that deal with LDD [13, 16]. Almost all of them depict LDD with the help of hierarchical structures [3, 4]. This is based on the containment property of location dependent data. The Containment property helps determining relative position of an object by defining or identifying locations that contains those objects. The subordinate locations are hierarchically related to each other. Thus, Containment property limits the range of availability or operation of a service. We use this containment property in our indexing scheme to index LDD. 3. DAYS ARCHITECTURE DAYS has been conceptualized to disseminate topical and nontopical data to users in a local broadcast space and to accept queries from individual users globally. Topical data, for example, weather information, traffic information, stock information, etc., constantly changes over time. Non topical data such as hotel, restaurant, real estate prices, etc., do not change so often. Thus, we envision the presence of two types of data distribution: In the first case, server pushes data to local users through wireless channels. The other case deals with the server sending results of user queries through downlink wireless channels. Technically, we see the presence of two types of queues in the pull based data access. One is a heavily loaded queue containing globally uploaded queries. The other is a comparatively lightly loaded queue consisting of locally uploaded queries. The DAYS architecture [12] as shown in figure 1 consists of a Data Server, Broadcast Scheduler, DAYS Coordinator, Network of LEO satellites for global data delivery and a Local broadcast space. Data is pushed into the local broadcast space so that users may tune into the wireless channels to access the data. The local broadcast space consists of a broadcast tower, mobile units and a network of data staging machines called the surrogates. Data staging in surrogates has been earlier investigated as a successful technique [12, 15] to cache users related data. We believe that data staging can be used to drastically reduce the latency time for both the local broadcast data as well as global responses. Query request in the surrogates may subsequently be used to generate the popularity patterns which ultimately decide the broadcast schedule [12]. 18 Popularity Feedback from Surrogates for Broadcast Scheduler Local Broadcast Space Broadcast Tower SurrogateMU MU MU MU Data ServerBroadcast schedulerDAYS Coordinator Local downlink channel Global downlink channel Pull request queue Global request queue Local request queue Location based index Starbucks Plaza Kansas City Figure 1. DAYS Architecture Figure 2. Location Structure ofStarbucks, Plaza 4. LOCATION DEPENDENT DATA (LDD) We argue that incorporating location information in wireless data broadcast can significantly decrease the access latency. This property becomes highly useful for mobile unit which has limited storage and processing capability. There are a variety of applications to obtain information about traffic, restaurant and hotel booking, fast food, gas stations, post office, grocery stores, etc. If these applications are coupled with location information, then the search will be fast and highly cost effective. An important property of the locations is Containment which helps to determine the relative location of an object with respect to its parent that contains the object. Thus, Containment limits the range of availability of a data. We use this property in our indexing scheme. The database contains the broadcast contents which are converted into LDD [14] by associating them with respective locations so that it can be broadcasted in a clustered manner. The clustering of LDD helps the user to locate information efficiently and supports containment property. We present an example to justify our proposition. Example: Suppose a user issues query Starbucks Coffee in Plaza please. to access information about the Plaza branch of Starbucks Coffee in Kansas City. In the case of location independent set up the system will list all Starbucks coffee shops in Kansas City area. It is obvious that such responses will increase access latency and are not desirable. These can be managed efficiently if the server has location dependent data, i.e., a mapping between a Starbucks coffee shop data and its physical location. Also, for a query including range of locations of Starbucks, a single query requesting locations for the entire region of Kansas City, as shown in Figure 2, will suffice. This will save enormous amount of bandwidth by decreasing the number of messages and at the same time will be helpful in preventing the scalability bottleneck in highly populated area. 4.1 Mapping Function for LDD The example justifies the need for a mapping function to process location dependent queries. This will be especially important for pull based queries across the globe for which the reply could be composed for different parts of the world. The mapping function is necessary to construct the broadcast schedule. We define Global Property Set (GPS) [11], Information Content (IC) set, and Location Hierarchy (LH) set where IC ⊆ GPS and LH ⊆ GPS to develop a mapping function. LH = {l1, l2, l3…,lk} where li represent locations in the location tree and IC = {ic1, ic2, ic3,…,icn} where ici represent information type. For example, if we have traffic, weather, and stock information are in broadcast then IC = {ictraffic, icweather, and icstock}. The mapping scheme must be able to identify and select an IC member and a LH node for (a) correct association, (b) granularity match, (c) and termination condition. For example, weather ∈ IC could be associated with a country or a state or a city or a town of LH. The granularity match between the weather and a LH node is as per user requirement. Thus, with a coarse granularity weather information is associated with a country to get countrys weather and with town in a finer granularity. If a town is the finest granularity, then it defines the terminal condition for association between IC and LH for weather. This means that a user cannot get weather information about subdivision of a town. In reality weather of a subdivision does not make any sense. We develop a simple heuristic mapping approach scheme based on user requirement. Let IC = {m1, m2,m3 .,..., mk}, where mi represent its element and let LH = {n1, n2, n3, ..., nl}, where ni represents LHs member. We define GPS for IC (GPSIC) ⊆ GPS and for LH (GPSLH) ⊆ GPS as GPSIC = {P1, P2,…, Pn}, where P1, P2, P3,…, Pn are properties of its members and GPSLH = {Q1, Q2,…, Qm} where Q1, Q2,…, Qm are properties of its members. The properties of a particular member of IC are a subset of GPSIC. It is generally true that (property set (mi∈ IC) ∪ property set (mj∈ IC)) ≠ ∅, however, there may be cases where the intersection is not null. For example, stock ∈ IC and movie ∈ IC rating do not have any property in common. We assume that any two or more members of IC have at least one common geographical property (i.e. location) because DAYS broadcasts information about those categories, which are closely tied with a location. For example, stock of a company is related to a country, weather is related to a city or state, etc. We define the property subset of mi∈ IC as PSm i ∀ mi ∈ IC and PSm i = {P1, P2, ..., Pr} where r ≤ n. ∀ Pr {Pr ∈ PSm i → Pr∈ GPSIC} which implies that ∀ i, PSm i ⊆ GPSIC. The geographical properties of this set are indicative of whether mi ∈ IC can be mapped to only a single granularity level (i.e. a single location) in LH or a multiple granularity levels (i.e. more than one nodes in 19 the hierarchy) in LH. How many and which granularity levels should a mi map to, depends upon the level at which the service provider wants to provide information about the mi in question. Similarly we define a property subset of LH members as PSn j ∀ nj ∈ LH which can be written as PSn j ={Q1, Q2, Q3, …, Qs} where s ≤ m. In addition, ∀ Qs {Qs∈ PSn j → Qs∈ GPSLH} which implies that ∀j, PSn j ⊆ GPSLH. The process of mapping from IC to LH is then identifying for some mx∈ IC one or more ny∈ LH such that PSmx ∩ PSnv ≠ φ. This means that when mx maps to ny and all children of ny if mx can map to multiple granularity levels or mx maps only to ny if mx can map to a single granularity level. We assume that new members can join and old member can leave IC or LH any time. The deletion of members from the IC space is simple but addition of members to the IC space is more restrictive. If we want to add a new member to the IC space, then we first define a property set for the new member: PSmnew_m ={P1, P2, P3, …, Pt} and add it to the IC only if the condition:∀ Pw {Pw∈ PSpnew_m → Pw∈ GPSIC} is satisfied. This scheme has an additional benefit of allowing the information service providers to have a control over what kind of information they wish to provide to the users. We present the following example to illustrate the mapping concept. IC = {Traffic, Stock, Restaurant, Weather, Important history dates, Road conditions} LH = {Country, State, City, Zip-code, Major-roads} GPSIC = {Surface-mobility, Roads, High, Low, Italian-food, StateName, Temp, CityName, Seat-availability, Zip, Traffic-jams, Stock-price, CountryName, MajorRoadName, Wars, Discoveries, World} GPSLH = {Country, CountrySize, StateName, CityName, Zip, MajorRoadName} Ps(ICStock) = {Stock-price, CountryName, High, Low} Ps(ICTraffic) = {Surface-mobility, Roads, High, Low, Traffic-jams, CityName} Ps(ICImportant dates in history) = {World, Wars, Discoveries} Ps(ICRoad conditions) = {Precipitation, StateName, CityName} Ps(ICRestaurant) = {Italian-food, Zip code} Ps(ICWeather) = {StateName, CityName, Precipitation, Temperature} PS(LHCountry) = {CountryName, CountrySize} PS(LHState = {StateName, State size}, PS(LHCity) ={CityName, City size} PS(LHZipcode) = {ZipCodeNum } PS(LHMajor roads) = {MajorRoadName} Now, only PS(ICStock) ∩ PSCountry ≠φ. In addition, PS(ICStock) indicated that Stock can map to only a single location Country. When we consider the member Traffic of IC space, only PS(ICTraffic) ∩ PScity ≠ φ. As PS(ICTraffic) indicates that Traffic can map to only a single location, it maps only to City and none of its children. Now unlike Stock, mapping of Traffic with Major roads, which is a child of City, is meaningful. However service providers have right to control the granularity levels at which they want to provide information about a member of IC space. PS(ICRoad conditions) ∩ PSState ≠φ and PS(ICRoad conditions) ∩ PSCity≠φ. So Road conditions maps to State as well as City. As PS(ICRoad conditions) indicates that Road conditions can map to multiple granularity levels, Road conditions will also map to Zip Code and Major roads, which are the children of State and City. Similarly, Restaurant maps only to Zip code, and Weather maps to State, City and their children, Major Roads and Zip Code. 5. LOCATION BASED INDEXING SCHEME This section discusses our location based indexing scheme (LBIS). The scheme is designed to conform to the LDD broadcast in our project DAYS. As discussed earlier, we use the containment property of LDD in the indexing scheme. This significantly limits the search of our required data to a particular portion of broadcast. Thus, we argue that the scheme provides bounded tuning time. We describe the architecture of our indexing scheme. Our scheme contains separate data buckets and index buckets. The index buckets are of two types. The first type is called the Major index. The Major index provides information about the types of data broadcasted. For example, if we intend to broadcast information like Entertainment, Weather, Traffic etc., then the major index points to either these major types of information and/or their main subtypes of information, the number of main subtypes varying from one information to another. This strictly limits number of accesses to a Major index. The Major index never points to the original data. It points to the sub indexes called the Minor index. The minor indexes are the indexes which actually points to the original data. We called these minor index pointers as Location Pointers as they points to the data which are associated with a location. Thus, our search for a data includes accessing of a major index and some minor indexes, the number of minor index varying depending on the type of information. Thus, our indexing scheme takes into account the hierarchical nature of the LDD, the Containment property, and requires our broadcast schedule to be clustered based on data type and location. The structure of the location hierarchy requires the use of different types of index at different levels. The structure and positions of index strictly depend on the location hierarchy as described in our mapping scheme earlier. We illustrate the implementation of our scheme with an example. The rules for framing the index are mentioned subsequently. 20 A1 Entertainment Resturant Movie A2 A3 A4 R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 Weather KC SL JC SF Entertainment R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 KC SL JC SF (A, R, NEXT = 8) 3, R5 4, R7 Type (S, L) ER W E EM (1, 4) (5, 4) (1, 4), (9, 4) (9, 4) Type (S, L) W E EM ER (1, 4) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 4) Type (S, L) E EM ER W (1, 8) (1, 4) (5, 4) (9, 4) A1 A2 A3 A4 Movie Resturant Weather 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Major index Major index Major index Minor index Major index Minor index Figure 3. Location Mapped Information for Broadcast Figure 4. Data coupled with Location based Index Example: Let us suppose that our broadcast content contains ICentertainment and ICweather which is represented as shown in Fig. 3. Ai represents Areas of City and Ri represents roads in a certain area. The leaves of Weather structure represent four cities. The index structure is given in Fig. 4 which shows the position of major and minor index and data in the broadcast schedule. We propose the following rules for the creation of the air indexed broadcast schedule: • The major index and the minor index are created. • The major index contains the position and range of different types of data items (Weather and Entertainment, Figure 3) and their categories. The sub categories of Entertainment, Movie and Restaurant, are also in the index. Thus, the major index contains Entertainment (E), Entertainment-Movie (EM), Entertainment-Restaurant (ER), and Weather (W). The tuple (S, L) represents the starting position (S) of the data item and L represents the range of the item in terms of number of data buckets. • The minor index contains the variables A, R and a pointer Next. In our example (Figure 3), road R represents the first node of area A. The minor index is used to point to actual data buckets present at the lowest levels of the hierarchy. In contrast, the major index points to a broader range of locations and so it contains information about main and sub categories of data. • Index information is not incorporated in the data buckets. Index buckets are separate containing only the control information. • The number of major index buckets m=#(IC), IC = {ic1, ic2, ic3,…,icn} where ici represent information type and # represents the cardinality of the Information Content set IC. In this example, IC= {icMovie, icWeather, icRestaurant} and so #(IC) =3. Hence, the number of major index buckets is 3. • Mechanism to resolve the query is present in the java based coordinator in MU. For example, if a query Q is presented as Q (Entertainment, Movie, Road_1), then the resultant search will be for the EM information in the major index. We say, Q EM. Our proposed index works as follows: Let us suppose that an MU issues a query which is represented by Java Coordinator present in the MU as Restaurant information on Road 7. This is resolved by the coordinator as Q ER. This means one has to search for ER unit of index in the major index. Let us suppose that the MU logs into the channel at R2. The first index it receives is a minor index after R2. In this index, value of Next variable = 4, which means that the next major index is present after bucket 4. The MU may go into doze mode. It becomes active after bucket 4 and receives the major index. It searches for ER information which is the first entry in this index. It is now certain that the MU will get the position of the data bucket in the adjoining minor index. The second unit in the minor index depicts the position of the required data R7. It tells that the data bucket is the first bucket in Area 4. The MU goes into doze mode again and becomes active after bucket 6. It gets the required data in the next bucket. We present the algorithm for searching the location based Index. Algorithm 1 Location based Index Search in DAYS 1. Scan broadcast for the next index bucket, found=false 2. While (not found) do 3. if bucket is Major Index then 4. Find the Type & Tuple (S, L) 5. if S is greater than 1, go into doze mode for S seconds 6. end if 7.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION Conservation of energy is the main concern when we try to access data from wireless broadcast. An efficient scheme should allow the mobile device to access its required data by staying active for a minimum amount of time. This would save considerable amount of energy. Since items are distributed based on types and are mapped to suitable locations, we argue that our broadcast deals with clustered data types. The mobile unit has to access a larger major index and a relatively much smaller minor index to get information about the time of arrival of data. This is in contrast to the exponential scheme where the indexes are of equal sizes. The example discussed and Algorithm 1 reveals that to access any data, we need to access the major index only once followed by one or more accesses to the minor index. The number of minor index access depends on the number of internal locations. As the number of internal locations vary for item to item (for example, Weather is generally associated with a City whereas traffic is granulated up to major and minor roads of a city), we argue that the structure of the location mapped information may be visualized as a forest which is a collection of general trees, the number of general trees depending on the types of information broadcasted and depth of a tree depending on the granularity of the location information associated with the information. For our experiments, we assume the forest as a collection of balanced M-ary trees. We further assume the M-ary trees to be full by assuming the presence of dummy nodes in different levels of a tree. Thus, if the number of data items is d and the height of the tree is m, then n= (m*d-1)/(m-1) where n is the number of vertices in the tree and i= (d-1)/(m-1) where i is the number of internal vertices. Tuning time for a data item involves 1 unit of time required to access the major index plus time required to access the data items present in the leaves of the tree. Thus, tuning time with d data items is t = logmd+1 We can say that tuning time is bounded by O(logmd). We compare our scheme with the distributed indexing and exponential scheme. We assume a flat broadcast and number of pages varying from 5000 to 25000. The various simulation parameters are shown in Table 1. Figure 5-8 shows the relative tuning times of three indexing algorithms, ie, the LBIS, exponential scheme and the distributed tree scheme. Figure 5 shows the result for number of internal location nodes = 3. We can see that LBIS significantly outperforms both the other schemes. The tuning time in LBIS ranges from approx 6.8 to 8. This large tuning time is due to the fact that after reaching the lowest minor index, the MU may have to access few buckets sequentially to get the required data bucket. We can see that the tuning time tends to become stable as the length of broadcast increases. In figure 6 we consider m= 4. Here we can see that the exponential and the distributed perform almost similarly, though the former seems to perform slightly better as the broadcast length increases. A very interesting pattern is visible in figure 7. For smaller broadcast size, the LBIS seems to have larger tuning time than the other two schemes. But as the length of broadcast increases, it is clearly visible the LBIS outperforms the other two schemes. The Distributed tree indexing shows similar behavior like the LBIS. The tuning time in LBIS remains low because the algorithm allows the MU to skip some intermediate Minor Indexes. This allows the MU to move into lower levels directly after coming into active mode, thus saving valuable energy. This action is not possible in the distributed tree indexing and hence we can observe that its tuning time is more than the LBIS scheme, although it performs better than the exponential scheme. Figure 8, in contrast, shows us that the tuning time in LBIS, though less than the other two schemes, tends to increase sharply as the broadcast length becomes greater than the 15000 pages. This may be attributed both due to increase in time required to scan the intermediate Minor Indexes and the length of the broadcast. But we can observe that the slope of the LBIS curve is significantly less than the other two curves. Table 1 Simulation Parameters P Definition Values N Number of data Items 5000 - 25000 m Number of internal location nodes 3, 4, 5, 6 B Capacity of bucket without index (for exponential index) 10,64,128,256 i Index base for exponential index 2,4,6,8 k Index size for distributed tree 8 bytes The simulation results establish some facts about our location based indexing scheme. The scheme performs better than the other two schemes in terms of tuning time in most of the cases. As the length of the broadcast increases, after a certain point, though the tuning time increases as a result of factors which we have described before, the scheme always performs better than the other two schemes. Due to the prescribed limit of the number of pages in the paper, we are unable to show more results. But these omitted results show similar trend as the results depicted in figure 5-8. 7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have presented a scheme for mapping of wireless broadcast data with their locations. We have presented an example to show how the hierarchical structure of the location tree maps with the data to create LDD. We have presented a scheme called LBIS to index this LDD. We have used the containment property of LDD in the scheme that limits the search to a narrow range of data in the broadcast, thus saving valuable energy in the device. The mapping of data with locations and the indexing scheme will be used in our DAYS project to create the push based architecture. The LBIS has been compared with two other prominent indexing schemes, i.e., the distributed tree indexing scheme and the exponential indexing scheme. We showed in our simulations that the LBIS scheme has the lowest tuning time for broadcasts having large number of pages, thus saving valuable battery power in the MU. 22 In the future work we try to incorporate pull based architecture in our DAYS project. Data from the server is available for access by the global users. This may be done by putting a request to the source server. The query in this case is a global query. It is transferred from the users source server to the destination server through the use of LEO satellites. We intend to use our LDD scheme and data staging architecture in the pull based architecture. We will show that the LDD scheme together with the data staging architecture significantly improves the latency for global as well as local query. 8. REFERENCES [1] Acharya, S., Alonso, R.

Se han propuesto muchos esquemas de difusión, pero la mayoría de ellos empujan datos a canales inalámbricos para el consumo general. La transmisión basada en Push [1] es esencialmente asimétrica, es decir, el volumen de datos es más alto del servidor a los usuarios que de los usuarios de regreso al servidor. El esquema basado en push requiere alguna indexación que indique cuándo se transmitirán los datos y su posición en la transmisión. La latencia de acceso y el tiempo de ajuste son los dos parámetros principales que pueden usarse para evaluar un esquema de indexación. Dos de los esquemas de indexación importantes propuestos anteriormente fueron basados en árboles y los esquemas de indexación exponencial. Ninguno de estos esquemas pudo abordar los requisitos de los datos dependientes de la ubicación (LDD), que es una característica altamente deseable de la difusión de datos. En este documento, discutimos la transmisión de LDD en los datos de nuestro proyecto en su espacio (días), y proponemos un esquema para indexar LDD. Argumentamos que este esquema, cuando se aplica a LDD, mejora significativamente el rendimiento en términos de tiempo de ajuste sobre los esquemas mencionados anteriormente. Probamos nuestro argumento con la ayuda de los resultados de la simulación.

Introducción La diseminación de datos inalámbricos es una forma económica y eficiente de poner a disposición de los datos deseados a una gran cantidad de usuarios móviles o estáticos. El modo de transferencia de datos es esencialmente asimétrico, es decir, la capacidad de la transferencia de datos (comunicación aguas abajo) del servidor al cliente (usuario móvil) es significativamente mayor que el cliente o usuario móvil al servidor (comunicación aguas arriba). La efectividad de un sistema de difusión de datos se juzga por su capacidad de proporcionar a los datos del usuario en cualquier lugar y en cualquier momento. Una de las mejores maneras de lograr esto es a través de la difusión de servicios (LBS) altamente personalizados que permite a los usuarios acceder a datos dependientes de ubicación personalizada. Un ejemplo sería alguien que use su dispositivo móvil para buscar un restaurante vegetariano. La aplicación LBS interactuaría con otros componentes de tecnología de ubicación o utilizaría la entrada de usuarios móviles para determinar la ubicación de los usuarios y descargar la información sobre los restaurantes cerca del usuario sintonizando el canal inalámbrico que está difundiendo LDD. Vemos una implementación limitada de LB por algunos proveedores de servicios. Pero existen todas las indicaciones de que con el tiempo algunos de los problemas técnicos complejos, como el marco de ubicación uniforme, el cálculo y las ubicaciones de seguimiento en todo tipo de lugares, posicionan en varios entornos, aplicaciones innovadoras de ubicación, etc., se resolverán y LB se convertirá en unInstalación común y ayudará a mejorar la productividad del mercado y la comodidad del cliente. En nuestro proyecto llamado Days, utilizamos el mecanismo de transmisión de datos inalámbricos para impulsar el LDD a los usuarios y los usuarios móviles monitorean y sintonizan el canal para encontrar y descargar los datos requeridos. Sin embargo, es probable que una transmisión simple cause una degradación significativa del rendimiento en los dispositivos móviles limitados de energía y una solución común a este problema es el uso de la indexación de aire eficiente. El enfoque de indexación almacena información de control que le indica al usuario sobre la ubicación de los datos en la transmisión y cómo y cuándo podría acceder a ella. Un usuario móvil, por lo tanto, tiene algo de tiempo libre para entrar en el modo Doze que conserva la valiosa potencia. También permite al usuario personalizar su propio dispositivo móvil sintonizando selectivamente la información de su elección. La eficiencia de acceso y la conservación de la energía son los dos problemas que son significativos para los sistemas de transmisión de datos. La eficiencia de acceso se refiere a la latencia experimentada cuando se inicia una solicitud hasta que se recibe la respuesta. La conservación de energía [7, 10] se refiere al uso eficiente de la energía limitada del dispositivo móvil para acceder a los datos de transmisión. Dos parámetros que afectan estos son el tiempo de ajuste y la latencia de acceso. El tiempo de ajuste se refiere al tiempo durante el cual la unidad móvil (MU) permanece en estado activo para ajustar el canal y descargar sus datos requeridos. También se puede definir como el número de cubos ajustados por el dispositivo móvil en estado activo para obtener sus datos requeridos. La latencia de acceso puede definirse como el tiempo transcurrido desde que se ha emitido una solicitud hasta que se haya recibido la respuesta.1 Esta investigación fue apoyada por una subvención de NSF IIS-0209170. Se han propuesto varios esquemas de indexación en el pasado y los prominentes entre ellos están basados en árboles y los esquemas de indexación exponencial [17]. Las principales desventajas de los esquemas a base de árboles son que se basan en estructuras de árbol centralizadas. Para comenzar una búsqueda, el MU tiene que esperar hasta llegar a la raíz del próximo árbol de transmisión. Esto afecta significativamente el tiempo de ajuste de la unidad móvil. Los esquemas exponenciales facilitan la replicación del índice al compartir enlaces en diferentes árboles de búsqueda. Para las transmisiones con una gran cantidad de páginas, se ha demostrado que el esquema exponencial funciona de manera similar a los esquemas basados en árboles en términos de latencia de acceso. Además, la duración promedio de la transmisión aumenta debido a la replicación del índice y esto puede causar un aumento significativo en la latencia de acceso. Ninguno de los esquemas de indexación anteriores es igualmente efectivo en los datos dependientes de la ubicación de transmisión. Además de proporcionar baja latencia, carecen de propiedades que se utilizan para abordar los problemas de LDD. Proponemos un esquema de indexación en días que se encarga de algunos de estos problemas. Mostramos con los resultados de la simulación que nuestro esquema supera a algunos de los esquemas de indexación anteriores para transmitir LDD en términos de tiempo de ajuste. El resto del documento se presenta de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, discutimos los trabajos anteriores relacionados con la indexación de datos de transmisión. La Sección 3 describe nuestros días arquitectura. Los datos dependientes de la ubicación, su generación y la transmisión posterior se presentan en la Sección 4. La Sección 5 analiza nuestro esquema de indexación en detalle. La simulación de nuestro esquema y su evaluación de rendimiento se presenta en la Sección 6. La Sección 7 concluye el documento y menciona un trabajo relacionado con el futuro.2. Trabajo anterior Se han utilizado varias técnicas de indexación basadas en disco para la indexación de aire. Imielinski et al.[5, 6] aplicó el árbol de índice B+, donde los nodos de la hoja almacenan los tiempos de llegada de los elementos de datos. Se propuso el método de indexación distribuido para replicar y distribuir eficientemente el árbol de índice en una transmisión. Específicamente, el árbol índice se divide en una parte replicada y una parte no replicada. Cada transmisión consta de la parte replicada y la parte no replicada que indexa los elementos de datos inmediatamente siguientes. Como tal, cada nodo en la parte no replicada aparece solo una vez en una transmisión y, por lo tanto, reduce el costo de replicación y la latencia de acceso mientras logra un buen tiempo de ajuste. Chen et al.[2] y Shivakumar et al.[8] consideraron estructuras de árboles desequilibradas para optimizar el consumo de energía para el acceso a datos no uniformes. Estas estructuras minimizan el costo promedio de búsqueda de índice al reducir el número de búsquedas de índice de datos calientes a expensas de gastar más en datos de frío. Tan y Yu discutieron la organización de datos e índices bajo el hash de transmisión sesgados y los métodos de firma también se han sugerido para la transmisión inalámbrica que admite consultas de igualdad [9]. Se propuso un método de indexación flexible en [5]. El índice flexible primero clasifica los elementos de datos en el orden ascendente (o descendente) de los valores de la clave de búsqueda y luego los divide en segmentos P. El primer cubo en cada segmento de datos contiene un índice de control, que es un índice binario que asigna un valor de clave dado para el segmento que contiene esa clave, y un índice local, que es un índice de entrada M, asigna un valor clave dado a los cubos dentroel segmento actual. Al ajustar los parámetros de P y M, los clientes móviles pueden lograr un buen tiempo de ajuste o una buena latencia de acceso. Otra técnica de indexación propuesta es el esquema de indexación exponencial [17]. En este esquema, se utiliza un índice parametrizado, llamado índice exponencial para optimizar la latencia de acceso o el tiempo de ajuste. Facilita la replicación del índice al vincular diferentes árboles de búsqueda. Todos los esquemas mencionados anteriormente se han aplicado a datos que no están relacionados entre sí. Estos datos no relacionados pueden agruparse o no agruparse. Sin embargo, ninguno de ellos ha abordado específicamente los requisitos de LDD. Los datos dependientes de la ubicación son datos asociados con una ubicación. Actualmente hay varias aplicaciones que tratan con LDD [13, 16]. Casi todos representan LDD con la ayuda de estructuras jerárquicas [3, 4]. Esto se basa en la propiedad de contención de los datos dependientes de la ubicación. La propiedad de contención ayuda a determinar la posición relativa de un objeto definiendo o identificando ubicaciones que contienen esos objetos. Las ubicaciones subordinadas están jerárquicamente relacionadas entre sí. Por lo tanto, la propiedad de contención limita el rango de disponibilidad u operación de un servicio. Utilizamos esta propiedad de contención en nuestro esquema de indexación para indexar LDD.3. Days Architecture Days ha sido conceptualizado para difundir datos tópicos y no tópicos a los usuarios en un espacio de transmisión local y aceptar consultas de usuarios individuales a nivel mundial. Los datos tópicos, por ejemplo, información meteorológica, información de tráfico, información sobre acciones, etc., cambian constantemente con el tiempo. Los datos no tópicos, como hotel, restaurante, precios de bienes raíces, etc., no cambian con tanta frecuencia. Por lo tanto, imaginamos la presencia de dos tipos de distribución de datos: en el primer caso, el servidor empuja los datos a los usuarios locales a través de canales inalámbricos. El otro caso se ocupa del servidor que envía resultados de consultas de usuarios a través de canales inalámbricos de enlace descendente. Técnicamente, vemos la presencia de dos tipos de colas en el acceso a datos basados en extracción. Una es una cola muy cargada que contiene consultas cargadas globalmente. El otro es una cola relativamente ligeramente cargada que consiste en consultas cargadas localmente. La arquitectura de los días [12] como se muestra en la Figura 1 consiste en un servidor de datos, un programador de transmisión, coordinador de días, red de satélites LEO para la entrega de datos globales y un espacio de transmisión local. Los datos se empujan al espacio de transmisión local para que los usuarios puedan sintonizar los canales inalámbricos para acceder a los datos. El espacio de transmisión local consiste en una torre de transmisión, unidades móviles y una red de máquinas de estadificación de datos llamadas sustitutos. La puesta en escena de datos en sustitutos se ha investigado anteriormente como una técnica exitosa [12, 15] a los datos relacionados con los usuarios de caché. Creemos que la estadificación de datos puede usarse para reducir drásticamente el tiempo de latencia tanto para los datos de transmisión locales como para las respuestas globales. La solicitud de consulta en los sustitutos puede usarse posteriormente para generar los patrones de popularidad que finalmente deciden el horario de transmisión [12].18 Comentarios de popularidad de los sustitutos para el programador de transmisión de transmisión local de transmisión de transmisión Torre de transmisión Subrogatemu Mu Mu Servidor de datos Broadcast Coordinator Coordinator Local Downlink Channel Global Downink Channel Strish Solicitud de requisitos Global Solicitud Global Solicitud Local Solicitud de cola Ubicación basada en el índice Starbucks Plaza Kansas City Figura 1. Arquitectura de días Figura 2. Estructura de ubicación de Estturbucks, Plaza 4. Datos dependientes de la ubicación (LDD) Argumentamos que incorporar información de ubicación en la transmisión de datos inalámbricos puede disminuir significativamente la latencia de acceso. Esta propiedad se vuelve muy útil para la unidad móvil que tiene una capacidad limitada de almacenamiento y procesamiento. Hay una variedad de aplicaciones para obtener información sobre el tráfico, la reserva de restaurantes y hoteles, comida rápida, estaciones de servicio, oficina de correos, supermercados, etc. Si estas aplicaciones se combinan con la información de ubicación, la búsqueda será rápida y altamente rentable. Una propiedad importante de las ubicaciones es la contención que ayuda a determinar la ubicación relativa de un objeto con respecto a su padre que contiene el objeto. Por lo tanto, la contención limita el rango de disponibilidad de un datos. Utilizamos esta propiedad en nuestro esquema de indexación. La base de datos contiene el contenido de transmisión que se convierten en LDD [14] al asociarlos con ubicaciones respectivas para que pueda transmitirse de manera agrupada. La agrupación de LDD ayuda al usuario a localizar información de manera eficiente y admite la propiedad de contención. Presentamos un ejemplo para justificar nuestra proposición. Ejemplo: Suponga que un usuario emite consulta Starbucks Coffee en Plaza, por favor.Para acceder a la información sobre la sucursal de Plaza de Starbucks Coffee en Kansas City. En el caso de la ubicación, la configuración independiente, el sistema enumerará todas las cafeterías de Starbucks en el área de Kansas City. Es obvio que tales respuestas aumentarán la latencia de acceso y no son deseables. Estos se pueden administrar de manera eficiente si el servidor tiene datos dependientes de la ubicación, es decir, una asignación entre los datos de una cafetería Starbucks y su ubicación física. Además, para una consulta que incluye la gama de ubicaciones de Starbucks, será suficiente una sola consulta que solicite ubicaciones para toda la región de Kansas City, como se muestra en la Figura 2. Esto ahorrará una enorme cantidad de ancho de banda al disminuir la cantidad de mensajes y al mismo tiempo será útil para prevenir el cuello de botella de escalabilidad en un área altamente poblada.4.1 Función de mapeo para LDD El ejemplo justifica la necesidad de una función de mapeo para procesar consultas dependientes de la ubicación. Esto será especialmente importante para consultas basadas en tirones en todo el mundo para las cuales la respuesta podría estar compuesta para diferentes partes del mundo. La función de mapeo es necesaria para construir el horario de transmisión. Definimos el conjunto de propiedades globales (GPS) [11], el conjunto de contenido de información (IC) y la jerarquía de ubicación (LH) establecida donde IC ⊆ GPS y LH ⊆ GPS para desarrollar una función de mapeo. Lh = {l1, l2, l3 ..., lk} donde Li representa ubicaciones en el árbol de ubicación e IC = {ic1, ic2, ic3, ..., icn} donde ICI representa el tipo de información. Por ejemplo, si tenemos información de tráfico, clima y acciones se transmiten, entonces ic = {ictraffic, icweather e icstock}. El esquema de mapeo debe poder identificar y seleccionar un miembro IC y un nodo LH para (a) asociación correcta, (b) coincidencia de granularidad, (c) y condición de terminación. Por ejemplo, el clima ∈ Ic podría estar asociado con un país o un estado o una ciudad o una ciudad de LH. La coincidencia de granularidad entre el clima y un nodo LH es según los requisitos del usuario. Por lo tanto, con una información climática de granularidad gruesa se asocia con un país para obtener el clima del campo y con la ciudad en una granularidad más fina. Si una ciudad es la mejor granularidad, entonces define la condición terminal para la asociación entre IC y LH para el clima. Esto significa que un usuario no puede obtener información meteorológica sobre la subdivisión de una ciudad. En realidad, el clima de una subdivisión no tiene ningún sentido. Desarrollamos un esquema de enfoque de mapeo heurístico simple basado en el requisito del usuario. Sea ic = {m1, m2, m3., ..., mk}, donde mi representa su elemento y vamos lh = {n1, n2, n3, ..., nl}, donde Ni representa el miembro de LHS. Definimos GPS para IC (GPSIC) ⊆ GPS y para LH (GPSLH) ⊆ GPS como GPSIC = {P1, P2, ..., Pn}, donde P1, P2, P3, ..., Pn son propiedades de sus miembros y GPSLH = {Q1, Q2, ..., QM} donde Q1, Q2, ..., QM son propiedades de sus miembros. Las propiedades de un miembro particular de IC son un subconjunto de GPSIC. En general, es cierto que (Conjunto de propiedades (mi∈ Ic) ∪ Conjunto de propiedades (mj∈ Ic)) ≠ ∅, sin embargo, puede haber casos en los que la intersección no es nula. Por ejemplo, el stock ∈ IC y la calificación de la película ∈ IC no tienen ninguna propiedad en común. Suponemos que dos o más miembros de IC tienen al menos una propiedad geográfica común (es decir, ubicación) porque los días transmiten información sobre esas categorías, que están estrechamente vinculadas con una ubicación. Por ejemplo, las acciones de una empresa están relacionadas con un país, el clima está relacionado con una ciudad o estado, etc. Definimos el subconjunto de propiedad de mi∈ Ic como psm i ∀ mi ∈ Ic y psm i = {p1, p2, ..., pr} donde r ≤ n.∀ PR {pr ∈ Psm I → Pr∈ GPSIC} que implica que ∀ I, PSM I ⊆ GPSIC. Las propiedades geográficas de este conjunto son indicativas de si MI ∈ Ic se puede asignar a un solo nivel de granularidad (es decir, una sola ubicación) en LH o niveles de granularidad múltiples (es decir, más de un nodos en 19 la jerarquía) en LH. ¿Cuántos y qué niveles de granularidad deben un mapa de MI depende del nivel en el que el proveedor de servicios desee proporcionar información sobre el MI en cuestión? Del mismo modo, definimos un subconjunto de propiedad de los miembros de LH como PSN J ∀ NJ ∈ LH que puede escribirse como PSN J = {Q1, Q2, Q3, ..., QS} donde s ≤ m.Además, ∀ QS {QS∈ PSN J → QS∈ GPSLH} que implica que ∀J, PSN J ⊆ GPSLH. El proceso de mapeo de IC a LH se identifica para algunos mx∈ IC uno o más ny∈ Lh tal que PSMX ∩ PSNV ≠ φ. Esto significa que cuando MX se asigna a NY y todos los niños de NY si MX puede mapear a múltiples niveles de granularidad o mapas MX solo para NY si MX puede mapear a un solo nivel de granularidad. Suponemos que los nuevos miembros pueden unirse y los viejos miembros pueden dejar IC o LH en cualquier momento. La eliminación de miembros del espacio IC es simple, pero la adición de miembros al espacio IC es más restrictiva. Si queremos agregar un nuevo miembro al espacio IC, primero definimos una propiedad establecida para el nuevo miembro: PSMNEW_M = {P1, P2, P3, ..., PT} y la agregamos solo si la condición: ∀PW {PW∈ PSPNEW_M → PW∈ GPSIC} está satisfecho. Este esquema tiene un beneficio adicional de permitir que los proveedores de servicios de información tengan un control sobre qué tipo de información desean proporcionar a los usuarios. Presentamos el siguiente ejemplo para ilustrar el concepto de mapeo. Ic = {tráfico, stock, restaurante, clima, fechas importantes de historia, condiciones de carretera} lh = {país, estado, ciudad, código postal, carreteras mayores} gpsic = {superficie-moderia, carreteras, alto, bajo, italiano-Alimentos, nombre de estatua, temperatura, nombre de la ciudad, disponibilidad de asientos, zip, jams de tráfico, precio de stock, nombre de campo, MajorRoadName, Wars, descubrimientos, mundo} GPSLH = {país, campo, nombre de estatua, nombre de la ciudad, zip, MajorRoadname} PS (ICSTOCK) = {Stock-privado, rentable, alto, bajo} ps (ictraffic) = {-modificación de superficie, carreteras, altas, bajas, Jams de tráfico, CityName} PS (fechas Icimpráticas en la historia) = {World, Wars, Discoveries}Ps (condiciones icroad) = {precipitación, statename, cityname} ps (iCrestaurant) = {italiano-comida, código zip} ps (icweather) = {statename, cityname, precipitación, temperatura} ps (lhcountry) = {countryName, campo}Ps (lhstate = {statename, tamaño de estado}, ps (lhcity) = {cityname, size de la ciudad} ps (lhzipcode) = {zipcodenum} ps (lhmajor roads) = {majorroadname} ahora, solo ps (icstock). Además, PS (ICSTOCK) indicó que el stock puede mapear solo un país de ubicación. Cuando consideramos el tráfico miembro del espacio IC, solo PS (ictraffic) ∩ pScity ≠ φ. Como PS (Ictraffic) indica que el tráfico puede mapear solo una ubicación, solo se asigna a la ciudad y a ninguno de sus hijos. Ahora, a diferencia del stock, el mapeo de tráfico con carreteras principales, que es un hijo de la ciudad, es significativo. Sin embargo, los proveedores de servicios tienen derecho a controlar los niveles de granularidad en los que desean proporcionar información sobre un miembro del espacio IC. PS (condiciones de icroad) ∩ Psstate ≠ φ y PS (condiciones de icroad) ∩ pScity ≠ φ. Por lo tanto, las condiciones de la carretera se asignan tanto al estado como a la ciudad. Como PS (condiciones de ICROAD) indica que las condiciones de la carretera pueden asignarse a múltiples niveles de granularidad, las condiciones de la carretera también se asignarán al código postal y las carreteras principales, que son los hijos del estado y la ciudad. Del mismo modo, los mapas de restaurantes solo para el código postal y los mapas meteorológicos para el estado, la ciudad y sus hijos, las carreteras principales y el código postal.5. Esquema de indexación basado en la ubicación Esta sección analiza nuestro esquema de indexación basado en la ubicación (LBIS). El esquema está diseñado para ajustarse a la transmisión de LDD en nuestros días de proyecto. Como se discutió anteriormente, utilizamos la propiedad de contención de LDD en el esquema de indexación. Esto limita significativamente la búsqueda de nuestros datos requeridos a una parte particular de la transmisión. Por lo tanto, argumentamos que el esquema proporciona tiempo de sintonización limitado. Describimos la arquitectura de nuestro esquema de indexación. Nuestro esquema contiene cubos de datos separados y cubos de índice. Los cubos de índice son de dos tipos. El primer tipo se llama el índice principal. El índice principal proporciona información sobre los tipos de datos transmitidos. Por ejemplo, si tenemos la intención de transmitir información como entretenimiento, clima, tráfico, etc., entonces el índice principal apunta a estos tipos principales de información y/o sus principales subtipos de información, el número de subtipos principales que varían de una información a otra. Esto limita estrictamente el número de accesos a un índice importante. El índice principal nunca apunta a los datos originales. Señala los índices subcontratales llamados índice menor. Los índices menores son los índices que realmente apuntan a los datos originales. Llamamos a estos punteros de índice menores como punteros de ubicación, ya que apunta a los datos asociados con una ubicación. Por lo tanto, nuestra búsqueda de datos incluye el acceso de un índice importante y algunos índices menores, el número de índice menor que varía según el tipo de información. Por lo tanto, nuestro esquema de indexación tiene en cuenta la naturaleza jerárquica del LDD, la propiedad de contención y requiere que nuestro horario de transmisión se agrupe en función del tipo de datos y la ubicación. La estructura de la jerarquía de ubicación requiere el uso de diferentes tipos de índice en diferentes niveles. La estructura y las posiciones del índice dependen estrictamente de la jerarquía de ubicación como se describe en nuestro esquema de mapeo anteriormente. Ilustramos la implementación de nuestro esquema con un ejemplo. Las reglas para enmarcar el índice se mencionan posteriormente.20 A1 Película de restaurante de entretenimiento A2 A3 A4 R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 CELIENCIA KC SL JC SF ENTRETENTO R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 KC SL JC SF (A, R, SIGUIENTE = 8) 3, R5 4, R7 Tipo, R7 Tipo(S, l) er w e em (1, 4) (5, 4) (1, 4), (9, 4) (9, 4) tipo (s, l) w e em er (1, 4) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 4) Tipo (S, L) E Em Er W (1, 8) (1, 4) (5, 4) (9, 4) A1 A1 A2 A3 A4 MEJORA DE RESTURADOR1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ÍNDICE MAYOR ÍNDICE MAYOR INDICE MAYOR ÍNDICE MENOR ÍNDICE MAYOR ÍNDICE MENOR Figura 3. Información mapeada de ubicación para la transmisión Figura 4. Datos junto con el ejemplo del índice basado en la ubicación: supongamos que nuestro contenido de transmisión contiene IcenterTernment y Icweather que se representa como se muestra en la figura 3. La IA representa áreas de ciudad e RI representa carreteras en un área determinada. Las hojas de la estructura meteorológica representan cuatro ciudades. La estructura del índice se da en la Fig. 4 que muestra la posición del índice mayor y menor y los datos en el cronograma de transmisión. Proponemos las siguientes reglas para la creación del cronograma de transmisión indexado de aire: • Se crean el índice principal y el índice menor.• El índice principal contiene la posición y la gama de diferentes tipos de elementos de datos (clima y entretenimiento, Figura 3) y sus categorías. Las sub categorías de entretenimiento, cine y restaurante, también están en el índice. Por lo tanto, el índice principal contiene entretenimiento (e), película de entretenimiento (EM), entretenimiento-restaurante (ER) y clima (W). La tuple (S, L) representa la (s) posición (s) inicial del elemento de datos y L representa el rango del elemento en términos de número de cubos de datos.• El índice menor contiene las variables A, R y un puntero a continuación. En nuestro ejemplo (Figura 3), la carretera R representa el primer nodo del área A. El índice menor se utiliza para señalar los cubos de datos reales presentes en los niveles más bajos de la jerarquía. En contraste, el índice principal apunta a una gama más amplia de ubicaciones y, por lo tanto, contiene información sobre las categorías principales y subcatíferas de datos.• La información del índice no se incorpora en los cubos de datos. Los cubos de índice están separados que contienen solo la información de control.• El número de los principales cubos de índice M = # (IC), IC = {IC1, IC2, IC3, ..., ICN} donde ICI representa el tipo de información y # representa la cardinalidad del conjunto de contenido de información. En este ejemplo, ic = {icmovie, icweather, restaurante} y sonic) = 3. Por lo tanto, el número de principales cubos de índice es 3. • El mecanismo para resolver la consulta está presente en el coordinador basado en Java en MU. Por ejemplo, si una consulta Q se presenta como Q (Entertainment, Movie, Road_1), entonces la búsqueda resultante será para la información de EM en el índice principal. Decimos, Q em. Nuestro índice propuesto funciona de la siguiente manera: supongamos que un MU emite una consulta representada por el coordinador de Java presente en el MU como información del restaurante en la carretera 7. Esto es resuelto por el coordinador como Q er. Esto significa que uno debe buscar la unidad de índice ER en el índice principal. Supongamos que el MU registra el canal en R2. El primer índice que recibe es un índice menor después de R2. En este índice, el valor de la siguiente variable = 4, lo que significa que el siguiente índice principal está presente después del cubo 4. El MU puede entrar en modo Doze. Se activa después del cubo 4 y recibe el índice principal. Busca información de ER, que es la primera entrada en este índice. Ahora es seguro que el MU obtendrá la posición del cubo de datos en el índice menor adyacente. La segunda unidad en el índice menor representa la posición de los datos requeridos R7. Dice que el cubo de datos es el primer cubo en el área 4. El MU entra en modo Doze nuevamente y se activa después del cubo 6. Obtiene los datos requeridos en el siguiente cubo. Presentamos el algoritmo para buscar el índice basado en la ubicación. Algoritmo 1 Búsqueda de índice basado en ubicación en los días 1.

La conservación de la energía de la evaluación del rendimiento es la principal preocupación cuando intentamos acceder a los datos de la transmisión inalámbrica. Un esquema eficiente debe permitir que el dispositivo móvil acceda a sus datos requeridos permaneciendo activos durante un período mínimo de tiempo. Esto ahorraría una cantidad considerable de energía. Dado que los elementos se distribuyen según los tipos y se asignan a ubicaciones adecuadas, argumentamos que nuestra transmisión trata con los tipos de datos agrupados. La unidad móvil tiene que acceder a un índice importante más grande y un índice menor relativamente más pequeño para obtener información sobre el momento de la llegada de los datos. Esto contrasta con el esquema exponencial donde los índices son de igual tamaños. El ejemplo discutido y el Algoritmo 1 revela que para acceder a cualquier datos, necesitamos acceder al índice principal solo una vez seguido de uno o más accesos al índice menor. El número de acceso al índice menor depende del número de ubicaciones internas. Como el número de ubicaciones internas varía para un elemento a otro (por ejemplo, el clima generalmente se asocia con una ciudad, mientras que el tráfico está granulado hasta carreteras principales y menores de una ciudad), argumentamos que la estructura de la información mapeada de ubicación puede visualizarseComo un bosque que es una colección de árboles generales, el número de árboles generales que depende de los tipos de información transmitidos y la profundidad de un árbol dependiendo de la granularidad de la información de ubicación asociada con la información. Para nuestros experimentos, asumimos el bosque como una colección de árboles M-ARRY equilibrados. Además, asumimos que los árboles M-ARY están llenos al asumir la presencia de nodos ficticios en diferentes niveles de un árbol. Por lo tanto, si el número de elementos de datos es d y la altura del árbol es m, entonces n = (m*d-1)/(m-1) donde n es el número de vértices en el árbol y i = (D-1)/(M-1) donde yo es el número de vértices internos. El tiempo de ajuste para un elemento de datos implica 1 unidad de tiempo requerida para acceder al índice principal más el tiempo requerido para acceder a los elementos de datos presentes en las hojas del árbol. Por lo tanto, el tiempo de ajuste con los elementos de datos D es t = logmd+1 podemos decir que el tiempo de ajuste está limitado por O (LOGMD). Comparamos nuestro esquema con la indexación distribuida y el esquema exponencial. Suponemos una transmisión plana y un número de páginas que varían de 5000 a 25000. Los diversos parámetros de simulación se muestran en la Tabla 1. La Figura 5-8 muestra los tiempos de sintonización relativos de tres algoritmos de indexación, es decir, LBIS, esquema exponencial y el esquema de árbol distribuido. La Figura 5 muestra el resultado para el número de nodos de ubicación interna = 3. Podemos ver que los LBI superan significativamente los otros esquemas. El tiempo de sintonización en LBIs varía de aproximadamente 6.8 a 8. Este gran tiempo de ajuste se debe al hecho de que después de alcanzar el índice menor más bajo, el MU puede tener que acceder a pocos cubos secuencialmente para obtener el cubo de datos requerido. Podemos ver que el tiempo de sintonización tiende a ser estable a medida que aumenta la longitud de la transmisión. En la Figura 6 consideramos M = 4. Aquí podemos ver que el exponencial y el distribuido funcionan casi de manera similar, aunque el primero parece funcionar un poco mejor a medida que aumenta la longitud de transmisión. Un patrón muy interesante es visible en la Figura 7. Para un tamaño de transmisión más pequeño, el LBI parece tener un tiempo de ajuste más grande que los otros dos esquemas. Pero a medida que aumenta la duración de la transmisión, es claramente visible que el LBI supera a los otros dos esquemas. La indexación de árbol distribuido muestra un comportamiento similar como los LBI. El tiempo de sintonización en LBI sigue siendo bajo porque el algoritmo permite que la MU saltea algunos índices menores intermedios. Esto permite que el MU se mueva a niveles más bajos directamente después de entrar en modo activo, ahorrando así una energía valiosa. Esta acción no es posible en la indexación de árbol distribuido y, por lo tanto, podemos observar que su tiempo de ajuste es más que el esquema LBIS, aunque funciona mejor que el esquema exponencial. La Figura 8, en contraste, nos muestra que el tiempo de ajuste en LBI, aunque menos que los otros dos esquemas, tiende a aumentar bruscamente a medida que la longitud de transmisión se vuelve mayor que las 15000 páginas. Esto puede atribuirse tanto debido al aumento en el tiempo requerido para escanear los índices menores intermedios y la longitud de la transmisión. Pero podemos observar que la pendiente de la curva LBIS es significativamente menor que las otras dos curvas. Tabla 1 Parámetros de simulación P Valores de definición P Número de elementos de datos 5000 - 25000 m Número de nodos de ubicación interna 3, 4, 5, 6 B Capacidad de cubo sin índice (para índice exponencial) 10,64,128,256 I Base de índice para el índice exponencial 2,4,6,8 K Tamaño del índice para el árbol distribuido 8 bytes Los resultados de la simulación establecen algunos hechos sobre nuestro esquema de indexación basado en la ubicación. El esquema funciona mejor que los otros dos esquemas en términos de tiempo de sintonización en la mayoría de los casos. A medida que aumenta la longitud de la transmisión, después de un cierto punto, aunque el tiempo de ajuste aumenta como resultado de los factores que hemos descrito antes, el esquema siempre funciona mejor que los otros dos esquemas. Debido al límite prescrito del número de páginas en el documento, no podemos mostrar más resultados. Pero estos resultados omitidos muestran una tendencia similar a los resultados representados en la Figura 5-8.7. Conclusión y trabajo futuro En este documento hemos presentado un esquema para el mapeo de datos de transmisión inalámbrica con sus ubicaciones. Hemos presentado un ejemplo para mostrar cómo la estructura jerárquica del árbol de ubicación se mapea con los datos para crear LDD. Hemos presentado un esquema llamado LBI para indexar este LDD. Hemos utilizado la propiedad de contención de LDD en el esquema que limita la búsqueda a un rango estrecho de datos en la transmisión, ahorrando así una energía valiosa en el dispositivo. La asignación de datos con ubicaciones y el esquema de indexación se utilizará en nuestro proyecto Days para crear la arquitectura basada en push. El LBI se ha comparado con otros dos esquemas de indexación prominentes, es decir, el esquema de indexación de árbol distribuido y el esquema de indexación exponencial. Mostramos en nuestras simulaciones que el esquema LBI tiene el tiempo de ajuste más bajo para las transmisiones que tienen una gran cantidad de páginas, ahorrando así una valiosa potencia de batería en el MU.22 En el futuro trabajo, intentamos incorporar la arquitectura basada en la extracción en nuestro proyecto Days. Los datos del servidor están disponibles para el acceso por los usuarios globales. Esto se puede hacer colocando una solicitud al servidor de origen. La consulta en este caso es una consulta global. Se transfiere desde el servidor de origen de los usuarios al servidor de destino mediante el uso de satélites LEO. Tenemos la intención de utilizar nuestro esquema LDD y arquitectura de estadificación de datos en la arquitectura basada en Pull. Mostraremos que el esquema LDD junto con la arquitectura de estadificación de datos mejora significativamente la latencia para la consulta global y local.8. Referencias [1] Acharya, S., Alonso, R.

        "Location based Indexing Scheme for DAYS Debopam Acharya and Vijay Kumar 1 Computer Science and Informatics University of Missouri-Kansas City Kansas City, MO 64110 dargc(kumarv)@umkc.edu ABSTRACT Data dissemination through wireless channels for broadcasting information to consumers is becoming quite common.",
        "Many dissemination schemes have been proposed but most of them push data to wireless channels for general consumption.",
        "Push based broadcast [1] is essentially asymmetric, i.e., the volume of data being higher from the server to the users than from the users back to the server.",
        "Push based scheme requires some indexing which indicates when the data will be broadcast and its position in the broadcast.",
        "Access latency and tuning time are the two main parameters which may be used to evaluate an indexing scheme.",
        "Two of the important indexing schemes proposed earlier were tree based and the exponential indexing schemes.",
        "None of these schemes were able to address the requirements of location dependent data (LDD) which is highly desirable feature of data dissemination.",
        "In this paper, we discuss the broadcast of LDD in our project DAta in Your Space (DAYS), and propose a scheme for indexing LDD.",
        "We argue that this scheme, when applied to LDD, significantly improves performance in terms of tuning time over the above mentioned schemes.",
        "We prove our argument with the help of simulation results.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.1 [Information Systems]: Information Storage and Retrieval - content analysis and indexing; H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Storage and Retrieval - information search and retrieval.",
        "General Terms Algorithms, Performance, Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Wireless data dissemination is an economical and efficient way to make desired data available to a large number of mobile or static users.",
        "The mode of data transfer is essentially asymmetric, that is, the capacity of the transfer of data (downstream communication) from the server to the client (mobile user) is significantly larger than the client or mobile user to the server (upstream communication).",
        "The effectiveness of a data dissemination system is judged by its ability to provide user the required data at anywhere and at anytime.",
        "One of the best ways to accomplish this is through the dissemination of highly personalized Location Based Services (LBS) which allows users to access personalized location dependent data.",
        "An example would be someone using their mobile device to search for a vegetarian restaurant.",
        "The LBS application would interact with other location technology components or use the mobile users input to determine the users location and download the information about the restaurants in proximity to the user by tuning into the wireless channel which is disseminating LDD.",
        "We see a limited deployment of LBS by some service providers.",
        "But there are every indications that with time some of the complex technical problems such as uniform location framework, calculating and tracking locations in all types of places, positioning in various environments, innovative location applications, etc., will be resolved and LBS will become a common facility and will help to improve market productivity and customer comfort.",
        "In our project called DAYS, we use wireless data broadcast mechanism to push LDD to users and mobile users monitor and tune the channel to find and download the required data.",
        "A simple broadcast, however, is likely to cause significant performance degradation in the energy constrained mobile devices and a common solution to this problem is the use of efficient air indexing.",
        "The indexing approach stores control information which tells the user about the data location in the broadcast and how and when he could access it.",
        "A mobile user, thus, has some free time to go into the doze mode which conserves valuable power.",
        "It also allows the user to personalize his own mobile device by selectively tuning to the information of his choice.",
        "Access efficiency and energy conservation are the two issues which are significant for data broadcast systems.",
        "Access efficiency refers to the latency experienced when a request is initiated till the response is received.",
        "Energy conservation [7, 10] refers to the efficient use of the limited energy of the mobile device in accessing broadcast data.",
        "Two parameters that affect these are the tuning time and the access latency.",
        "Tuning time refers to the time during which the mobile unit (MU) remains in active state to tune the channel and download its required data.",
        "It can also be defined as the number of buckets tuned by the mobile device in active state to get its required data.",
        "Access latency may be defined as the time elapsed since a request has been issued till the response has been received. 1 This research was supported by a grant from NSF IIS-0209170.",
        "Several indexing schemes have been proposed in the past and the prominent among them are the tree based and the exponential indexing schemes [17].",
        "The main disadvantages of the tree based schemes are that they are based on centralized tree structures.",
        "To start a search, the MU has to wait until it reaches the root of the next broadcast tree.",
        "This significantly affects the tuning time of the mobile unit.",
        "The exponential schemes facilitate index replication by sharing links in different search trees.",
        "For broadcasts with large number of pages, the exponential scheme has been shown to perform similarly as the tree based schemes in terms of access latency.",
        "Also, the average length of broadcast increases due to the index replication and this may cause significant increase in the access latency.",
        "None of the above indexing schemes is equally effective in broadcasting location dependent data.",
        "In addition to providing low latency, they lack properties which are used to address LDD issues.",
        "We propose an indexing scheme in DAYS which takes care of some these problems.",
        "We show with simulation results that our scheme outperforms some of the earlier indexing schemes for broadcasting LDD in terms of tuning time.",
        "The rest of the paper is presented as follows.",

        "PREVIOUS WORK Several disk-based indexing techniques have been used for air indexing.",
        "Imielinski et al. [5, 6] applied the B+ index tree, where the leaf nodes store the arrival times of the data items.",
        "The distributed indexing method was proposed to efficiently replicate and distribute the index tree in a broadcast.",
        "Specifically, the index tree is divided into a replicated part and a non replicated part.",
        "Each broadcast consists of the replicated part and the nonreplicated part that indexes the data items immediately following it.",
        "As such, each node in the non-replicated part appears only once in a broadcast and, hence, reduces the replication cost and access latency while achieving a good tuning time.",
        "Chen et al. [2] and Shivakumar et al. [8] considered unbalanced tree structures to optimize energy consumption for non-uniform data access.",
        "These structures minimize the average index search cost by reducing the number of index searches for hot data at the expense of spending more on cold data.",
        "Tan and Yu discussed data and index organization under skewed broadcast Hashing and signature methods have also been suggested for wireless broadcast that supports equality queries [9].",
        "A flexible indexing method was proposed in [5].",
        "The flexible index first sorts the data items in ascending (or descending) order of the search key values and then divides them into p segments.",
        "The first bucket in each data segment contains a control index, which is a binary index mapping a given key value to the segment containing that key, and a local index, which is an m-entry index mapping a given key value to the buckets within the current segment.",
        "By tuning the parameters of p and m, mobile clients can achieve either a good tuning time or good access latency.",
        "Another indexing technique proposed is the exponential indexing scheme [17].",
        "In this scheme, a parameterized index, called the exponential index is used to optimize the access latency or the tuning time.",
        "It facilitates index replication by linking different search trees.",
        "All of the above mentioned schemes have been applied to data which are non related to each other.",
        "These non related data may be clustered or non clustered.",
        "However, none of them has specifically addressed the requirements of LDD.",
        "Location dependent data are data which are associated with a location.",
        "Presently there are several applications that deal with LDD [13, 16].",
        "Almost all of them depict LDD with the help of hierarchical structures [3, 4].",
        "This is based on the containment property of location dependent data.",
        "The Containment property helps determining relative position of an object by defining or identifying locations that contains those objects.",
        "The subordinate locations are hierarchically related to each other.",
        "Thus, Containment property limits the range of availability or operation of a service.",
        "We use this containment property in our indexing scheme to index LDD. 3.",
        "DAYS ARCHITECTURE DAYS has been conceptualized to disseminate topical and nontopical data to users in a local broadcast space and to accept queries from individual users globally.",
        "Topical data, for example, weather information, traffic information, stock information, etc., constantly changes over time.",
        "Non topical data such as hotel, restaurant, real estate prices, etc., do not change so often.",
        "Thus, we envision the presence of two types of data distribution: In the first case, server pushes data to local users through wireless channels.",
        "The other case deals with the server sending results of user queries through downlink wireless channels.",
        "Technically, we see the presence of two types of queues in the pull based data access.",
        "One is a heavily loaded queue containing globally uploaded queries.",
        "The other is a comparatively lightly loaded queue consisting of locally uploaded queries.",
        "The DAYS architecture [12] as shown in figure 1 consists of a Data Server, Broadcast Scheduler, DAYS Coordinator, Network of LEO satellites for global data delivery and a Local broadcast space.",
        "Data is pushed into the local broadcast space so that users may tune into the wireless channels to access the data.",
        "The local broadcast space consists of a broadcast tower, mobile units and a network of data staging machines called the surrogates.",
        "Data staging in surrogates has been earlier investigated as a successful technique [12, 15] to cache users related data.",
        "We believe that data staging can be used to drastically reduce the latency time for both the local broadcast data as well as global responses.",

        "LOCATION DEPENDENT DATA (LDD) We argue that incorporating location information in wireless data broadcast can significantly decrease the access latency.",
        "This property becomes highly useful for mobile unit which has limited storage and processing capability.",
        "There are a variety of applications to obtain information about traffic, restaurant and hotel booking, fast food, gas stations, post office, grocery stores, etc.",
        "If these applications are coupled with location information, then the search will be fast and highly cost effective.",
        "An important property of the locations is Containment which helps to determine the relative location of an object with respect to its parent that contains the object.",
        "Thus, Containment limits the range of availability of a data.",
        "We use this property in our indexing scheme.",
        "The database contains the broadcast contents which are converted into LDD [14] by associating them with respective locations so that it can be broadcasted in a clustered manner.",
        "The clustering of LDD helps the user to locate information efficiently and supports containment property.",
        "We present an example to justify our proposition.",
        "Example: Suppose a user issues query Starbucks Coffee in Plaza please. to access information about the Plaza branch of Starbucks Coffee in Kansas City.",
        "In the case of location independent set up the system will list all Starbucks coffee shops in Kansas City area.",
        "It is obvious that such responses will increase access latency and are not desirable.",
        "These can be managed efficiently if the server has location dependent data, i.e., a mapping between a Starbucks coffee shop data and its physical location.",
        "Also, for a query including range of locations of Starbucks, a single query requesting locations for the entire region of Kansas City, as shown in Figure 2, will suffice.",
        "This will save enormous amount of bandwidth by decreasing the number of messages and at the same time will be helpful in preventing the scalability bottleneck in highly populated area. 4.1 Mapping Function for LDD The example justifies the need for a mapping function to process location dependent queries.",
        "This will be especially important for pull based queries across the globe for which the reply could be composed for different parts of the world.",
        "The mapping function is necessary to construct the broadcast schedule.",
        "We define Global Property Set (GPS) [11], Information Content (IC) set, and Location Hierarchy (LH) set where IC ⊆ GPS and LH ⊆ GPS to develop a mapping function.",
        "LH = {l1, l2, l3…,lk} where li represent locations in the location tree and IC = {ic1, ic2, ic3,…,icn} where ici represent information type.",
        "For example, if we have traffic, weather, and stock information are in broadcast then IC = {ictraffic, icweather, and icstock}.",
        "The mapping scheme must be able to identify and select an IC member and a LH node for (a) correct association, (b) granularity match, (c) and termination condition.",
        "For example, weather ∈ IC could be associated with a country or a state or a city or a town of LH.",
        "The granularity match between the weather and a LH node is as per user requirement.",
        "Thus, with a coarse granularity weather information is associated with a country to get countrys weather and with town in a finer granularity.",
        "If a town is the finest granularity, then it defines the terminal condition for association between IC and LH for weather.",
        "This means that a user cannot get weather information about subdivision of a town.",
        "In reality weather of a subdivision does not make any sense.",
        "We develop a simple heuristic mapping approach scheme based on user requirement.",
        "Let IC = {m1, m2,m3 .,..., mk}, where mi represent its element and let LH = {n1, n2, n3, ..., nl}, where ni represents LHs member.",
        "We define GPS for IC (GPSIC) ⊆ GPS and for LH (GPSLH) ⊆ GPS as GPSIC = {P1, P2,…, Pn}, where P1, P2, P3,…, Pn are properties of its members and GPSLH = {Q1, Q2,…, Qm} where Q1, Q2,…, Qm are properties of its members.",
        "The properties of a particular member of IC are a subset of GPSIC.",
        "It is generally true that (property set (mi∈ IC) ∪ property set (mj∈ IC)) ≠ ∅, however, there may be cases where the intersection is not null.",
        "For example, stock ∈ IC and movie ∈ IC rating do not have any property in common.",
        "We assume that any two or more members of IC have at least one common geographical property (i.e. location) because DAYS broadcasts information about those categories, which are closely tied with a location.",
        "For example, stock of a company is related to a country, weather is related to a city or state, etc.",
        "We define the property subset of mi∈ IC as PSm i ∀ mi ∈ IC and PSm i = {P1, P2, ..., Pr} where r ≤ n. ∀ Pr {Pr ∈ PSm i → Pr∈ GPSIC} which implies that ∀ i, PSm i ⊆ GPSIC.",
        "The geographical properties of this set are indicative of whether mi ∈ IC can be mapped to only a single granularity level (i.e. a single location) in LH or a multiple granularity levels (i.e. more than one nodes in 19 the hierarchy) in LH.",
        "How many and which granularity levels should a mi map to, depends upon the level at which the service provider wants to provide information about the mi in question.",
        "Similarly we define a property subset of LH members as PSn j ∀ nj ∈ LH which can be written as PSn j ={Q1, Q2, Q3, …, Qs} where s ≤ m. In addition, ∀ Qs {Qs∈ PSn j → Qs∈ GPSLH} which implies that ∀j, PSn j ⊆ GPSLH.",
        "The process of mapping from IC to LH is then identifying for some mx∈ IC one or more ny∈ LH such that PSmx ∩ PSnv ≠ φ.",
        "This means that when mx maps to ny and all children of ny if mx can map to multiple granularity levels or mx maps only to ny if mx can map to a single granularity level.",
        "We assume that new members can join and old member can leave IC or LH any time.",
        "The deletion of members from the IC space is simple but addition of members to the IC space is more restrictive.",
        "If we want to add a new member to the IC space, then we first define a property set for the new member: PSmnew_m ={P1, P2, P3, …, Pt} and add it to the IC only if the condition:∀ Pw {Pw∈ PSpnew_m → Pw∈ GPSIC} is satisfied.",
        "This scheme has an additional benefit of allowing the information service providers to have a control over what kind of information they wish to provide to the users.",
        "We present the following example to illustrate the mapping concept.",
        "IC = {Traffic, Stock, Restaurant, Weather, Important history dates, Road conditions} LH = {Country, State, City, Zip-code, Major-roads} GPSIC = {Surface-mobility, Roads, High, Low, Italian-food, StateName, Temp, CityName, Seat-availability, Zip, Traffic-jams, Stock-price, CountryName, MajorRoadName, Wars, Discoveries, World} GPSLH = {Country, CountrySize, StateName, CityName, Zip, MajorRoadName} Ps(ICStock) = {Stock-price, CountryName, High, Low} Ps(ICTraffic) = {Surface-mobility, Roads, High, Low, Traffic-jams, CityName} Ps(ICImportant dates in history) = {World, Wars, Discoveries} Ps(ICRoad conditions) = {Precipitation, StateName, CityName} Ps(ICRestaurant) = {Italian-food, Zip code} Ps(ICWeather) = {StateName, CityName, Precipitation, Temperature} PS(LHCountry) = {CountryName, CountrySize} PS(LHState = {StateName, State size}, PS(LHCity) ={CityName, City size} PS(LHZipcode) = {ZipCodeNum } PS(LHMajor roads) = {MajorRoadName} Now, only PS(ICStock) ∩ PSCountry ≠φ.",
        "In addition, PS(ICStock) indicated that Stock can map to only a single location Country.",
        "When we consider the member Traffic of IC space, only PS(ICTraffic) ∩ PScity ≠ φ.",
        "As PS(ICTraffic) indicates that Traffic can map to only a single location, it maps only to City and none of its children.",
        "Now unlike Stock, mapping of Traffic with Major roads, which is a child of City, is meaningful.",

        "The scheme is designed to conform to the LDD broadcast in our project DAYS.",
        "As discussed earlier, we use the containment property of LDD in the indexing scheme.",
        "This significantly limits the search of our required data to a particular portion of broadcast.",
        "Thus, we argue that the scheme provides bounded tuning time.",
        "We describe the architecture of our indexing scheme.",
        "Our scheme contains separate data buckets and index buckets.",
        "The index buckets are of two types.",
        "The first type is called the Major index.",
        "The Major index provides information about the types of data broadcasted.",
        "For example, if we intend to broadcast information like Entertainment, Weather, Traffic etc., then the major index points to either these major types of information and/or their main subtypes of information, the number of main subtypes varying from one information to another.",
        "This strictly limits number of accesses to a Major index.",
        "The Major index never points to the original data.",
        "It points to the sub indexes called the Minor index.",
        "The minor indexes are the indexes which actually points to the original data.",
        "We called these minor index pointers as Location Pointers as they points to the data which are associated with a location.",
        "Thus, our search for a data includes accessing of a major index and some minor indexes, the number of minor index varying depending on the type of information.",
        "Thus, our indexing scheme takes into account the hierarchical nature of the LDD, the Containment property, and requires our broadcast schedule to be clustered based on data type and location.",
        "The structure of the location hierarchy requires the use of different types of index at different levels.",
        "The structure and positions of index strictly depend on the location hierarchy as described in our mapping scheme earlier.",
        "We illustrate the implementation of our scheme with an example.",

        "The index structure is given in Fig. 4 which shows the position of major and minor index and data in the broadcast schedule.",
        "We propose the following rules for the creation of the air indexed broadcast schedule: • The major index and the minor index are created. • The major index contains the position and range of different types of data items (Weather and Entertainment, Figure 3) and their categories.",
        "The sub categories of Entertainment, Movie and Restaurant, are also in the index.",
        "Thus, the major index contains Entertainment (E), Entertainment-Movie (EM), Entertainment-Restaurant (ER), and Weather (W).",
        "The tuple (S, L) represents the starting position (S) of the data item and L represents the range of the item in terms of number of data buckets. • The minor index contains the variables A, R and a pointer Next.",
        "In our example (Figure 3), road R represents the first node of area A.",
        "The minor index is used to point to actual data buckets present at the lowest levels of the hierarchy.",
        "In contrast, the major index points to a broader range of locations and so it contains information about main and sub categories of data. • Index information is not incorporated in the data buckets.",

        "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION Conservation of energy is the main concern when we try to access data from wireless broadcast.",
        "An efficient scheme should allow the mobile device to access its required data by staying active for a minimum amount of time.",
        "This would save considerable amount of energy.",
        "Since items are distributed based on types and are mapped to suitable locations, we argue that our broadcast deals with clustered data types.",
        "The mobile unit has to access a larger major index and a relatively much smaller minor index to get information about the time of arrival of data.",
        "This is in contrast to the exponential scheme where the indexes are of equal sizes.",
        "The example discussed and Algorithm 1 reveals that to access any data, we need to access the major index only once followed by one or more accesses to the minor index.",
        "The number of minor index access depends on the number of internal locations.",
        "As the number of internal locations vary for item to item (for example, Weather is generally associated with a City whereas traffic is granulated up to major and minor roads of a city), we argue that the structure of the location mapped information may be visualized as a forest which is a collection of general trees, the number of general trees depending on the types of information broadcasted and depth of a tree depending on the granularity of the location information associated with the information.",
        "For our experiments, we assume the forest as a collection of balanced M-ary trees.",
        "We further assume the M-ary trees to be full by assuming the presence of dummy nodes in different levels of a tree.",
        "Thus, if the number of data items is d and the height of the tree is m, then n= (m*d-1)/(m-1) where n is the number of vertices in the tree and i= (d-1)/(m-1) where i is the number of internal vertices.",
        "Tuning time for a data item involves 1 unit of time required to access the major index plus time required to access the data items present in the leaves of the tree.",
        "Thus, tuning time with d data items is t = logmd+1 We can say that tuning time is bounded by O(logmd).",
        "We compare our scheme with the distributed indexing and exponential scheme.",
        "We assume a flat broadcast and number of pages varying from 5000 to 25000.",
        "The various simulation parameters are shown in Table 1.",
        "Figure 5-8 shows the relative tuning times of three indexing algorithms, ie, the LBIS, exponential scheme and the distributed tree scheme.",
        "Figure 5 shows the result for number of internal location nodes = 3.",
        "We can see that LBIS significantly outperforms both the other schemes.",
        "The tuning time in LBIS ranges from approx 6.8 to 8.",
        "This large tuning time is due to the fact that after reaching the lowest minor index, the MU may have to access few buckets sequentially to get the required data bucket.",
        "We can see that the tuning time tends to become stable as the length of broadcast increases.",
        "In figure 6 we consider m= 4.",
        "Here we can see that the exponential and the distributed perform almost similarly, though the former seems to perform slightly better as the broadcast length increases.",
        "A very interesting pattern is visible in figure 7.",
        "For smaller broadcast size, the LBIS seems to have larger tuning time than the other two schemes.",
        "But as the length of broadcast increases, it is clearly visible the LBIS outperforms the other two schemes.",
        "The Distributed tree indexing shows similar behavior like the LBIS.",
        "The tuning time in LBIS remains low because the algorithm allows the MU to skip some intermediate Minor Indexes.",
        "This allows the MU to move into lower levels directly after coming into active mode, thus saving valuable energy.",
        "This action is not possible in the distributed tree indexing and hence we can observe that its tuning time is more than the LBIS scheme, although it performs better than the exponential scheme.",
        "Figure 8, in contrast, shows us that the tuning time in LBIS, though less than the other two schemes, tends to increase sharply as the broadcast length becomes greater than the 15000 pages.",
        "This may be attributed both due to increase in time required to scan the intermediate Minor Indexes and the length of the broadcast.",
        "But we can observe that the slope of the LBIS curve is significantly less than the other two curves.",
        "Table 1 Simulation Parameters P Definition Values N Number of data Items 5000 - 25000 m Number of internal location nodes 3, 4, 5, 6 B Capacity of bucket without index (for exponential index) 10,64,128,256 i Index base for exponential index 2,4,6,8 k Index size for distributed tree 8 bytes The simulation results establish some facts about our location based indexing scheme.",
        "The scheme performs better than the other two schemes in terms of tuning time in most of the cases.",
        "As the length of the broadcast increases, after a certain point, though the tuning time increases as a result of factors which we have described before, the scheme always performs better than the other two schemes.",
        "Due to the prescribed limit of the number of pages in the paper, we are unable to show more results.",
        "But these omitted results show similar trend as the results depicted in figure 5-8. 7.",
        "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have presented a scheme for mapping of wireless broadcast data with their locations.",
        "We have presented an example to show how the hierarchical structure of the location tree maps with the data to create LDD.",
        "We have presented a scheme called LBIS to index this LDD.",
        "We have used the containment property of LDD in the scheme that limits the search to a narrow range of data in the broadcast, thus saving valuable energy in the device.",
        "The mapping of data with locations and the indexing scheme will be used in our DAYS project to create the push based architecture.",
        "The LBIS has been compared with two other prominent indexing schemes, i.e., the distributed tree indexing scheme and the exponential indexing scheme.",
        "We showed in our simulations that the LBIS scheme has the lowest tuning time for broadcasts having large number of pages, thus saving valuable battery power in the MU. 22 In the future work we try to incorporate pull based architecture in our DAYS project.",
        "Data from the server is available for access by the global users.",
        "This may be done by putting a request to the source server.",
        "The query in this case is a global query.",
        "It is transferred from the users source server to the destination server through the use of LEO satellites.",
        "We intend to use our LDD scheme and data staging architecture in the pull based architecture.",
        "We will show that the LDD scheme together with the data staging architecture significantly improves the latency for global as well as local query. 8.",

                "This large tuning time is due to the fact that after reaching the lowest minor index, the MU may have to access few buckets sequentially to get the required data bucket.",
                "We can see that the tuning time tends to become stable as the length of broadcast increases.",
                "In figure 6 we consider m= 4.",
                "Here we can see that the exponential and the distributed perform almost similarly, though the former seems to perform slightly better as the broadcast length increases.",
                "A very interesting pattern is visible in figure 7.",
                "For smaller broadcast size, the LBIS seems to have larger tuning time than the other two schemes.",
                "But as the length of broadcast increases, it is clearly visible the LBIS outperforms the other two schemes.",
                "The Distributed tree indexing shows similar behavior like the LBIS.",
                "The tuning time in LBIS remains low because the algorithm allows the MU to skip some intermediate Minor Indexes.",
                "This allows the MU to move into lower levels directly after coming into active mode, thus saving valuable energy.",
                "This action is not possible in the distributed tree indexing and hence we can observe that its tuning time is more than the LBIS scheme, although it performs better than the exponential scheme.",
                "Figure 8, in contrast, shows us that the tuning time in LBIS, though less than the other two schemes, tends to increase sharply as the broadcast length becomes greater than the 15000 pages.",
                "This may be attributed both due to increase in time required to scan the intermediate Minor Indexes and the length of the broadcast.",
                "But we can observe that the slope of the LBIS curve is significantly less than the other two curves.",

                "The scheme performs better than the other two schemes in terms of tuning time in most of the cases.",
                "As the length of the broadcast increases, after a certain point, though the tuning time increases as a result of factors which we have described before, the scheme always performs better than the other two schemes.",

                "We have presented a scheme called LBIS to index this LDD.",
                "We have used the containment property of LDD in the scheme that limits the search to a narrow range of data in the broadcast, thus saving valuable energy in the device.",

                "The LBIS has been compared with two other prominent indexing schemes, i.e., the distributed tree indexing scheme and the exponential indexing scheme.",
                "We showed in our simulations that the LBIS scheme has the lowest tuning time for broadcasts having large number of pages, thus saving valuable battery power in the MU. 22 In the future work we try to incorporate pull based architecture in our DAYS project.",

                "The mode of data transfer is essentially asymmetric, that is, the capacity of the transfer of data (downstream communication) from the server to the client (mobile user) is significantly larger than the client or mobile user to the server (upstream communication).",
                "The effectiveness of a data dissemination system is judged by its ability to provide user the required data at anywhere and at anytime.",
                "One of the best ways to accomplish this is through the dissemination of highly personalized Location Based Services (LBS) which allows users to access personalized location dependent data.",
                "An example would be someone using their mobile device to search for a vegetarian restaurant.",
                "The LBS application would interact with other location technology components or use the mobile users input to determine the users location and download the information about the restaurants in proximity to the user by tuning into the wireless channel which is disseminating <br>ldd</br>.",
                "We see a limited deployment of LBS by some service providers.",
                "But there are every indications that with time some of the complex technical problems such as uniform location framework, calculating and tracking locations in all types of places, positioning in various environments, innovative location applications, etc., will be resolved and LBS will become a common facility and will help to improve market productivity and customer comfort.",
                "In our project called DAYS, we use wireless data broadcast mechanism to push <br>ldd</br> to users and mobile users monitor and tune the channel to find and download the required data.",
                "A simple broadcast, however, is likely to cause significant performance degradation in the energy constrained mobile devices and a common solution to this problem is the use of efficient air indexing.",

                "A mobile user, thus, has some free time to go into the doze mode which conserves valuable power.",

                "The main disadvantages of the tree based schemes are that they are based on centralized tree structures.",
                "To start a search, the MU has to wait until it reaches the root of the next broadcast tree.",

                "For broadcasts with large number of pages, the exponential scheme has been shown to perform similarly as the tree based schemes in terms of access latency.",
                "Also, the average length of broadcast increases due to the index replication and this may cause significant increase in the access latency.",
                "None of the above indexing schemes is equally effective in broadcasting location dependent data.",

                "Each broadcast consists of the replicated part and the nonreplicated part that indexes the data items immediately following it.",
                "As such, each node in the non-replicated part appears only once in a broadcast and, hence, reduces the replication cost and access latency while achieving a good tuning time.",

                "The first bucket in each data segment contains a control index, which is a binary index mapping a given key value to the segment containing that key, and a local index, which is an m-entry index mapping a given key value to the buckets within the current segment.",
                "By tuning the parameters of p and m, mobile clients can achieve either a good tuning time or good access latency.",
                "Another indexing technique proposed is the exponential indexing scheme [17].",
                "In this scheme, a parameterized index, called the exponential index is used to optimize the access latency or the tuning time.",

                "The tuning time in LBIS ranges from approx 6.8 to 8.",

                "The Distributed tree indexing shows similar behavior like the LBIS.",
                "The tuning time in LBIS remains low because the algorithm allows the MU to skip some intermediate Minor Indexes.",

                "The effectiveness of a data dissemination system is judged by its ability to provide user the required data at anywhere and at anytime.",
                "One of the best ways to accomplish this is through the dissemination of highly personalized Location Based Services (LBS) which allows users to access personalized location dependent data.",

                "We have presented a scheme called LBIS to index this LDD.",
                "We have used the containment property of LDD in the scheme that limits the search to a narrow range of data in the broadcast, thus saving valuable energy in the device.",
                "The mapping of data with locations and the indexing scheme will be used in our DAYS project to create the push based architecture.",
                "The LBIS has been compared with two other prominent indexing schemes, i.e., the distributed tree indexing scheme and the exponential indexing scheme.",
                "We showed in our simulations that the LBIS scheme has the lowest tuning time for broadcasts having large number of pages, thus saving valuable battery power in the MU. 22 In the future work we try to incorporate pull based architecture in our DAYS project.",
                "Data from the server is available for access by the global users.",
                "This may be done by putting a request to the source server.",
                "The query in this case is a global query.",
                "It is transferred from the users source server to the destination server through the use of LEO satellites.",
                "We intend to use our LDD scheme and data staging architecture in the pull based architecture.",
                "We will show that the LDD scheme together with the data staging architecture significantly improves the latency for global as well as local query. 8.",

                "The mode of data transfer is essentially asymmetric, that is, the capacity of the transfer of data (downstream communication) from the server to the client (mobile user) is significantly larger than the client or mobile user to the server (upstream communication).",
                "The effectiveness of a data dissemination system is judged by its ability to provide user the required data at anywhere and at anytime.",
                "One of the best ways to accomplish this is through the dissemination of highly personalized Location Based Services (LBS) which allows users to access personalized location dependent data.",
                "An example would be someone using their mobile device to search for a vegetarian restaurant.",
                "The LBS application would interact with other location technology components or use the mobile users input to determine the users location and download the information about the restaurants in proximity to the user by tuning into the <br>wireless channel</br> which is disseminating LDD.",
                "We see a limited deployment of LBS by some service providers.",
                "But there are every indications that with time some of the complex technical problems such as uniform location framework, calculating and tracking locations in all types of places, positioning in various environments, innovative location applications, etc., will be resolved and LBS will become a common facility and will help to improve market productivity and customer comfort.",

                "A simple broadcast, however, is likely to cause significant performance degradation in the energy constrained mobile devices and a common solution to this problem is the use of efficient air indexing.",

                "In figure 6 we consider m= 4.",
                "Here we can see that the exponential and the distributed perform almost similarly, though the former seems to perform slightly better as the broadcast length increases.",
                "A very interesting pattern is visible in figure 7.",
                "For smaller broadcast size, the LBIS seems to have larger tuning time than the other two schemes.",
                "But as the length of broadcast increases, it is clearly visible the LBIS outperforms the other two schemes.",
                "The Distributed tree indexing shows similar behavior like the LBIS.",
                "The tuning time in LBIS remains low because the algorithm allows the MU to skip some intermediate Minor Indexes.",
                "This allows the MU to move into lower levels directly after coming into active mode, thus saving valuable energy.",
                "This action is not possible in the distributed tree indexing and hence we can observe that its tuning time is more than the LBIS scheme, although it performs better than the exponential scheme.",
                "Figure 8, in contrast, shows us that the tuning time in LBIS, though less than the other two schemes, tends to increase sharply as the broadcast length becomes greater than the 15000 pages.",
                "This may be attributed both due to increase in time required to scan the intermediate Minor Indexes and the length of the broadcast.",
                "But we can observe that the slope of the LBIS curve is significantly less than the other two curves.",

                "The scheme performs better than the other two schemes in terms of tuning time in most of the cases.",
                "As the length of the broadcast increases, after a certain point, though the tuning time increases as a result of factors which we have described before, the scheme always performs better than the other two schemes.",
                "Due to the prescribed limit of the number of pages in the paper, we are unable to show more results.",
                "But these omitted results show similar trend as the results depicted in figure 5-8. 7.",

                "We have presented a scheme called LBIS to index this LDD.",
                "We have used the containment property of LDD in the scheme that limits the search to a narrow range of data in the broadcast, thus saving valuable energy in the device.",
                "The mapping of data with locations and the indexing scheme will be used in our DAYS project to create the push based architecture.",
                "The LBIS has been compared with two other prominent indexing schemes, i.e., the distributed tree indexing scheme and the exponential indexing scheme.",
                "We showed in our simulations that the LBIS scheme has the lowest tuning time for broadcasts having large number of pages, thus saving valuable battery power in the MU. 22 In the future work we try to incorporate pull based architecture in our DAYS project.",

                "The mode of data transfer is essentially asymmetric, that is, the capacity of the transfer of data (downstream communication) from the server to the client (mobile user) is significantly larger than the client or mobile user to the server (upstream communication).",
                "The effectiveness of a data dissemination system is judged by its ability to provide user the required data at anywhere and at anytime.",
                "One of the best ways to accomplish this is through the dissemination of highly personalized Location Based Services (LBS) which allows users to access personalized location dependent data.",
                "An example would be someone using their mobile device to search for a vegetarian restaurant.",
                "The LBS application would interact with other location technology components or use the mobile users input to determine the users location and download the information about the restaurants in proximity to the user by tuning into the wireless channel which is disseminating LDD.",
                "We see a limited deployment of LBS by some service providers.",
                "But there are every indications that with time some of the complex technical problems such as uniform location framework, calculating and tracking locations in all types of places, positioning in various environments, innovative location applications, etc., will be resolved and LBS will become a common facility and will help to improve market productivity and customer comfort.",
                "In our project called DAYS, we use wireless data broadcast mechanism to push LDD to users and mobile users monitor and tune the channel to find and download the required data.",
                "A simple broadcast, however, is likely to cause significant performance degradation in the energy constrained mobile devices and a common solution to this problem is the use of efficient air indexing.",
                "The indexing approach stores control information which tells the user about the data location in the broadcast and how and when he could access it.",
                "A mobile user, thus, has some free time to go into the doze mode which conserves valuable power.",

                "Two parameters that affect these are the tuning time and the access latency.",

                "Several indexing schemes have been proposed in the past and the prominent among them are the tree based and the exponential indexing schemes [17].",
                "The main disadvantages of the tree based schemes are that they are based on centralized tree structures.",
                "To start a search, the MU has to wait until it reaches the root of the next broadcast tree.",

                "For broadcasts with large number of pages, the exponential scheme has been shown to perform similarly as the tree based schemes in terms of access latency.",
                "Also, the average length of broadcast increases due to the <br>index</br> replication and this may cause significant increase in the access latency.",
                "None of the above indexing schemes is equally effective in broadcasting location dependent data.",
                "In addition to providing low latency, they lack properties which are used to address LDD issues.",

                "Specifically, the <br>index</br> tree is divided into a replicated part and a non replicated part.",
                "Each broadcast consists of the replicated part and the nonreplicated part that indexes the data items immediately following it.",
                "As such, each node in the non-replicated part appears only once in a broadcast and, hence, reduces the replication cost and access latency while achieving a good tuning time.",
                "Chen et al. [2] and Shivakumar et al. [8] considered unbalanced tree structures to optimize energy consumption for non-uniform data access.",

                "The flexible <br>index</br> first sorts the data items in ascending (or descending) order of the search key values and then divides them into p segments.",
                "The first bucket in each data segment contains a control <br>index</br>, which is a binary <br>index</br> mapping a given key value to the segment containing that key, and a local index, which is an m-entry index mapping a given key value to the buckets within the current segment.",
                "By tuning the parameters of p and m, mobile clients can achieve either a good tuning time or good access latency.",
                "Another indexing technique proposed is the exponential indexing scheme [17].",
                "In this scheme, a parameterized <br>index</br>, called the exponential <br>index</br> is used to optimize the access latency or the tuning time.",
                "It facilitates <br>index</br> replication by linking different search trees.",

                "The mode of data transfer is essentially asymmetric, that is, the capacity of the transfer of data (downstream communication) from the server to the client (mobile user) is significantly larger than the client or mobile user to the server (upstream communication).",
                "The effectiveness of a data dissemination system is judged by its ability to provide user the required data at anywhere and at anytime.",
                "One of the best ways to accomplish this is through the dissemination of highly personalized Location Based Services (LBS) which allows users to access personalized location dependent data.",
                "An example would be someone using their mobile device to search for a vegetarian restaurant.",
                "The LBS application would interact with other location technology components or use the mobile users input to determine the users location and download the information about the restaurants in proximity to the user by tuning into the wireless channel which is disseminating LDD.",
                "We see a limited deployment of LBS by some service providers.",
                "But there are every indications that with time some of the complex technical problems such as uniform location framework, calculating and tracking locations in all types of places, positioning in various environments, innovative location applications, etc., will be resolved and LBS will become a common facility and will help to improve market productivity and customer comfort.",
                "In our project called DAYS, we use wireless data broadcast mechanism to push LDD to users and mobile users monitor and tune the channel to find and download the required data.",
                "A simple broadcast, however, is likely to cause significant performance degradation in the energy constrained mobile devices and a common solution to this problem is the use of efficient air indexing.",

                "Two parameters that affect these are the tuning time and the access latency.",
                "Tuning time refers to the time during which the mobile unit (MU) remains in active state to tune the channel and download its required data.",
                "It can also be defined as the number of buckets tuned by the mobile device in active state to get its required data.",
                "Access latency may be defined as the time elapsed since a request has been issued till the response has been received. 1 This research was supported by a grant from NSF IIS-0209170.",
                "Several indexing schemes have been proposed in the past and the prominent among them are the tree based and the exponential indexing schemes [17].",
                "The main disadvantages of the tree based schemes are that they are based on centralized tree structures.",
                "To start a search, the MU has to wait until it reaches the root of the next broadcast tree.",
                "This significantly affects the tuning time of the mobile unit.",
                "The exponential schemes facilitate index replication by sharing links in different search trees.",
                "For broadcasts with large number of pages, the exponential scheme has been shown to perform similarly as the tree based schemes in terms of access latency.",
                "Also, the average length of broadcast increases due to the index replication and this may cause significant increase in the access latency.",
                "None of the above indexing schemes is equally effective in broadcasting location dependent data.",
                "In addition to providing low latency, they lack properties which are used to address LDD issues.",

                "Specifically, the index tree is divided into a replicated part and a non replicated part.",
                "Each broadcast consists of the replicated part and the nonreplicated part that indexes the data items immediately following it.",
                "As such, each node in the non-replicated part appears only once in a broadcast and, hence, reduces the replication cost and access latency while achieving a good tuning time.",

                "The Distributed tree indexing shows similar behavior like the LBIS.",
                "The tuning time in LBIS remains low because the algorithm allows the MU to skip some intermediate Minor Indexes.",

                "Figure 8, in contrast, shows us that the tuning time in LBIS, though less than the other two schemes, tends to increase sharply as the broadcast length becomes greater than the 15000 pages.",
                "This may be attributed both due to increase in time required to scan the intermediate Minor Indexes and the length of the broadcast.",
