Recent research in information markets has resulted in two new designs, market scoring rules and dynamic parimutuel markets. We develop an analytic method to guide the design and strategic analysis of information markets. Our central contribution is a new abstract betting game, the projection game, that serves as a useful model for information markets. We demonstrate that this game can serve as a strategic model of dynamic parimutuel markets, and also captures the essence of the strategies in market scoring rules. The projection game is tractable to analyze, and has an attractive geometric visualization that makes the strategic moves and interactions more transparent. We use it to prove several strategic properties about the dynamic parimutuel market. We also prove that a special form of the projection game is strategically equivalent to the spherical scoring rule, and it is strategically similar to other scoring rules. Finally, we illustrate two applications of the model to analysis of complex strategic scenarios: we analyze the precision of a market in which traders have inertia, and a market in which a trader can profit by manipulating another traders beliefs.

INTRODUCTION Markets have long been used as a medium for trade. As a side effect of trade, the participants in a market reveal something about their preferences and beliefs. For example, in a financial market, agents would buy shares which they think are undervalued, and sell shares which they think are overvalued. It has long been observed that, because the market price is influenced by all the trades taking place, it aggregates the private information of all the traders. Thus, in a situation in which future events are uncertain, and each trader might have a little information, the aggregated information contained in the market prices can be used to predict future events. This has motivated the creation of information markets, which are mechanisms for aggregating the traders information about an uncertain event. Information markets can be modeled as a game in which the participants bet on a number of possible outcomes, such as the results of a presidential election, by buying shares of the outcomes and receiving payoffs when the outcome is realized. As in financial markets, the participants aim to maximize their profit by buying low and selling high. In this way, the players behavior transmits their personal information and beliefs about the possible outcomes, and can be used to predict the event more accurately. The benefit of well-designed information markets goes beyond information aggregation; they can also be used as a hedging instrument, to allow traders to insure against risk. Recently, researchers have turned to the problem of designing market structures specifically to achieve better information aggregation properties than traditional markets. Two designs for information markets have been proposed: the Dynamic Parimutuel Market (DPM) by Pennock [10] and the Market Scoring Rules (MSR) by Hanson [6]. Both the DPM and the MSR were designed with the goal of giving informed traders an incentive to trade, and to reveal their information as soon as possible, while also controlling the subsidy that the market designer needs to pump into the market. The DPM was created as a combination of a pari-mutuel market (which is commonly used for betting on horses) and a continuous double auction, in order to simultaneously obtain the first ones infinite buy-in liquidity and the latters ability to react continuously to new information. One version of the DPM was implemented in the Yahoo! Buzz market [8] to experimentally test the markets prediction properties. The foundations of the MSR lie in the idea of a proper scoring rule, which is a technique to reward forecasters in a way that encourages them to give their best prediction. 316 The innovation in the MSR is to use these scoring rules as instruments that can be traded, thus providing traders who have new information an incentive to trade. The MSR was to be used in a policy analysis market in the Middle East [15], which was subsequently withdrawn. Information markets rely on informed traders trading for their own profit, so it is critical to understand the strategic properties of these markets. This is not an easy task, because markets are complex, and traders can influence each others beliefs through their trades, and hence, can potentially achieve long term gains by manipulating the market. For the MSR, it has been shown that, if we exclude the possibility of achieving gain through misleading other traders, it is optimal for each trader to honestly reflect her private belief in her trades. For the DPM, we are not aware of any prior strategic analysis of this nature; in fact, a strategic hole was discovered while testing the DPM in the Yahoo! Buzz market [8]. 1.1 Our Results In this paper, we seek to develop an analytic method to guide the design and strategic analysis of information markets. Our central contribution is a new abstract betting game, the projection 1 game, that serves as a useful model for information markets. The projection game is conceptually simpler than the MSR and DPM, and thus it is easier to analyze. In addition it has an attractive geometric visualization, which makes the strategic moves and interactions more transparent. We present an analysis of the optimal strategies and profits in this game. We then undertake an analysis of traders costs and profits in the dynamic parimutuel market. Remarkably, we find that the cost of a sequence of trades in the DPM is identical to the cost of the corresponding moves in the projection game. Further, if we assume that the traders beliefs at the end of trading match the true probability of the event being predicted, the traders payoffs and profits in the DPM are identical to their payoffs and profits in a corresponding projection game. We use the equivalence between the DPM and the projection game to prove that the DPM is arbitrage-free, deduce profitable strategies in the DPM, and demonstrate that constraints on the agents trades are necessary to prevent a strategic breakdown. We also prove an equivalence between the projection game and the MSR: We show that play in the MSR is strategically equivalent to play in a restricted projection game, at least for myopic strategies and small trades. In particular, the profitability of any move under the spherical scoring rule is exactly proportional to the profitability of the corresponding move in the projection game restricted to a circle, with slight distortion of the prior probabilities. This allows us to use the projection game as a conceptual model for market scoring rules. We note that while the MSR with the spherical scoring rule somewhat resembles the projection game, due to the mathematical similarity of their profit expressions, the DPM model is markedly different and thus its equivalence to the projection game is especially striking. Further, because the restricted projection game corresponds to a DPM with a natural trading constraint, this sheds light on an intriguing connection between the MSR and the DPM. 1 In an earlier version of this paper, we called this the segment game. Lastly, we illustrate how the projection game model can be used to analyze the potential for manipulation of information markets for long-term gain.2 We present an example scenario in which such manipulation can occur, and suggest additional rules that might mitigate the possibility of manipulation. We also illustrate another application to analyzing how a market maker can improve the prediction accuracy of a market in which traders will not trade unless their expected profit is above a threshold. 1.2 Related Work Numerous studies have demonstrated empirically that market prices are good predictors of future events, and seem to aggregate the collected wisdom of all the traders [2, 3, 12, 1, 5, 16]. This effect has also been demonstrated in laboratory studies [13, 14], and has theoretical support in the literature of rational expectations [9]. A number of recent studies have addressed the design of the market structure and trading rules for information markets, as well as the incentive to participate and other strategic issues. The two papers most closely related to our work are the papers by Hanson [6] and Pennock [10]. However, strategic issues in information markets have also been studied by Mangold et al. [8] and by Hanson, Oprea and Porter [7]. An upcoming survey paper [11] discusses costfunction formulations of automated market makers. Organization of the paper The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the projection game, and analyze the players costs, profits, and optimal strategies in this game. In Section 3, we study the dynamic parimutuel market, and show that trade in a DPM is equivalent to a projection game. We establish a connection between the projection game and the MSR in Section 4. In Section 5, we illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze non-myopic, and potentially manipulative, actions. We present our conclusions, and suggestions for future work, in Section 6. 2. THE PROJECTION GAME In this section, we describe an abstract betting game, the projection game; in the following sections, we will argue that both the MSR and the DPM are strategically similar to the projection game. The projection game is conceptually simpler than MSR and DPM, and hence should prove easier to analyze. For clarity of exposition, here and in the rest of the paper we assume the space is two dimensional, i.e., there are only two possible events. Our results easily generalize to more than two dimensions. We also assume throughout that players are risk-neutral. Suppose there are two mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, A and B. (In other words, B is the same as not A.) There are n agents who may have information about the likelihood of A and B, and we (the designers) would like to aggregate their information. We invite them to play the game described below: At any point in the game, there is a current state described by a pair of parameters, (x, y), which we sometimes write in vector form as x. Intuitively, x corresponds to the 2 Here, we are referring only to manipulation of the information market for later gain from the market itself; we do not consider the possibility of traders having vested interests in the underlying events. 317 total holding of shares in A, and y corresponds to the holding of shares in B. In each move of the game, one player (say i) plays an arrow (or segment) from (x, y) to (x , y ). We use the notation [(x, y) â†’ (x , y )] or [x, x ] to denote this move. The game starts at (0, 0), but the market maker makes the first move; without loss of generality, we can assume the move is to (1, 1). All subsequent moves are made by players, in an arbitrary (and potentially repeating) sequence. Each move has a cost associated with it, given by C[x, x ] = |x | âˆ’ |x|, where | Â· | denotes the Euclidean norm, |x| = p x2 + y2. Note that none of the variables are constrained to be nonnegative, and hence, the cost of a move can be negative. The cost can be expressed in an alternative form, that is also useful. Suppose player i moves from (x, y) to (x , y ). We can write (x , y ) as (x + lex, y + ley), such that l â‰¥ 0 and |ex|2 + |ey|2 = 1. We call l the volume of the move, and (ex, ey) the direction of the move. At any point (Ë†x, Ë†y), there is an instantaneous price charged, defined as follows: c((Ë†x, Ë†y), (ex, ey)) = Ë†xex + Ë†yey |(Ë†x, Ë†y)| = Ë†x Â· e |Ë†x| . Note that the price depends only on the angle between the line joining the vector (Ë†x, Ë†y) and the segment [(x, y), (x , y )], and not the lengths. The total cost of the move is the price integrated over the segment [(x, y) â†’ (x , y )], i.e., C[(x, y) â†’ (x , y )] = Z l w=0 c((x+wex, y +wey), (ex, ey))dw We assume that the game terminates after a finite number of moves. At the end of the game, the true probability p of event A is determined, and the agents receive payoffs for the moves they made. Let q = (qx, qy) = (p,1âˆ’p) |(p,1âˆ’p)| . The payoff to agent i for a segment [(x, y) â†’ (x , y )] is given by: P([(x, y) â†’ (x , y )]) = qx(x âˆ’ x) + qy(y âˆ’ y) = q.(x âˆ’ x) We call the line through the origin with slope (1 âˆ’ p)/p = qy/qx the p-line. Note that the payoff, too, may be negative. One drawback of the definition of a projection game is that implementing the payoffs requires us to know the actual probability p. This is feasible if the probability can eventually be determined statistically, such as when predicting the relative frequency of different recurring events, or vote shares. It is also feasible for one-off events in which there is reason to believe that the true probability is either 0 or 1. For other one-off events, it cannot be implemented directly (unlike scoring rules, which can be implemented in expectation). However, we believe that even in these cases, the projection game can be useful as a conceptual and analytical tool. The moves, costs and payoffs have a natural geometric representation, which is shown in Figure 1 for three players with one move each. The players append directed line segments in turn, and the payoff player i finally receives for a move is the projection of her segment onto the line with slope (1 âˆ’ p)/p. Her cost is the difference of distances of the endpoints of her move to the origin. 2.1 Strategicproperties oftheprojectiongame We begin our strategic analysis of the projection game by observing the following simple path-independence property. 1âˆ’p p 3s m ove 1s payoff M M m ove 1s move 2smove 3s payoff 2s payoff x y Figure 1: A projection game with three players Lemma 1. [Path-Independence] Suppose there is a sequence of moves leading from (x, y) to (x , y ). Then, the total cost of all the moves is equal to the cost of the single move [(x, y) â†’ (x , y )], and the total payoff of all the moves is equal to the payoff of the single move [(x, y) â†’ (x , y )]. Proof. The proof follows trivially from the definition of the costs and payoffs: If we consider a path from point x to point x , both the net change in the vector lengths and the net projection onto the p-line are completely determined by x and x . Although simple, path independence of profits is vitally important, because it implies (and is implied by) the absence of arbitrage in the market. In other words, there is no sequence of moves that start and end at the same point, but result in a positive profit. On the other hand, if there were two paths from (x, y) to (x , y ) with different profits, there would be a cyclic path with positive profit. For ease of reference, we summarize some more useful properties of the cost and payoff functions in the projection game. Lemma 2. 1. The instantaneous price for moving along a line through the origin is 1 or âˆ’1, when the move is away or toward the origin respectively. The instantaneous price along a circle centered at the origin is 0. 2. When x moves along a circle centered at the origin to point Â¯x on the positive p-line, the corresponding payoff is P(x, Â¯x) = |x| âˆ’ x Â· q, and the cost is C[x, Â¯x] = 0. 3. The two cost function formulations are equivalent: C[x, x ] = Z l w=0 cos(x + we, e)dw = |x |âˆ’|x| âˆ€x, x , where e is the unit vector giving the direction of move. In addition, when x moves along the positive p-line, the payoff is equal to the cost, P(x, x ) = |x | âˆ’ |x|. Proof. 1. The instantaneous price is c(x, e) = x Â· e/|x| = cos(x, e), where e is the direction of movement, and the result follows. 2. Since Â¯x is on the positive p-line, qÂ·Â¯x = |Â¯x| = |x|, hence P(x, Â¯x) = q Â· (Â¯x âˆ’ x) = |x| âˆ’ x Â· q; the cost is 0 from the definition. 318 3. From Part 1, the cost of moving from x to the origin is C[x, 0] = Z l w=0 cos(x + we, e)dw = Z l w=0 (âˆ’1)dw = âˆ’|x|, where l = |x|, e = x/|x|. By the path-independence property, C[x, x ] = C[x, 0] + C[0, x ] = |x | âˆ’ |x|. Finally, a point on the positive p-line gets projected to itself, namely q Â· x = |x| so when the movement is along the positive p-line, P(x, x ) = q Â· (x âˆ’ x) = |x | âˆ’ |x| = C[x, x ]. We now consider the question of which moves are profitable in this game. The eventual profit of a move [x, x ], where x = x + l.(ex, ey), is profit[x, x ] = P[x, x ] âˆ’ C[x, x ] = lq.e âˆ’ C[x, x ] Differentiating with respect to l, we get d(profit) dl = q.e âˆ’ c(x + le, e) = q.e âˆ’ x + le |x + le| .e We observe that this is 0 if p(y + ley) = (1 âˆ’ p)(x + lex), in other words, when the vectors q and (x + le) are exactly aligned. Further, we observe that the price is non-decreasing with increasing l. Thus, along the direction e, the profit is maximized at the point of intersection with the p-line. By Lemma 2, there is always a path from x to the positive p-line with 0 cost, which is given by an arc of the circle with center at the origin and radius |x|. Also, any movement along the p-line has 0 additional profit. Thus, for any point x, we can define the profit potential Ï†(x, p) by Ï†(x, p) = |x| âˆ’ x Â· q. Note, the potential is positive for x off the positive p-line and zero for x on the line. Next we show that a move to a lower potential is always profitable. Lemma 3. The profit of a move [x, x ] is equal to the difference in potential Ï†(x, p) âˆ’ Ï†(x , p). Proof. Denote z = |x|q and z = |x |q, i.e., these are the points of intersection of the positive p-line with the circles centered at the origin with radii |x| and |x | respectively. By the path-independence property and Lemma 2, the profit of move [x, x ] is profit(x, x ) = profit(x, z) + profit(z, z ) + profit(z , x ) = (|x| âˆ’ x Â· q) + 0 + (x Â· q âˆ’ |x |) = Ï†(x, p) âˆ’ Ï†(x , p). Thus, the profit of the move is equal to the change in profit potential between the endpoints. This lemma offers another way of seeing that it is optimal to move to the point of lowest potential, namely to the p-line. p y 1âˆ’p x x x z z profit = |x|âˆ’x.q profit = x.qâˆ’|x| profit = 0 Figure 2: The profit of move [x, x ] is equal to the change in profit potential from x to x . 3. DYNAMIC PARIMUTUEL MARKETS The dynamic parimutuel market (DPM) was introduced by Pennock [10] as an information market structure that encourages informed traders to trade early, has guaranteed liquidity, and requires a bounded subsidy. This market structure was used in the Yahoo! Buzz market [8]. In this section, we show that the dynamic parimutuel market is also remarkably similar to the projection game. Coupled with section 4, this also demonstrates a strong connection between the DPM and MSR. In a two-event DPM, users can place bets on either event A or B at any time, by buying a share in the appropriate event. The price of a share is variable, determined by the total amount of money in the market and the number of shares currently outstanding. Further, existing shares can be sold at the current price. After it is determined which event really happens, the shares are liquidated for cash. In the total-money-redistributed variant of DPM, which is the variant used in the Yahoo! market, the total money is divided equally among the shares of the winning event; shares of the losing event are worthless. Note that the payoffs are undefined if the event has zero outstanding shares; the DPM rules should preclude this possibility. We use the following notation: Let x be the number of outstanding shares of A (totalled over all traders), and y be the number of outstanding shares in B. Let M denote the total money currently in the market. Let cA and cB denote the prices of shares in A and B respectively. The price of a share in the Yahoo! DPM is determined by the share-ratio principle: cA cB = x y (1) The form of the prices can be fully determined by stipulating that, for any given value of M, x, and y, there must be some probability pA such that, if a trader believes that pA is the probability that A will occur and the market will liquidate in the current state, she cannot expect to profit from either buying or selling either share. This gives us cA = pA hM x i cB = pB hM y i 319 Since pA + pB = 1, we have: xcA + ycB = M (2) Finally, combining Equations 1 and 2, we get cA = x M x2 + y2 cB = y M x2 + y2 Cost of a trade in the DPM Consider a trader who comes to a DPM in state (M, x, y), and buys or sells shares such that the eventual state is (M , x , y ). What is the net cost, M âˆ’ M, of her move? Theorem 4. The cost of the move from (x, y) to (x , y ) is M âˆ’ M = M0[ p x 2 + y 2 âˆ’ p x2 + y2] for some constant M0. In other words, it is a constant multiple of the corresponding cost in the projection game. Proof. Consider the function G(x, y) = M0[ p x2 + y2]. The function G is differentiable for all x, y = 0, and its partial derivatives are: âˆ‚G âˆ‚x = M0[ x p x2 + y2 ] = x G(x, y) x2 + y2 âˆ‚G âˆ‚y = M0[ y p x2 + y2 ] = y G(x, y) x2 + y2 Now, compare these equations to the prices in the DPM, and observe that, as a trader buys or sells in the DPM, the instantaneous price is the derivative of the money. It follows that, if at any point of time the DPM is in a state (M, x, y) such that M = G(x, y), then, at all subsequent points of time, the state (M , x , y ) of the DPM will satisfy M = G(x , y ). Finally, note that we can pick the constant M0 such that the equation is satisfied for the initial state of the DPM, and hence, it will always be satisfied. One important consequence of Theorem 4 is that the dynamic parimutuel market is arbitrage-free (using Lemma 1). It is interesting to note that the original Yahoo! Buzz market used a different pricing rule, which did permit arbitrage; the price rule was changed to the share-ratio rule after traders started exploiting the arbitrage opportunities [8]. Another somewhat surprising consequence is that the numbers of outstanding shares x, y completely determines the total capitalization M of the DPM. Constraints in the DPM Although it might seem, based on the costs, that any move in the projection game has an equivalent move in the DPM, the DPM places some constraints on trades. Firstly, no trader is allowed to have a net negative holding in either share. This is important, because it ensures that the total holdings in each share are always positive. However, this is a boundary constraint, and does not impact the strategic choices for a player with a sufficiently large positive holding in each share. Thus, we can ignore this constraint from a first-order strategic analysis of the DPM. Secondly, for practical reasons a DPM will probably have a minimum unit of trade, but we assume here that arbitrarily small quantities can be traded. Payoffs in the DPM At some point, trading in the DPM ceases and shares are liquidated. We assume here that the true probability becomes known at liquidation time, and describe the payoffs in terms of the probability; however, if the probability is not revealed, only the event that actually occurs, these payoffs can be implemented in expectation. Suppose the DPM terminates in a state (M, x, y), and the true probability of event A is p. When the dynamic parimutuel market is liquidated, the shares are paid off in the following way: Each owner of a share of A receives pM x , and each owner of a share of B receives (1 âˆ’ p)M y , for each share owned. The payoffs in the DPM, although given by a fairly simple form, are conceptually complex, because the payoff of a move depends on the subsequent moves before the market liquidates. Thus, a fully rational choice of move in the DPM for player i should take into account the actions of subsequent players, including player i himself. Here, we restrict the analysis to myopic, infinitesimal strategies: Given the market position is (M, x, y), in which direction should a player make an infinitesimal move in order to maximize her profit? We show that the infinitesimal payoffs and profits of a DPM with true probability p correspond strategically to the infinitesimal payoffs and profits of a projection game with odds p p/(1 âˆ’ p), in the following sense: Lemma 5. Suppose player i is about to make a move in a dynamic parimutuel market in a state (M, x, y), and the true probability of event A is p. Then, assuming the market is liquidated after is move, â€¢ If x y < q p 1âˆ’p , player i profits by buying shares in A , or selling shares in B. â€¢ If x y > q p 1âˆ’p , player i profits by selling shares in A, or buying shares in B. Proof. Consider the cost and payoff of buying a small quantity Î”x of shares in A. The cost is C[(x, y) â†’ (x + Î”x, y)] = Î”x Â· x M x2+y2 , and the payoff is Î”x Â· pM x . Thus, buying the shares is profitable iff Î”x Â· x M x2 + y2 < Î”x Â· p M x â‡” x2 x2 + y2 < p â‡” x2 + y2 x2 > 1 p â‡” 1 + ( y x )2 > 1 p â‡” y x > r 1 âˆ’ p p â‡” x y < r p 1 âˆ’ p Thus, buying A is profitable if x y < q p 1âˆ’p , and selling A is profitable if x y > q p 1âˆ’p . The analysis for buying or selling B is similar, with p and (1 âˆ’ p) interchanged. It follows from Lemma 5 that it is myopically profitable for players to move towards the line with slope q 1âˆ’p p . Note that there is a one-to-one mapping between 1âˆ’p p and q 1âˆ’p p 320 in their respective ranges, so this line is uniquely defined, and each such line also corresponds to a unique p. However, because the actual payoff of a move depends on the future moves, players must base their decisions on some belief about the final state of the market. In the light of Lemma 5, one natural, rational-expectation style assumption is that the final state (M, xâˆ— , yâˆ— ) will satisfy xâˆ— yâˆ— = q p 1âˆ’p . (In other words, one might assume that the traders beliefs will ultimately converge to the true probability p; knowing p, the traders will drive the market state to satisfy x y = q p 1âˆ’p .) This is very plausible in markets (such as the Yahoo! Buzz market) in which trading is permitted right until the market is liquidated, at which point there is no remaining uncertainty about the relevant frequencies. Under this assumption, we can prove an even tighter connection between payoffs in the DPM (where the true probability is p) and payoffs in the projection game, with odds q p 1âˆ’p : Theorem 6. Suppose that the DPM ultimately terminates in a state (M, X, Y ) satisfying X Y = q p 1âˆ’p . Assume without loss of generality that the constant M0 = 1, so M =âˆš X2 + Y 2. Then, the final payoff for any move [x â†’ x ] made in the course of trading is (x âˆ’ x) Â· ( âˆš p, âˆš 1 âˆ’ p), i.e., it is the same as the payoff in the projection game with oddsq p 1âˆ’p . Proof. First, observe that X M = âˆš p and Y M = âˆš 1 âˆ’ p. The final payoff is the liquidation value of (x âˆ’ x) shares of A and (y âˆ’ y) shares of B, which is PayoffDP M [x âˆ’ x] = p M X (x âˆ’ x) + (1 âˆ’ p) M Y (y âˆ’ y) = p 1 âˆš p (x âˆ’ x) + (1 âˆ’ p) 1 âˆš 1 âˆ’ p (y âˆ’ y) = âˆš p(x âˆ’ x) + p 1 âˆ’ p(y âˆ’ y). Strategic Analysis for the DPM Theorems 4 and 6 give us a very strong equivalence between the projection game and the dynamic parimutuel market, under the assumption that the DPM converges to the optimal value for the true probability. A player playing in a DPM with true odds p/(1 âˆ’ p), can imagine himself playing in the projection game with odds q p 1âˆ’p , because both the costs and the payoffs of any given move are identical. Using this equivalence, we can transfer all the strategic properties proven for the projection game directly to the analysis of the dynamic parimutuel market. One particularly interesting conclusion we can draw is as follows: In the absence of any constraint that disallows it, it is always profitable for an agent to move towards the origin, by selling shares in both A and B while maintaining the ratio x/y. In the DPM, this is limited by forbidding short sales, so players can never have negative holdings in either share. As a result, when their holding in one share (say A) is 0, they cant use the strategy of moving towards the origin. We can conclude that a rational player should never hold shares of both A and B simultaneously, regardless of her beliefs and the market position. This discussion leads us to consider a modified DPM, in which this strategic loophole is addressed directly: Instead of disallowing all short sales, we place a constraint that no agent ever reduce the total market capitalization M (or, alternatively, that any agents total investment in the market is always non-negative). We call this the nondecreasing market capitalization constraint for the DPM. This corresponds to a restriction that no move in the projection game reduces the radius. However, we can conclude from the preceding discussion that players have no incentive to ever increase the radius. Thus, the moves of the projection game would all lie on the quarter circle in the positive quadrant, with radius determined by the market makers move. In section 4, we show that the projection game on this quarter circle is strategically equivalent (at least myopically) to trade in a Market Scoring Rule. Thus, the DPM and MSR appear to be deeply connected to each other, like different interfaces to the same underlying game. 4. MARKET SCORING RULES The Market Scoring Rule (MSR) was introduced by Hanson [6]. It is based on the concept of a proper scoring rule, a technique which rewards forecasters to give their best prediction. Hansons innovation was to turn the scoring rules into instruments that can be traded, thereby providing traders who have new information an incentive to trade. One positive effect of this design is that a single trader would still have incentive to trade, which is equivalent to updating the scoring rule report to reflect her information, thereby eliminating the problem of thin markets and illiquidity. In this section, we show that, when the scoring rule used is the spherical scoring rule [4], there is a strong strategic equivalence between the projection game and the market scoring rule. Proper scoring rules are tools used to reward forecasters who predict the probability distribution of an event. We describe this in the simple setting of two exhaustive, mutually exclusive events A and B. In the simple setting of two exhaustive, mutually exclusive events A and B, proper scoring rules are defined as follows. Suppose the forecaster predicts that the probabilities of the events are r = (rA, rB), with rA + rB = 1. The scoring rule is specified by functions sA(rA, rB) and sB(rA, rB), which are applied as follows: If the event A occurs, the forecaster is paid sA(rA, rB), and if the event B occurs, the forecaster is paid sB(rA, rB). The key property that a proper scoring rule satisfies is that the expected payment is maximized when the report is identical to the true probability distribution. 4.1 Equivalence with Spherical Scoring Rule In this section, we focus on one specific scoring rule: the spherical scoring rule [4]. Definition 1. The spherical scoring rule [4] is defined by si(r) def = ri/||r||. For two events, this can be written as: sA(rA, rB) = rA p r2 A + r2 B ; sB(rA, rB) = rB p r2 A + r2 B The spherical scoring rule is known to be a proper scoring rule. The definition generalizes naturally to higher dimensions. We now demonstrate a close connection between the projection game restricted to a circular arc and a market scoring rule that uses the spherical scoring rule. At this point, it is 321 convenient to use vector notation. Let x = (x, y) denote a position in the projection game. We consider the projection game restricted to the circle |x| = 1. Restricted projection game Consider a move in this restricted projection game from x to x . Recall that q = ( p âˆš p2+(1âˆ’p)2 , 1âˆ’p âˆš p2+(1âˆ’p)2 ), where p is the true probability of the event. Then, the projection game profit of a move [x, x ] is q Â· [x âˆ’ x] (noting that |x| = |x |). We can extend this to an arbitrary collection3 of (not necessarily contiguous) moves X = {[x1, x1], [x2, x2], Â· Â· Â· , [xl, xl]}. SEG-PROFITp(X ) = X [x,x ]âˆˆX q Â· [x âˆ’ x] = q Â· 2 4 X [x,x ]âˆˆX [x âˆ’ x] 3 5 Spherical scoring rule profit We now turn our attention to the MSR with the spherical scoring rule (SSR). Consider a player who changes the report from r to r . Then, if the true probability of A is p, her expected profit is SSR-PROFIT([r, r ]) = p(sA(r )âˆ’sA(r))+(1âˆ’p)(sB(r )âˆ’sB(r)) Now, let us represent the initial and final position in terms of circular coordinates. For r = (rA, rB), define the corresponding coordinates x = ( rAâˆš r2 A+r2 B , rBâˆš r2 A+r2 B ). Note that the coordinates satisfy |x| = 1, and thus correspond to valid coordinates for the restricted projection game. Now, let p denote the vector [p, 1 âˆ’ p]. Then, expanding the spherical scoring functions sA, sB, the players profit for a move from r to r can be rewritten in terms of the corresponding coordinates x, x as: SSR-PROFIT([x, x ]) = p Â· (x âˆ’ x) For any collection X of moves, the total payoff in the SSR market is given by: SSR-PROFITp(X ) = X [x,x ]âˆˆX p Â· [x âˆ’ x] = p Â· 2 4 X [x,x ]âˆˆX [x âˆ’ x] 3 5 Finally, we note that p and q are related by q = Î¼pp, where Î¼p = 1/ p p2 + (1 âˆ’ p)2 is a scalar that depends only on p. This immediately gives us the following strong strategic equivalence for the restricted projection game and the SSR market: Theorem 7. Any collection of moves X yields a positive (negative) payoff in the restricted projection game iff X yields a positive (negative) payoff in the Spherical Scoring Rule market. Proof. As derived above, SEG-PROFITp(X ) = Î¼pSSR-PROFITp(X ). For all p, 1 â‰¤ Î¼p â‰¤ âˆš 2, (or more generally for an ndimensional probability vector p, 1 â‰¤ Î¼p = 1 |p| â‰¤ âˆš n, by the arithmetic mean-root mean square inequality), and the result follows immediately. 3 We allow the collection to contain repeated moves, i.e., it is a multiset. Although theorem 7 is stated in terms of the sign of the payoff, it extends to relative payoffs of two collections of moves: Corollary 8. Consider any two collections of moves X , X . Then, X yields a greater payoff than X in the projection game iff X yields a greater payment than X in the SSR market. Proof. Every move [x, x ] has a corresponding inverse move [x , x]. In both the projection game and the SSR, the inverse move profit is simply the negative profit of the move (the moves are reversible). We can define a collection of moves X = X âˆ’ X by adding the inverse of X to X . Note that SEG-PROFITp(X ) = SEG-PROFITp(X )âˆ’SEG-PROFITp(X ) and SSR-PROFITp(X ) = SSR-PROFITp(X )âˆ’SSR-PROFITp(X ); applying theorem 7 completes the proof. It follows that the ex post optimality of a move (or set of moves) is the same in both the projection game and the SSR market. On its own, this strong ex post equivalence is not completely satisfying, because in any non-trivial game there is uncertainty about the value of p, and the different scaling ratios for different p could lead to different ex ante optimal behavior. We can extend the correspondence to settings with uncertain p, as follows: Theorem 9. Consider the restricted projection game with some prior probability distribution F over possible values of p. Then, there is a probability distribution G with the same support as F, and a strictly positive constant c that depends only on F such that: â€¢ (i) For any collection X of moves, the expected profits are related by: EF (SEG-PROFIT(X )) = cEG(SSR-PROFIT(X )) â€¢ (ii) For any collection X , and any measurable information set I âŠ† [0, 1], the expected profits conditioned on knowing that p âˆˆ I satisfy EF (SEG-PROFIT(X )|p âˆˆ I) = cEG(SSR-PROFIT(X )|p âˆˆ I) The converse also holds: For any probability distribution G, there is a distribution F such that both these statements are true. Proof. For simplicity, assume that F has a density function f. (The result holds even for non-continuous distributions). Then, let c = R 1 0 Î¼pf(p)dp. Define the density function g of distribution G by g(p) = Î¼pf(p) c Now, for a collection of moves X , EF (SEG-PROFIT(X )) = Z SEG-PROFITp(X )f(p)dp = Z SSR-PROFITp(X )Î¼pf(p)dp = Z SSR-PROFITp(X )cg(p)dp = cEG(SSR-PROFIT(X )) 322 âˆ’1 âˆ’0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 âˆ’1 âˆ’0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x y log scoring rule quadratic scoring rule Figure 3: Sample score curves for the log scoring rule si(r) = ai + b log ri and the quadratic scoring rule si(r) = ai + b(2ri âˆ’ P k r2 k). To prove part (ii), we simply restrict the integral to values in I. The converse follows similarly by constructing F from G. Analysis of MSR strategies Theorem 9 provides the foundation for analysis of strategies in scoring rule markets. To the extent that strategies in these markets are independent of the specific scoring rule used, we can use the spherical scoring rule as the market instrument. Then, analysis of strategies in the projection game with a slightly distorted distribution over p can be used to understand the strategic properties of the original market situation. Implementation in expectation Another important consequence of Theorem 9 is that the restricted projection game can be implemented with a small distortion in the probability distribution over values of p, by using a Spherical Scoring Rule to implement the payoffs. This makes the projection game valuable as a design tool; for example, we can analyze new constraints and rules in the projection game, and then implement them via the SSR. Unfortunately, the result does not extend to unrestricted projection games, because the relative profit of moving along the circle versus changing radius is not preserved through this transformation. However, it is possible to extend the transformation to projection games in which the radius ri after the ith move is a fixed function of i (not necessarily constant), so that it is not within the strategic control of the player making the move; such games can also be strategically implemented via the spherical scoring rule (with distortion of priors). 4.2 Connection to other scoring rules In this section, we show a weaker similarity between the projection game and the MSR with other scoring rules. We prove an infinitesimal similarity between the restricted projection game and the MSR with log scoring rule; the result generalizes to all proper scoring rules that have a unique local and global maximum. A geometric visualization of some common scoring rules in two dimensions is depicted in Figure 3. The score curves in the figure are defined by {(s1(r), s2(r)) | r = (r, 1 âˆ’ r), r âˆˆ [0, 1]}. Similarly to the projection game, define the profit potential of a probability r in MSR to be the change in profit for moving from r to the optimum p, Ï†MSR(s(r), p) = profitMSR[s(r), s(p)]. We will show that the profit potentials in the two games have analogous roles for analyzing the optimal strategies, in particular both potential functions have a global minimum 0 at r = p. Theorem 10. Consider the projection game restricted to the non-negative unit circle where strategies x have the natural one-to-one correspondence to probability distributions r = (r, 1 âˆ’ r) given by x = ( r |r| , 1âˆ’r |r| ). Trade in a log market scoring rule is strategically similar to trade in the projection game on the quarter-circle, in that d dr Ï†(s(r), p) < 0 for r < p d dr Ï†(s(r), p) > 0 for r > p, both for the projection game and MSR potentials Ï†(.). Proof. (sketch) The derivative of the MSR potential is d dr Ï†(s(r), p) = âˆ’p Â· d dr s(r) = âˆ’ X i pisi(r). For the log scoring rule si(r) = ai + b log ri with b > 0, d dr Ï†MSR(s(r), p) = âˆ’p Â· b r , âˆ’ b 1 âˆ’ r = âˆ’b p r âˆ’ 1 âˆ’ p 1 âˆ’ r = b r âˆ’ p r(1 âˆ’ r) . Since r = (r, 1 âˆ’ r) is a probability distribution, this expression is positive for r > p and negative for r < p as desired. Now, consider the projection game on the non-negative unit circle. The potential for any x = ( r |r| , 1âˆ’r |r| ) is given by Ï†(x(r), p) = |x| âˆ’ q Â· x(r), It is easy to show that d dr Ï†(x(r), p) < 0 for r < p and the derivative is positive for r > p, so the potential function along the circle is decreasing and then increasing with r similarly to an energy function, with a global minimum at r = p, as desired. Theorem 10 establishes that the market log-scoring rule is strategically similar to the projection game played on a circle, in the sense that the optimal direction of movement at the current state is the same in both games. For example, if the current state is r < p, it is profitable to move to r+dr since the effective profit of that move is profit(r, r ) = Ï†(s(r), p) âˆ’ Ï†(s(r + dr), p) > 0. Although stated for logscoring rules, the theorem holds for any scoring rules that induce a potential with a unique local and global minimum at p, such as the quadratic scoring rule and others. 5. USING THEPROJECTION-GAMEMODEL The chief advantages of the projection game are that it is analytically tractable, and also easy to visualize. In Section 3, we used the projection-game model of the DPM to prove the absence of arbitrage, and to infer strategic properties that might have been difficult to deduce otherwise. In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about more complex strategic settings. 323 5.1 Traders with inertia The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the market forms we have studied asserts that traders who disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to trade in the market. The expected gain may, however, be very small. A plausible model of real trader behavior might include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than some constant . We do not attempt to justify this model here; rather, we illustrate how the projection game may be used to analyze such situations, and shed some light on how to modify the trading rules to alleviate this problem. Consider the simple projection game restricted to a circular arc with unit radius; as we have seen, this corresponds closely to the spherical market scoring rule, and to the dynamic parimutuel market under a reasonable constraint. Now, suppose the market probability is p, and a trader believes the true probability is p . Then, his expected gain can be calculated, as follows: Let q and q be the unit vectors in the directions of p and p respectively. The expected profit is given by E = Ï†(q, p ) = 1âˆ’ q Â·q . Thus, the trader will trade only if 1âˆ’qÂ·q > . If we let Î¸ and Î¸ be the angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis), we get E = 1 âˆ’ cos(Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ ); when Î¸ is close to Î¸ , a Taylor series approximation gives us that E â‰ˆ (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )2 /2. Thus, we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy: The market price will not change as long as (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )2 â‰¤ 2 . Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market. One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant. This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy. However, it will also increase the market-makers exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this. The projection game model suggests a natural approach to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds on the market makers loss. The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move. Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1. Then, the traders expected profit would be E = r(1 âˆ’ cos(Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )). Using the same approximation as above, the trader would trade as long as (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )2 > 2 /r. Now, even if the market maker seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase with every trade. 5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not consider the impact of their trades on other traders beliefs. In practice, an informed trader can potentially profit by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders, in a way that allows her to profit later. In this section, we illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze an instance of this phenomenon, and to design market rules that mitigate this effect. The scenario we consider is as follows. There are two traders speculating on the probability of an event E, who each get a 1-bit signal. The optimal probability for each 2bit signal pair is as follows. If trader 1 gets the signal 0, and trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal probability is 0.3. If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is 0.9. If trader 1 gets 1, and trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal probability is 0.7. If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is 0.1. (Note that the impact of trader 2s signal is in a different direction, depending on trader 1s signal). Suppose that the prior distribution of the signals is that trader 1 is equally likely to get a 0 or a 1, but trader 2 gets a 0 with probability 0.55 and a 1 with probability 0.45. The traders are playing the projection game restricted to a circular arc. This setup is depicted in Figure 4. A B D C X Y Signals Opt. Pt 00 C D11 10 01 Event does not happenEventhappens B A Figure 4: Example illustrating non-myopic deception Suppose that, for some exogenous reason, trader 1 has the opportunity to trade, followed by trader 2. Then, trader 1 has the option of placing a last-minute trade just before the market closes. If traders were playing their myopically optimal strategies, here is how the market should run: If trader 1 sees a 0, he would move to some point Y that is between A and C, but closer to C. Trader 2 would then infer that trader 1 received a 0 signal and move to A or C if she got 1 or 0 respectively. Trader 1 has no reason to move again. If trader 1 had got a 1, he would move to a different point X instead, and trader 2 would move to D if she saw 1 and B if she saw 0. Again, trader 1 would not want to move again. Using the projection game, it is easy to show that, if traders consider non-myopic strategies, this set of strategies is not an equilibrium. The exact position of the points does not matter; all we need is the relative position, and the observation that, because of the perfect symmetry in the setup, segments XY, BC, and AD are all parallel to each other. Now, suppose trader 1 got a 0. He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1. Then, when trader 2 moved to, say, D, trader 1 could correct the rating to A. To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to playing two additional moves over trader 1s myopic strategy of moving to Y . The first move, Y X may either move toward or away from the optimal final position. The second move, DA or BC, is always in the correct direction. Further, because DA and BC are longer than XY , and parallel to XY , their projection on the final p-line will always be greater 324 in absolute value than the projection of XY , regardless of what the true p-line is! Thus, the deception would result in a strictly higher expected profit for trader 1. Note that this problem is not specific to the projection game form: Our equivalence results show that it could arise in the MSR or DPM (perhaps with a different prior distribution and different numerical values). Observe also that a strategy profile in which neither trader moved in the first two rounds, and trader 1 moved to either X or Y would be a subgame-perfect equilibrium in this setup. We suggest that one approach to mitigating this problem might be by reducing the radius at every move. This essentially provides a form of discounting that motivates trader 1 to take his profit early rather than mislead trader 2. Graphically, the right reduction factor would make the segments AD and BC shorter than XY (as they are chords on a smaller circle), thus making the myopic strategy optimal. 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented a simple geometric game, the projection game, that can serve as a model for strategic behavior in information markets, as well as a tool to guide the design of new information markets. We have used this model to analyze the cost, profit, and strategies of a trader in a dynamic parimutuel market, and shown that both the dynamic parimutuel market and the spherical market scoring rule are strategically equivalent to the restricted projection game under slight distortion of the prior probabilities. The general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit. In section 5, however, we analyze a small example market without this assumption. We demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties. Our results raise several very interesting open questions. Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed. It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game. Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market. Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest. The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area. A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.

Los mercados de introducciÃ³n se han utilizado durante mucho tiempo como medio para el comercio. Como efecto secundario del comercio, los participantes en un mercado revelan algo sobre sus preferencias y creencias. Por ejemplo, en un mercado financiero, los agentes comprarÃ­an acciones que creen que estÃ¡n infravaloradas y venderÃ­an acciones que creen que estÃ¡n sobrevaloradas. Durante mucho tiempo se ha observado que, debido a que el precio del mercado estÃ¡ influenciado por todas las operaciones que tienen lugar, agrega la informaciÃ³n privada de todos los comerciantes. Por lo tanto, en una situaciÃ³n en la que los eventos futuros son inciertos, y cada comerciante puede tener un poco de informaciÃ³n, la informaciÃ³n agregada contenida en los precios del mercado puede usarse para predecir eventos futuros. Esto ha motivado la creaciÃ³n de mercados de la informaciÃ³n, que son mecanismos para agregar la informaciÃ³n de los comerciantes sobre un evento incierto. Los mercados de la informaciÃ³n pueden modelarse como un juego en el que los participantes apuestan a una serie de resultados posibles, como los resultados de una elecciÃ³n presidencial, comprando acciones de los resultados y recibiendo pagos cuando se realiza el resultado. Como en los mercados financieros, los participantes tienen como objetivo maximizar sus ganancias comprando bajo y vendiendo altos. De esta manera, el comportamiento de los jugadores transmite su informaciÃ³n y creencias personales sobre los posibles resultados, y puede usarse para predecir el evento con mayor precisiÃ³n. El beneficio de los mercados de informaciÃ³n bien diseÃ±ados va mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de la agregaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n;TambiÃ©n se pueden usar como instrumento de cobertura, para permitir que los comerciantes aseguren el riesgo. Recientemente, los investigadores han recurrido al problema de diseÃ±ar estructuras de mercado especÃ­ficamente para lograr mejores propiedades de agregaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n que los mercados tradicionales. Se han propuesto dos diseÃ±os para los mercados de informaciÃ³n: el mercado dinÃ¡mico parimutuel (DPM) por Pennock [10] y las reglas de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado (MSR) por Hanson [6]. Tanto el DPM como el MSR fueron diseÃ±ados con el objetivo de dar a los comerciantes informados un incentivo para el comercio y revelar su informaciÃ³n lo antes posible, al tiempo que controlan el subsidio que el diseÃ±ador del mercado necesita bombear al mercado. El DPM se creÃ³ como una combinaciÃ³n de un mercado de pari-mutuel (que se usa comÃºnmente para apostar en caballos) y una doble subasta continua, para obtener simultÃ¡neamente los primeros primeros liquidez de compra infinita y la capacidad de los Ãºltimos para reaccionar continuamente anueva informaciÃ³n. Se implementÃ³ una versiÃ³n del DPM en el Yahoo! Buzz Market [8] para probar experimentalmente las propiedades de predicciÃ³n de los mercados. Los fundamentos del MSR se encuentran en la idea de una regla de puntuaciÃ³n adecuada, que es una tÃ©cnica para recompensar a los pronosticadores de una manera que los alienta a dar su mejor predicciÃ³n.316 La innovaciÃ³n en el MSR es utilizar estas reglas de puntuaciÃ³n como instrumentos que se pueden negociar, lo que brinda a los comerciantes que tienen una nueva informaciÃ³n un incentivo para el comercio. El MSR debÃ­a usarse en un mercado de anÃ¡lisis de polÃ­ticas en el Medio Oriente [15], que posteriormente se retirÃ³. Los mercados de la informaciÃ³n dependen de los comerciantes informados que cotizan por sus propias ganancias, por lo que es fundamental comprender las propiedades estratÃ©gicas de estos mercados. Esta no es una tarea fÃ¡cil, porque los mercados son complejos, y los comerciantes pueden influir en las creencias de los demÃ¡s a travÃ©s de sus oficios y, por lo tanto, pueden lograr ganancias a largo plazo manipulando el mercado. Para el MSR, se ha demostrado que, si excluyimos la posibilidad de lograr ganancias a travÃ©s de otros comerciantes engaÃ±osos, es Ã³ptimo que cada comerciante refleje honestamente su creencia privada en sus oficios. Para el DPM, no conocemos ningÃºn anÃ¡lisis estratÃ©gico previo de esta naturaleza;De hecho, se descubriÃ³ un agujero estratÃ©gico mientras probaba el DPM en el Yahoo! Buzz Market [8].1.1 Nuestros resultados en este documento, buscamos desarrollar un mÃ©todo analÃ­tico para guiar el diseÃ±o y el anÃ¡lisis estratÃ©gico de los mercados de la informaciÃ³n. Nuestra contribuciÃ³n central es un nuevo juego de apuestas abstractas, el juego de proyecciÃ³n 1, que sirve como un modelo Ãºtil para los mercados de informaciÃ³n. El juego de proyecciÃ³n es conceptualmente mÃ¡s simple que el MSR y el DPM, y por lo tanto es mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil de analizar. AdemÃ¡s, tiene una visualizaciÃ³n geomÃ©trica atractiva, lo que hace que los movimientos estratÃ©gicos e interacciones sean mÃ¡s transparentes. Presentamos un anÃ¡lisis de las estrategias y ganancias Ã³ptimas en este juego. Luego realizamos un anÃ¡lisis de los costos y ganancias de los comerciantes en el mercado dinÃ¡mico de parimutuel. Sorprendentemente, encontramos que el costo de una secuencia de operaciones en el DPM es idÃ©ntico al costo de los movimientos correspondientes en el juego de proyecciÃ³n. AdemÃ¡s, si suponemos que las creencias de los comerciantes al final de la negociaciÃ³n coinciden con la verdadera probabilidad de que se predice el evento, los pagos y ganancias de los comerciantes en el DPM son idÃ©nticos a sus pagos y ganancias en un juego de proyecciÃ³n correspondiente. Utilizamos la equivalencia entre el DPM y el juego de proyecciÃ³n para demostrar que el DPM no contiene arbitraje, deduce estrategias rentables en el DPM y demostramos que las restricciones en los oficios de los agentes son necesarias para evitar un desglose estratÃ©gico. TambiÃ©n demostramos una equivalencia entre el juego de proyecciÃ³n y el MSR: mostramos que el juego en el MSR es estratÃ©gicamente equivalente a jugar en un juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido, al menos para estrategias miopes y pequeÃ±os oficios. En particular, la rentabilidad de cualquier movimiento bajo la regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica es exactamente proporcional a la rentabilidad del movimiento correspondiente en el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido a un cÃ­rculo, con una ligera distorsiÃ³n de las probabilidades anteriores. Esto nos permite usar el juego de proyecciÃ³n como modelo conceptual para las reglas de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado. Observamos que si bien el MSR con la regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica se asemeja un poco al juego de proyecciÃ³n, debido a la similitud matemÃ¡tica de sus expresiones de ganancias, el modelo DPM es notablemente diferente y, por lo tanto, su equivalencia al juego de proyecciÃ³n es especialmente sorprendente. AdemÃ¡s, debido a que el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido corresponde a un DPM con una restricciÃ³n comercial natural, esto arroja luz sobre una conexiÃ³n intrigante entre el MSR y el DPM.1 En una versiÃ³n anterior de este documento, llamamos a este el juego de segmento. Por Ãºltimo, ilustramos cÃ³mo el modelo de juego de proyecciÃ³n puede usarse para analizar el potencial de manipulaciÃ³n de los mercados de informaciÃ³n para una ganancia a largo plazo.2 Presentamos un escenario de ejemplo en el que puede ocurrir dicha manipulaciÃ³n y sugerir reglas adicionales que podrÃ­an mitigar la posibilidad de la posibilidad de quemanipulaciÃ³n. TambiÃ©n ilustramos otra aplicaciÃ³n para analizar cÃ³mo un fabricante de mercado puede mejorar la precisiÃ³n de la predicciÃ³n de un mercado en el que los comerciantes no comerciarÃ¡n a menos que su ganancia esperada estÃ© por encima de un umbral.1.2 Trabajo relacionado numerosos estudios han demostrado empÃ­ricamente que los precios del mercado son buenos predictores de eventos futuros, y parecen agregar la sabidurÃ­a recolectada de todos los comerciantes [2, 3, 12, 1, 5, 16]. Este efecto tambiÃ©n se ha demostrado en estudios de laboratorio [13, 14], y tiene apoyo teÃ³rico en la literatura de expectativas racionales [9]. Varios estudios recientes han abordado el diseÃ±o de la estructura del mercado y las reglas comerciales para los mercados de la informaciÃ³n, asÃ­ como el incentivo para participar y otros problemas estratÃ©gicos. Los dos documentos mÃ¡s estrechamente relacionados con nuestro trabajo son los documentos de Hanson [6] y Pennock [10]. Sin embargo, los problemas estratÃ©gicos en los mercados de la informaciÃ³n tambiÃ©n han sido estudiados por Mangold et al.[8] y por Hanson, Oprea y Porter [7]. Un prÃ³ximo documento de encuesta [11] analiza las formulaciones de funciones de costo de los fabricantes de mercado automatizados. OrganizaciÃ³n del documento El resto de este documento se organiza de la siguiente manera: en la SecciÃ³n 2, describimos el juego de proyecciÃ³n y analizamos los costos de los jugadores, las ganancias y las estrategias Ã³ptimas en este juego. En la SecciÃ³n 3, estudiamos el mercado dinÃ¡mico de parimutuel y mostramos que el comercio en un DPM es equivalente a un juego de proyecciÃ³n. Establecemos una conexiÃ³n entre el juego de proyecciÃ³n y el MSR en la SecciÃ³n 4. En la SecciÃ³n 5, ilustramos cÃ³mo el juego de proyecciÃ³n puede usarse para analizar acciones no miopic y potencialmente manipulativas. Presentamos nuestras conclusiones y sugerencias para el trabajo futuro, en la SecciÃ³n 6. 2. El juego de proyecciÃ³n En esta secciÃ³n, describimos un juego de apuestas abstractas, el juego de proyecciÃ³n;En las siguientes secciones, argumentaremos que tanto el MSR como el DPM son estratÃ©gicamente similares al juego de proyecciÃ³n. El juego de proyecciÃ³n es conceptualmente mÃ¡s simple que MSR y DPM, y por lo tanto deberÃ­a ser mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil de analizar. Para mayor claridad de exposiciÃ³n, aquÃ­ y en el resto del artÃ­culo suponemos que el espacio es bidimensional, es decir, solo hay dos eventos posibles. Nuestros resultados se generalizan fÃ¡cilmente a mÃ¡s de dos dimensiones. TambiÃ©n asumimos que los jugadores son neutrales en el riesgo. Supongamos que hay dos eventos mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, A y B. (en otras palabras, B es lo mismo que no A) Hay N agentes que pueden tener informaciÃ³n sobre la probabilidad de A y B, y nosotros (los diseÃ±adores) nos gustarÃ­a agregar su informaciÃ³n. Los invitamos a jugar el juego descrito a continuaciÃ³n: en cualquier momento del juego, hay un estado actual descrito por un par de parÃ¡metros, (x, y), que a veces escribimos en forma vectorial como x. Intuitivamente, X corresponde a los 2 aquÃ­, nos referimos solo a la manipulaciÃ³n del mercado de la informaciÃ³n para obtener ganancias posteriores del mercado en sÃ­;No consideramos la posibilidad de que los comerciantes tengan intereses adquiridos en los eventos subyacentes.317 participaciÃ³n total de acciones en A, e Y corresponde a la tenencia de acciones en B. En cada movimiento del juego, un jugador (digamos I) juega una flecha (o segmento) de (x, y) a (x, y). Usamos la notaciÃ³n [(x, y) â†’ (x, y)] o [x, x] para denotar este movimiento. El juego comienza en (0, 0), pero el fabricante de mercado hace el primer movimiento;Sin pÃ©rdida de generalidad, podemos suponer que el movimiento es (1, 1). Todos los movimientos posteriores son realizados por jugadores, en una secuencia arbitraria (y potencialmente repetida). Cada movimiento tiene un costo asociado con Ã©l, dado por C [x, x] = | x |- | x |, donde |Â· |denota la norma euclidiana, | x |= P x2 + y2. Tenga en cuenta que ninguna de las variables estÃ¡ limitada a no ser negativa y, por lo tanto, el costo de un movimiento puede ser negativo. El costo se puede expresar en una forma alternativa, que tambiÃ©n es Ãºtil. Supongamos que el jugador I se mueve de (x, y) a (x, y). Podemos escribir (x, y) como (x + lex, y + ley), de modo que l â‰¥ 0 y | ex | 2 + | ey | 2 = 1. Llamamos a L el volumen del movimiento y (ex, ey) la direcciÃ³n del movimiento. En cualquier punto (Ë†x, Ë†y), hay un precio instantÃ¡neo cargado, definido de la siguiente manera: c ((Ë†x, Ë†y), (ex, ey)) = Ë†xex + Ë†yey | (Ë†x, Ë†y) |= Ë†X Â· e | Ë†x |. Tenga en cuenta que el precio depende solo del Ã¡ngulo entre la lÃ­nea que une el vector (Ë†x, Ë†y) y el segmento [(x, y), (x, y)], y no las longitudes. El costo total del movimiento es el precio integrado en el segmento [(x, y) â†’ (x, y)], es decir, c [(x, y) â†’ (x, y)] = z l w = 0 c ((x +wex, y +wey), (ex, ey)) dw asumimos que el juego termina despuÃ©s de un nÃºmero finito de movimientos. Al final del juego, se determina la verdadera probabilidad P del evento A, y los agentes reciben pagos por los movimientos que hicieron. Sea Q = (Qx, Qy) = (P, 1 - P) | (P, 1 - P) |. La recompensa al agente I para un segmento [(x, y) â†’ (x, y)] viene dada por: P ([(x, y) â†’ (x, y)]) = qx (x - x) + qy(y - y) = q.(x-x) Llamamos a la lÃ­nea a travÃ©s del origen con la pendiente (1-p)/p = qy/qx la lÃ­nea p. Tenga en cuenta que la recompensa tambiÃ©n puede ser negativa. Un inconveniente de la definiciÃ³n de un juego de proyecciÃ³n es que la implementaciÃ³n de los pagos requiere que sepamos la probabilidad real p.Esto es factible si la probabilidad se puede determinar estadÃ­sticamente, como al predecir la frecuencia relativa de diferentes eventos recurrentes o acciones de votaciÃ³n. TambiÃ©n es factible para eventos Ãºnicos en los que hay razones para creer que la verdadera probabilidad es 0 o 1. Para otros eventos Ãºnicos, no se puede implementar directamente (a diferencia de las reglas de puntuaciÃ³n, que se pueden implementar con expectativa). Sin embargo, creemos que incluso en estos casos, el juego de proyecciÃ³n puede ser Ãºtil como una herramienta conceptual y analÃ­tica. Los movimientos, costos y pagos tienen una representaciÃ³n geomÃ©trica natural, que se muestra en la Figura 1 para tres jugadores con un movimiento cada uno. Los jugadores agregan segmentos de lÃ­nea dirigidos a su vez, y el jugador de pago que finalmente recibe para un movimiento es la proyecciÃ³n de su segmento en la lÃ­nea con pendiente (1 - p)/p. Su costo es la diferencia de distancias de los puntos finales de su movimiento al origen.2.1 StrategicProperties of theproycryegygame Comenzamos nuestro anÃ¡lisis estratÃ©gico del juego de proyecciÃ³n observando la siguiente propiedad simple de independencia de ruta.1-P P 3S M ove 1S PAGO M M M OVE 1S Move 2SMOve 3S PAGO DE PAGO 2S PAGO X Y Figura 1: Un juego de proyecciÃ³n con tres jugadores Lema 1. [Independencia de la ruta] Suponga que hay una secuencia de movimientos que conducen desde (x, y)a (x, y). Entonces, el costo total de todos los movimientos es igual al costo del movimiento Ãºnico [(x, y) â†’ (x, y)], y el pago total de todos los movimientos es igual a la recompensa del movimiento Ãºnico [(x, y) â†’ (x, y)]. Prueba. La prueba sigue de manera trivial desde la definiciÃ³n de los costos y los pagos: si consideramos una ruta del punto X al punto X, tanto el cambio neto en las longitudes del vector como la proyecciÃ³n neta en la lÃ­nea P estÃ¡n completamente determinadas por X y X. Aunque simple, la independencia de la ruta de las ganancias es de vital importancia, ya que implica (y estÃ¡ implÃ­cita en) la ausencia de arbitraje en el mercado. En otras palabras, no hay una secuencia de movimientos que comienzan y terminan en el mismo punto, pero resultan en una ganancia positiva. Por otro lado, si hubiera dos caminos de (x, y) a (x, y) con diferentes ganancias, habrÃ­a un camino cÃ­clico con ganancias positivas. Para facilitar la referencia, resumimos algunas propiedades mÃ¡s Ãºtiles de las funciones de costo y pago en el juego de proyecciÃ³n. Lema 2. 1. El precio instantÃ¡neo para moverse a lo largo de una lÃ­nea a travÃ©s del origen es 1 o -1, cuando el movimiento estÃ¡ fuera o hacia el origen respectivamente. El precio instantÃ¡neo a lo largo de un cÃ­rculo centrado en el origen es 0. 2. Cuando X se mueve a lo largo de un cÃ­rculo centrado en el origen para el punto Â¯x en la lÃ­nea P positiva, el pago correspondiente es p (x, Â¯x) = | x |- x Â· q, y el costo es c [x, Â¯x] = 0. 3. Las dos formulaciones de funciÃ³n de costo son equivalentes: c [x, x] = z l w = 0 cos (x + we, e) dw = | x | - | x |âˆ€x, x, donde E es el vector unitario que da la direcciÃ³n de movimiento. AdemÃ¡s, cuando X se mueve a lo largo de la lÃ­nea P positiva, el pago es igual al costo, p (x, x) = | x |- | x |. Prueba.1. El precio instantÃ¡neo es c (x, e) = x Â· e/| x |= cos (x, e), donde e es la direcciÃ³n del movimiento, y el resultado sigue.2. Dado que Â¯x estÃ¡ en la lÃ­nea P positiva, q Â· Â¯x = | Â¯x |= | x |, de ahÃ­ p (x, Â¯x) = q Â· (Â¯x - x) = | x |- x Â· q;El costo es 0 de la definiciÃ³n.318 3. De la Parte 1, el costo de moverse de x al origen es c [x, 0] = z l w = 0 cos (x + we, e) dw = z l w = 0 (âˆ’1) dw = - | x |,donde l = | x |, e = x/| x |. Por la propiedad de independencia de ruta, c [x, x] = c [x, 0] + c [0, x] = | x |- | x |. Finalmente, se proyecta un punto en la lÃ­nea P positiva, a saber, q Â· x = | x |Entonces, cuando el movimiento estÃ¡ a lo largo de la lÃ­nea P positiva, p (x, x) = q Â· (x-x) = | x |- | x |= C [x, x]. Ahora consideramos la pregunta de quÃ© movimientos son rentables en este juego. El beneficio eventual de un movimiento [x, x], donde x = x + l. (Ex, ey), es ganancias [x, x] = p [x, x] - c [x, x] = lq.eâˆ’ C [x, x] diferenciando con respecto a L, obtenemos d (ganancias) dl = q.e - c (x + le, e) = q.e - x + le | x + le |.e observamos que esto es 0 si p (y + ley) = (1 - p) (x + lex), en otras palabras, cuando los vectores q y (x + le) estÃ¡n exactamente alineados. AdemÃ¡s, observamos que el precio no se puede reducir al aumentar la L.Por lo tanto, a lo largo de la direcciÃ³n E, el beneficio se maximiza en el punto de intersecciÃ³n con la lÃ­nea P. Por Lemma 2, siempre hay una ruta de x a la lÃ­nea P positiva con 0 costo, que estÃ¡ dado por un arco del cÃ­rculo con centro en el origen y el radio | x |. AdemÃ¡s, cualquier movimiento a lo largo de la lÃ­nea P tiene 0 ganancias adicionales. Por lo tanto, para cualquier punto x, podemos definir el potencial de ganancias Ï† (x, p) por Ï† (x, p) = | x |- x Â· q. Tenga en cuenta que el potencial es positivo para X OFF la lÃ­nea P positiva y cero para X en la lÃ­nea. A continuaciÃ³n, mostramos que un movimiento a un potencial mÃ¡s bajo siempre es rentable. Lema 3. El beneficio de un movimiento [x, x] es igual a la diferencia en el potencial Ï† (x, p) - Ï† (x, p). Prueba. Denota z = | x | q y z = | x | q, es decir, estos son los puntos de intersecciÃ³n de la lÃ­nea p positiva con los cÃ­rculos centrados en el origen con radios | x |y | x |respectivamente. Por la propiedad de la independencia de la ruta y el Lemma 2, el beneficio del movimiento [x, x] es ganancias (x, x) = beneficio (x, z) + beneficio (z, z) + beneficio (z, x) = (|x | - x Â· q) + 0 + (x Â· q - | x |) = Ï† (x, p) - Ï† (x, p). Por lo tanto, el beneficio de la medida es igual al cambio en el potencial de ganancias entre los puntos finales. Este lema ofrece otra forma de ver que es Ã³ptimo moverse al punto de menor potencial, a saber, a la lÃ­nea P.p y 1 - p x x x z z beneficio = | x | âˆ’x.q beneficio = x.qâˆ’ | x |Beneficio = 0 Figura 2: La ganancia del movimiento [x, x] es igual al cambio de potencial de ganancias de x a x.3. Pennock [10] introdujo el mercado de parimutuel dinÃ¡mico El mercado dinÃ¡mico parimutuel (DPM) como una estructura del mercado de la informaciÃ³n que alienta a los comerciantes informados a comerciar temprano, tiene liquidez garantizada y requiere un subsidio limitado. Esta estructura de mercado se utilizÃ³ en Yahoo! Buzz Market [8]. En esta secciÃ³n, mostramos que el mercado dinÃ¡mico Parimutuel tambiÃ©n es notablemente similar al juego de proyecciÃ³n. Junto con la SecciÃ³n 4, esto tambiÃ©n demuestra una fuerte conexiÃ³n entre el DPM y el MSR. En un DPM de dos eventos, los usuarios pueden hacer apuestas en cualquier evento A o B en cualquier momento, comprando una acciÃ³n en el evento apropiado. El precio de una acciÃ³n es variable, determinado por la cantidad total de dinero en el mercado y el nÃºmero de acciones actualmente en circulaciÃ³n. AdemÃ¡s, las acciones existentes se pueden vender al precio actual. DespuÃ©s de determinar quÃ© evento realmente sucede, las acciones se liquidan por efectivo. En la variante redistribuida de dinero total de DPM, que es la variante utilizada en el Yahoo!Mercado, el dinero total se divide por igual entre las acciones del evento ganador;Las acciones del evento perdedor no tienen valor. Tenga en cuenta que los pagos estÃ¡n indefinidos si el evento tiene cero acciones en circulaciÃ³n;Las reglas de DPM deberÃ­an impedir esta posibilidad. Utilizamos la siguiente notaciÃ³n: Sea X el nÃºmero de acciones en circulaciÃ³n de A (totalizadas sobre todos los comerciantes), y y serÃ¡n el nÃºmero de acciones en circulaciÃ³n en B. Deje que M denote el dinero total actualmente en el mercado. Deje que CA y CB denoten los precios de las acciones en A y B respectivamente. El precio de una acciÃ³n en el Yahoo! DPM estÃ¡ determinado por el principio de relaciÃ³n de acciones: Ca Cb = x y (1) La forma de los precios puede determinarse completamente estipulando que, para cualquier valor dado de M, X e Y, debe haber alguna probabilidad PA de tal manera que, si un comerciante cree que la AP es la probabilidad de que A ocurra A y que el mercado liquidarÃ¡ en el estado actual, no puede esperar beneficiar a la compra o la venta de cualquiera de las acciones. Esto nos da ca = pa hm x i cb = pb hm y i 319 Desde pa + pb = 1, tenemos: xca + ycb = m (2) Finalmente, combinando las ecuaciones 1 y 2, obtenemos ca = x m x2 + y2 cb= Y M X2 + Y2 Costo de un comercio en el DPM Considere un comerciante que llega a un DPM en el estado (M, X, Y), y compra o vende acciones de tal manera que el estado eventual sea (M, X, Y). Â¿CuÃ¡l es el costo neto, m - m, de su movimiento? Teorema 4. El costo del movimiento de (x, y) a (x, y) es m - m = m0 [p x 2 + y 2 - p x2 + y2] para alguna constante m0. En otras palabras, es un mÃºltiplo constante del costo correspondiente en el juego de proyecciÃ³n. Prueba. Considere la funciÃ³n g (x, y) = m0 [p x2 + y2]. La funciÃ³n g es diferenciable para todos x, y = 0, y sus derivados parciales son: âˆ‚g âˆ‚x = m0 [x p x2 + y2] = x g (x, y) x2 + y2 âˆ‚g âˆ‚y = m0 [y px2 + y2] = y g (x, y) x2 + y2 Ahora, compare estas ecuaciones con los precios en el DPM y observe que, como un comerciante compra o vende en el DPM, el precio instantÃ¡neo es el derivado del dinero. Se deduce que, si en algÃºn momento el DPM estÃ¡ en un estado (m, x, y) de modo que m = g (x, y), entonces, en todos los puntos de tiempo posteriores, el estado (m, x,y) del DPM satisfarÃ¡ m = g (x, y). Finalmente, tenga en cuenta que podemos elegir el M0 constante de tal manera que la ecuaciÃ³n estÃ© satisfecha para el estado inicial del DPM y, por lo tanto, siempre se satisfarÃ¡. Una consecuencia importante del Teorema 4 es que el mercado dinÃ¡mico de parimutuel sin arbitraje (usando el Lema 1). Es interesante notar que el yahoo! original Buzz Market utilizÃ³ una regla de precios diferente, que permitiÃ³ el arbitraje;La regla de precios se cambiÃ³ a la regla de la relaciÃ³n de acciones despuÃ©s de que los comerciantes comenzaron a explotar las oportunidades de arbitraje [8]. Otra consecuencia algo sorprendente es que el nÃºmero de acciones en circulaciÃ³n X, y determina completamente la capitalizaciÃ³n total M del DPM. Las restricciones en el DPM, aunque puede parecer, segÃºn los costos, que cualquier movimiento en el juego de proyecciÃ³n tiene un movimiento equivalente en el DPM, el DPM impone algunas limitaciones a los intercambios. En primer lugar, ningÃºn comerciante puede tener una tenencia negativa neta en ninguna de las acciones. Esto es importante, porque asegura que las tenencias totales en cada acciÃ³n siempre sean positivas. Sin embargo, esta es una restricciÃ³n lÃ­mite, y no afecta las elecciones estratÃ©gicas para un jugador con una tenencia positiva suficientemente grande en cada acciÃ³n. Por lo tanto, podemos ignorar esta restricciÃ³n de un anÃ¡lisis estratÃ©gico de primer orden del DPM. En segundo lugar, por razones prÃ¡cticas, un DPM probablemente tendrÃ¡ una unidad mÃ­nima de comercio, pero suponemos aquÃ­ que se pueden comercializar cantidades arbitrariamente pequeÃ±as. Los pagos en el DPM en algÃºn momento, cesan el DPM y se liquidan las acciones. Suponemos aquÃ­ que la verdadera probabilidad se conoce en el momento de la liquidaciÃ³n y describimos los pagos en tÃ©rminos de la probabilidad;Sin embargo, si no se revela la probabilidad, solo el evento que realmente ocurre, estos pagos se pueden implementar con expectativa. Supongamos que los DPM terminan en un estado (M, X, Y), y la verdadera probabilidad de Evento A es p.Cuando se liquide el mercado dinÃ¡mico parimutuel, las acciones se pagan de la siguiente manera: cada propietario de una parte de A recibe PM X, y cada propietario de una parte de B recibe (1 - p) M y, por cada acciÃ³n de propiedad. Los pagos en el DPM, aunque dados por una forma bastante simple, son conceptualmente complejos, porque el pago de un movimiento depende de los movimientos posteriores antes de que el mercado se liquide. Por lo tanto, una elecciÃ³n totalmente racional de movimiento en el DPM para el jugador deberÃ­a tener en cuenta las acciones de los jugadores posteriores, incluido el jugador I mismo. AquÃ­, restringimos el anÃ¡lisis a las estrategias miope e infinitesimales: dada la posiciÃ³n del mercado (M, x, y), Â¿en quÃ© direcciÃ³n debe un jugador hacer un movimiento infinitesimal para maximizar sus ganancias? Mostramos que los pagos infinitesimales y las ganancias de un DPM con verdadera probabilidad P corresponden estratÃ©gicamente a los pagos infinitesimales y las ganancias de un juego de proyecciÃ³n con probabilidades P P/(1 - P), en el siguiente sentido: Lema 5. Supongamos que el jugador I estÃ¡ a punto de hacer un movimiento en un mercado dinÃ¡mico parimutuel en un estado (M, x, y), y la verdadera probabilidad de evento A es p.Luego, suponiendo que el mercado se liquide despuÃ©s de que se mude, â€¢ Si x y <q p 1 - P, el jugador I se beneficia comprando acciones en A o vendiendo acciones en B. â€¢ Si x y> q p 1 - P, el jugador I se beneficia vendiendo accionesen a, o comprar acciones en B. Prueba. Considere el costo y la recompensa de comprar una pequeÃ±a cantidad Î”x de acciones en A. El costo es c [(x, y) â†’ (x + Î”x, y)] = Î”x Â· x m x2 + y2, y el pago es Î”x Â· pm x. Por lo tanto, comprar las acciones es rentable IFF Î”X Â· X M X2 + Y2 <Î”X Â· P M X â‡” X2 X2 + Y2 <P â‡” X2 + Y2 X2> 1 P â‡” 1 + (Y X) 2> 1 P â‡” Y X> R1 - p p â‡” x y <r p 1 - p Por lo tanto, comprar A es rentable si x y <q p 1 - p, y vender A es rentable si x y> q p 1 - p. El anÃ¡lisis para comprar o vender B es similar, con P y (1 - P) intercambiado. De Lemma 5 se deduce que es miopicalmente rentable para los jugadores avanzar hacia la lÃ­nea con la pendiente Q 1 - P p. Tenga en cuenta que hay un mapeo uno a uno entre 1-P P y Q 1-P P 320 en sus rangos respectivos, por lo que esta lÃ­nea se define de manera Ãºnica, y cada una de estas lÃ­neas tambiÃ©n corresponde a una P Ãºnica.Sin embargo, debido a que la recompensa real de un movimiento depende de los movimientos futuros, los jugadores deben basar sus decisiones en alguna creencia sobre el estado final del mercado. A la luz del Lema 5, una suposiciÃ³n de estilo de expectaciÃ³n natural y racional es que el estado final (m, x âˆ—, y âˆ—) satisfarÃ¡ x âˆ— y âˆ— = q p 1-p.(En otras palabras, se podrÃ­a suponer que las creencias de los comerciantes en Ãºltima instancia convergerÃ¡n a la verdadera probabilidad P; sabiendo P, los comerciantes impulsarÃ¡n al estado del mercado a satisfacer x y = q p 1 - p.) Esto es muy plausible en los mercados (como el Yahoo! Mercado de rumores) en el que se permite el comercio correctamente hasta que se liquide el mercado, momento en el cual no hay incertidumbre restante sobre las frecuencias relevantes. Bajo esta suposiciÃ³n, podemos probar una conexiÃ³n aÃºn mÃ¡s estrecha entre los pagos en el DPM (donde la verdadera probabilidad es P) y los pagos en el juego de proyecciÃ³n, con las probabilidades Q P 1 - P: Teorema 6. Suponga que el DPM finalmente termina en un estado (m, x, y) que satisface x y = q p 1 - p. Suponga sin pÃ©rdida de generalidad que la constante M0 = 1, entonces M = âˆš x2 + y 2. Luego, la recompensa final para cualquier movimiento [x â†’ x] realizado en el curso del comercio es (x - x) Â· (âˆš p, âˆš 1 - p), es decir, es lo mismo que el recompensa en el juego de proyecciÃ³n conODDSQ P 1 - P. Prueba. Primero, observe que x m = âˆš p e y m = âˆš 1 - p.El pago final es el valor de liquidaciÃ³n de (x - x) acciones de A e (y - y) acciones de B, que es PayOffDP m [x - x] = P m x (x - x) + (1 - p) m y(y - y) = p 1 âˆš p (x - x) + (1 - p) 1 âˆš 1 - p (y - y) = âˆš p (x - x) + p 1 - p (y - y). El anÃ¡lisis estratÃ©gico para los teoremas de DPM 4 y 6 nos dan una equivalencia muy fuerte entre el juego de proyecciÃ³n y el mercado dinÃ¡mico parimutuel, bajo el supuesto de que el DPM converge al valor Ã³ptimo para la verdadera probabilidad. Un jugador que juega en un DPM con verdaderas probabilidades P/(1 - P), puede imaginarse a sÃ­ mismo jugando en el juego de proyecciÃ³n con Odds Q P 1 - P, porque tanto los costos como los pagos de cualquier movimiento son idÃ©nticos. Usando esta equivalencia, podemos transferir todas las propiedades estratÃ©gicas probadas para el juego de proyecciÃ³n directamente al anÃ¡lisis del mercado dinÃ¡mico parimutuel. Una conclusiÃ³n particularmente interesante que podemos sacar es la siguiente: en ausencia de cualquier restricciÃ³n que lo elimine, siempre es rentable que un agente avance hacia el origen, vendiendo acciones tanto en A como en B mientras mantiene la relaciÃ³n x/y. En el DPM, esto estÃ¡ limitado al prohibir las ventas cortas, por lo que los jugadores nunca pueden tener tenencias negativas en ninguna de las acciones. Como resultado, cuando su tenencia en una acciÃ³n (digamos a) es 0, no pueden usar la estrategia de avanzar hacia el origen. Podemos concluir que un jugador racional nunca debe tener acciones de A y B simultÃ¡neamente, independientemente de sus creencias y la posiciÃ³n del mercado. Esta discusiÃ³n nos lleva a considerar un DPM modificado, en el que este laguna estratÃ©gica se aborda directamente: en lugar de rechazar todas las ventas cortas, colocamos una restricciÃ³n de que ningÃºn agente reduzca la capitalizaciÃ³n de mercado total (o, alternativamente, que cualquier agente total de inversiÃ³nen el mercado siempre no es negativo). Llamamos a esto la restricciÃ³n de capitalizaciÃ³n de mercado que no se puede crear para el DPM. Esto corresponde a una restricciÃ³n de que ningÃºn movimiento en el juego de proyecciÃ³n reduce el radio. Sin embargo, podemos concluir de la discusiÃ³n anterior que los jugadores no tienen incentivos para aumentar el radio. Por lo tanto, los movimientos del juego de proyecciÃ³n se encuentran en el cÃ­rculo de cuarto en el cuadrante positivo, con el radio determinado por el movimiento de los fabricantes del mercado. En la SecciÃ³n 4, mostramos que el juego de proyecciÃ³n en este cÃ­rculo de trimestre es estratÃ©gicamente equivalente (al menos miopicalmente) para comerciar en una regla de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado. Por lo tanto, el DPM y el MSR parecen estar profundamente conectados entre sÃ­, como diferentes interfaces para el mismo juego subyacente.4. Reglas de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado La regla de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado (MSR) fue introducida por Hanson [6]. Se basa en el concepto de una regla de puntuaciÃ³n adecuada, una tÃ©cnica que recompensa a los pronosticadores para dar su mejor predicciÃ³n. Hansons Innovation debÃ­a convertir las reglas de puntuaciÃ³n en instrumentos que se pueden negociar, lo que proporciona a los comerciantes que tienen a los comerciantes que tienen una nueva informaciÃ³n un incentivo para el comercio. Un efecto positivo de este diseÃ±o es que un solo comerciante aÃºn tendrÃ­a un incentivo para el comercio, lo cual es equivalente a actualizar el informe de la regla de puntuaciÃ³n para reflejar su informaciÃ³n, eliminando asÃ­ el problema de los mercados delgados y la iliquidez. En esta secciÃ³n, mostramos que, cuando la regla de puntuaciÃ³n utilizada es la regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica [4], existe una fuerte equivalencia estratÃ©gica entre el juego de proyecciÃ³n y la regla de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado. Las reglas de puntuaciÃ³n adecuadas son herramientas utilizadas para recompensar los pronosticadores que predicen la distribuciÃ³n de probabilidad de un evento. Describimos esto en la configuraciÃ³n simple de dos eventos exhaustivos y mutuamente excluyentes A y B. En la configuraciÃ³n simple de dos eventos exhaustivos y mutuamente excluyentes A y B, las reglas de puntuaciÃ³n adecuadas se definen de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el pronosticador predice que las probabilidades de los eventos son r = (ra, rb), con ra + rb = 1. La regla de puntuaciÃ³n se especifica mediante las funciones SA (RA, RB) y SB (RA, RB), que se aplican de la siguiente manera: si se produce el evento A, el pronosticador se paga SA (RA, RB), y si el evento B ocurre, el pronosticador se le paga SB (RA, RB). La propiedad clave que satisface una regla de puntuaciÃ³n adecuada es que el pago esperado se maximiza cuando el informe es idÃ©ntico a la distribuciÃ³n de probabilidad verdadera.4.1 Equivalencia con la regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica En esta secciÃ³n, nos centramos en una regla de puntuaciÃ³n especÃ­fica: la regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica [4]. DefiniciÃ³n 1. La regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica [4] se define por si (r) def = ri/|| r ||. Para dos eventos, esto se puede escribir como: sa (ra, rb) = ra p r2 a + r2 b;SB (RA, RB) = RB P R2 A + R2 B Se sabe que la regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica es una regla de puntuaciÃ³n adecuada. La definiciÃ³n se generaliza naturalmente a las dimensiones superiores. Ahora demostramos una estrecha conexiÃ³n entre el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido a un arco circular y una regla de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado que utiliza la regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica. En este punto, es 321 conveniente usar notaciÃ³n vectorial. Sea x = (x, y) denota una posiciÃ³n en el juego de proyecciÃ³n. Consideramos el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido al cÃ­rculo | x |= 1. Juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido Considere un movimiento en este juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido de X a X. Recuerde que Q = (P âˆš P2+(1 - P) 2, 1 - P âˆš P2+(1 - P) 2), donde P es la verdadera probabilidad del evento. Luego, la ganancia del juego de proyecciÃ³n de un movimiento [x, x] es q Â· [x - x] (seÃ±alando que | x | = | x |). Podemos extender esto a una colecciÃ³n arbitraria3 de (no necesariamente contiguo) se mueve x = {[x1, x1], [x2, x2], Â· Â· Â·, [xl, xl]}. Seg-profitp (x) = x [x, x] âˆˆX q Â· [x-x] = q Â· 2 4 x [x, x] âˆˆX [x-x] 3 5 ganancia de regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica ahora giramos nuestroAtenciÃ³n al MSR con la regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica (SSR). Considere a un jugador que cambia el informe de R a R. Entonces, si la verdadera probabilidad de A es P, su beneficio esperado es SSR-Profit ([R, R]) = P (SA (R) âˆ’SA (R))+(1-P) (SB (R)-âˆ’SB (R)) Ahora, representamos la posiciÃ³n inicial y final en tÃ©rminos de coordenadas circulares. Para R = (RA, Rb), defina las coordenadas correspondientes x = (Raâˆš R2 A+R2 B, RBâˆš R2 A+R2 B). Tenga en cuenta que las coordenadas satisfacen | x |= 1, y por lo tanto corresponde a coordenadas vÃ¡lidas para el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido. Ahora, deje que P denote el vector [P, 1 - P]. Luego, expandiendo las funciones de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica SA, SB, los jugadores se benefician para un movimiento de R a R se pueden reescribir en tÃ©rminos de las coordenadas correspondientes x, x como: SSR-Profit ([x, x]) = P Â· (x-x) Para cualquier colecciÃ³n X de movimientos, el pago total en el mercado de SSR viene dado por: SSR-Profitp (x) = x [x, x] âˆˆX P Â· [x-x] = p Â· 2 4 x [x, x] âˆˆX [x - x] 3 5 Finalmente, observamos que P y Q estÃ¡n relacionados con Q = Î¼PP, donde Î¼P = 1/ p p2 + (1 - p) 2 es un escalar que depende solo de P.Esto inmediatamente nos da la siguiente equivalencia estratÃ©gica fuerte para el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido y el mercado de SSR: Teorema 7. Cualquier colecciÃ³n de movimientos x produce una recompensa positiva (negativa) en el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido IFF X produce un pago positivo (negativo) en el mercado de reglas de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica. Prueba. Como se derivÃ³ anteriormente, SEG-ProfitP (x) = Î¼PSSR-ProfitP (x). Para todas las p, 1 â‰¤ Î¼P â‰¤ âˆš 2, (o mÃ¡s generalmente para un vector de probabilidad ndimensional P, 1 â‰¤ Î¼P = 1 | P | â‰¤ âˆš n, por la desigualdad cuadrada media de raÃ­z media aritmÃ©tica), y el resultado sigue inmediatamente.3 Permitimos que la colecciÃ³n contenga movimientos repetidos, es decir, es un Multiset. Aunque el Teorema 7 se establece en tÃ©rminos del signo de la recompensa, se extiende a los pagos relativos de dos colecciones de movimientos: Corolario 8. Considere dos colecciones de movimientos x, x. Luego, X produce una recompensa mayor que X en el juego de proyecciÃ³n IFF X produce un pago mayor que X en el mercado de SSR. Prueba. Cada movimiento [x, x] tiene un movimiento inverso correspondiente [x, x]. Tanto en el juego de proyecciÃ³n como en la SSR, el beneficio de movimiento inverso es simplemente la ganancia negativa del movimiento (los movimientos son reversibles). Podemos definir una colecciÃ³n de movimientos x = x - x agregando el inverso de x a x. Tenga en cuenta que SEG-ProfitP (x) = SEG-ProfitP (x) âˆ’seg-ProfitP (x) y SSR-ProfitP (x) = SSR-ProfitP (x) âˆ’SSR-ProfitP (x);La aplicaciÃ³n del Teorema 7 completa la prueba. Se deduce que la optimizaciÃ³n ex post de un movimiento (o conjunto de movimientos) es la misma tanto en el juego de proyecciÃ³n como en el mercado de SSR. Por sÃ­ solo, esta fuerte equivalencia ex post no es completamente satisfactoria, porque en cualquier juego no trivial existe incertidumbre sobre el valor de P, y las diferentes relaciones de escala para diferentes P podrÃ­an conducir a un comportamiento Ã³ptimo de diferentes ex ante. Podemos extender la correspondencia a la configuraciÃ³n con P incierta, de la siguiente manera: Teorema 9. Considere el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido con alguna distribuciÃ³n de probabilidad previa F sobre posibles valores de p.Luego, hay una distribuciÃ³n de probabilidad G con el mismo soporte que F, y una constante estrictamente positiva C que depende solo de F tal que: â€¢ (i) para cualquier colecciÃ³n X de movimientos, las ganancias esperadas estÃ¡n relacionadas con: EF (SEG-Profit (x)) = ceg (SSR-Profit (x)) â€¢ (ii) Para cualquier colecciÃ³n X, y cualquier conjunto de informaciÃ³n medible I âŠ† [0, 1], las ganancias esperadas condicionadas a saber que p âˆˆ Satisface EF(SEG-Profit (x) | P âˆˆ I) = CEG (SSR-Profit (x) | P âˆˆ I) El Converse tambiÃ©n se mantiene: para cualquier distribuciÃ³n de probabilidad G, hay una distribuciÃ³n F de modo que ambas declaraciones son verdaderas. Prueba. Para simplificar, suponga que F tiene una funciÃ³n de densidad f.(El resultado se mantiene incluso para distribuciones no continuas). Entonces, deje c = R 1 0 Î¼PF (P) DP. Defina la funciÃ³n de densidad G de la distribuciÃ³n G por g (p) = Î¼pf (p) c Now, para una colecciÃ³n de movimientos x, ef (seg-profit (x)) = z SEG-Profitp (x) f (p) DP= Z ssr-profitp (x) Î¼PF (p) dp = z ssr-profitp (x) cg (p) dp = ceg (ssr-profit (x)) 322 âˆ’1 âˆ’0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 âˆ’1 âˆ’0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x Y Regla de puntuaciÃ³n de registro Regla de puntuaciÃ³n cuadrÃ¡tica Figura 3: Curvas de puntuaciÃ³n de muestra para la regla de puntuaciÃ³n de registro Si (R) = AI + B Log RI y la regla de puntuaciÃ³n cuadrÃ¡tica Si (R) = AI + B (2RI (2RI- P K R2 K). Para probar la parte (ii), simplemente restringimos la integral a los valores en I. El Converse sigue de manera similar construyendo F a partir de G. AnÃ¡lisis de las estrategias MSR Teorema 9 proporciona la base para el anÃ¡lisis de estrategias en los mercados de reglas de puntuaciÃ³n. En la medida en que las estrategias en estos mercados son independientes de la regla de puntuaciÃ³n especÃ­fica utilizada, podemos usar la regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica como instrumento de mercado. Luego, el anÃ¡lisis de estrategias en el juego de proyecciÃ³n con una distribuciÃ³n ligeramente distorsionada sobre P se puede utilizar para comprender las propiedades estratÃ©gicas de la situaciÃ³n del mercado original. ImplementaciÃ³n En expectativa, otra consecuencia importante del Teorema 9 es que el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido se puede implementar con una pequeÃ±a distorsiÃ³n en la distribuciÃ³n de probabilidad sobre los valores de P, mediante el uso de una regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica para implementar los pagos. Esto hace que el juego de proyecciÃ³n sea valioso como una herramienta de diseÃ±o;Por ejemplo, podemos analizar nuevas limitaciones y reglas en el juego de proyecciÃ³n, y luego implementarlas a travÃ©s de la SSR. Desafortunadamente, el resultado no se extiende a juegos de proyecciÃ³n sin restricciones, porque la ganancia relativa de moverse a lo largo del cÃ­rculo versus el radio cambiante no se conserva a travÃ©s de esta transformaciÃ³n. Sin embargo, es posible extender la transformaciÃ³n a los juegos de proyecciÃ³n en los que el radio RI despuÃ©s del movimiento Ã©simo es una funciÃ³n fija de I (no necesariamente constante), por lo que no estÃ¡ dentro del control estratÃ©gico del jugador que hace el movimiento;Tales juegos tambiÃ©n se pueden implementar estratÃ©gicamente a travÃ©s de la regla de puntuaciÃ³n esfÃ©rica (con distorsiÃ³n de los antecedentes).4.2 ConexiÃ³n a otras reglas de puntuaciÃ³n en esta secciÃ³n, mostramos una similitud mÃ¡s dÃ©bil entre el juego de proyecciÃ³n y el MSR con otras reglas de puntuaciÃ³n. Probamos una similitud infinitesimal entre el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido y el MSR con la regla de puntuaciÃ³n de log;El resultado se generaliza a todas las reglas de puntuaciÃ³n adecuadas que tienen un mÃ¡ximo local y global Ãºnico. En la Figura 3 se representa una visualizaciÃ³n geomÃ©trica de algunas reglas de puntuaciÃ³n comunes en dos dimensiones. Las curvas de puntaje en la figura se definen por {(S1 (R), S2 (R)) |r = (r, 1 - r), r âˆˆ [0, 1]}. De manera similar al juego de proyecciÃ³n, defina el potencial de ganancias de una probabilidad R en MSR de ser el cambio en las ganancias para pasar de r a la p, Ï†Msr (s (r), p) = ganancias [s (r), s (s (pag)]. Mostraremos que los potenciales de ganancias en los dos juegos tienen roles anÃ¡logos para analizar las estrategias Ã³ptimas, en particular ambas funciones potenciales tienen un mÃ­nimo global 0 en r = p.Teorema 10. Considere el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido al cÃ­rculo unitario no negativo donde las estrategias x tienen la correspondencia natural uno a uno a las distribuciones de probabilidad r = (r, 1-r) dada por x = (r | r |, 1-R |r |). El comercio en una regla de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado de registros es estratÃ©gicamente similar al comercio en el juego de proyecciÃ³n en el cuarto de cÃ­rculo, en ese D dr Ï† (s (r), p) <0 para r <p d dr Ï† (s (r), p)> 0 para r> p, tanto para el juego de proyecciÃ³n como para los potenciales MSR Ï† (.). Prueba.(boceto) El derivado del potencial MSR es D Dr Ï† (S (R), P) = âˆ’p Â· D Dr S (R) = - X I PISI (R). Para la regla de puntuaciÃ³n de registro Si (R) = Ai + B log Ri con B> 0, D DR Ï†MSR (S (R), P) = âˆ’p Â· B R, - B 1 - R = âˆ’B P R - 1 - P 1- r = b r - p r (1 - r). Dado que r = (r, 1 - r) es una distribuciÃ³n de probabilidad, esta expresiÃ³n es positiva para r> p y negativa para r <p como se desea. Ahora, considere el juego de proyecciÃ³n en el cÃ­rculo de la unidad no negativa. El potencial para cualquier x = (r | r |, 1 - r | r |) es dado por Ï† (x (r), p) = | x |- q Â· x (r), es fÃ¡cil demostrar que d dr Ï† (x (r), p) <0 para r <p y la derivada es positiva para r> p, por lo que la funciÃ³n potencial a lo largo del cÃ­rculo estÃ¡ disminuyendoy luego aumentando con R de manera similar a una funciÃ³n de energÃ­a, con un mÃ­nimo global en R = P, como se desea. El Teorema 10 establece que la regla de puntuaciÃ³n del registro del mercado es estratÃ©gicamente similar al juego de proyecciÃ³n jugado en un cÃ­rculo, en el sentido de que la direcciÃ³n Ã³ptima del movimiento en el estado actual es la misma en ambos juegos. Por ejemplo, si el estado actual es R <P, es rentable moverse a R+Dr ya que el beneficio efectivo de ese movimiento es ganancias (r, r) = Ï† (s (r), p) - Ï† (s (s (s (s (r + dr), p)> 0. Aunque se afirma para las reglas de escorsiÃ³n de registro, el teorema es vÃ¡lido para cualquier regla de puntuaciÃ³n que induce un potencial con un mÃ­nimo local y global Ãºnico en P, como la regla de puntuaciÃ³n cuadrÃ¡tica y otras.5. Utilizando el Gamemodel de ProfecciÃ³n, las principales ventajas del juego de proyecciÃ³n son que es analÃ­ticamente manejable y tambiÃ©n es fÃ¡cil de visualizar. En la SecciÃ³n 3, utilizamos el modelo de juego de proyecciÃ³n del DPM para probar la ausencia de arbitraje e inferir propiedades estratÃ©gicas que podrÃ­an haber sido difÃ­ciles de deducir de otra manera. En esta secciÃ³n, proporcionamos dos ejemplos que ilustran el poder del anÃ¡lisis del juego de proyecciÃ³n para obtener informaciÃ³n sobre entornos estratÃ©gicos mÃ¡s complejos.323 5.1 Comerciantes Con inercia El anÃ¡lisis estÃ¡ndar del comportamiento del comerciante en cualquiera de los formularios de mercado hemos estudiado afirma que los comerciantes que no estÃ¡n de acuerdo con las probabilidades de mercado esperarÃ¡n que ganen de cambiar la probabilidad y, por lo tanto, tienen un incentivo estricto para comerciar en el mercado. Sin embargo, la ganancia esperada puede ser muy pequeÃ±a. Un modelo plausible de comportamiento real del comerciante podrÃ­a incluir alguna forma de inercia o Ã³ptima: suponemos que los comerciantes comerciarÃ¡n si su ganancia esperada es mayor que alguna constante. No intentamos justificar este modelo aquÃ­;MÃ¡s bien, ilustramos cÃ³mo se puede usar el juego de proyecciÃ³n para analizar tales situaciones y arrojar algo de luz sobre cÃ³mo modificar las reglas comerciales para aliviar este problema. Considere el juego de proyecciÃ³n simple restringido a un arco circular con radio unitario;Como hemos visto, esto corresponde estrechamente a la regla de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado esfÃ©rico y al mercado dinÃ¡mico parimutuel bajo una restricciÃ³n razonable. Ahora, supongamos que la probabilidad de mercado es P, y un comerciante cree que la verdadera probabilidad es p. Luego, se puede calcular su ganancia esperada, de la siguiente manera: Sea Q y Q los vectores unitarios en las direcciones de P y P respectivamente. La ganancia esperada viene dada por E = Ï† (Q, P) = 1âˆ’ Q Â· Q. Por lo tanto, el comerciante comerciarÃ¡ solo si 1 - Q Â· Q>. Si dejamos que Î¸ y Î¸ sean los Ã¡ngulos de la lÃ­nea p y la lÃ­nea p respectivamente (del eje x), obtenemos E = 1-cos (Î¸-Î¸);Cuando Î¸ estÃ¡ cerca de Î¸, una aproximaciÃ³n de la serie Taylor nos da que E â‰ˆ (Î¸ - Î¸) 2/2. Por lo tanto, podemos derivar un lÃ­mite en el lÃ­mite de la precisiÃ³n del mercado: el precio del mercado no cambiarÃ¡ siempre que (Î¸ - Î¸) 2 â‰¤ 2. Ahora, suponga que un operador de mercado que enfrenta esta situaciÃ³n querÃ­a agudizar la precisiÃ³n del mercado. Un enfoque natural es simplemente multiplicar todos los pagos por una constante. Esto corresponde al uso de un cÃ­rculo mÃ¡s grande en el juego de proyecciÃ³n, y de hecho mejorarÃ­a la precisiÃ³n. Sin embargo, tambiÃ©n aumentarÃ¡ la exposiciÃ³n a la pÃ©rdida de los fabricantes de mercado: el fabricante de mercado tendrÃ­a que bombear mÃ¡s dinero para lograr esto. El modelo de juego de proyecciÃ³n sugiere un enfoque natural para mejorar la precisiÃ³n al tiempo que conserva los mismos lÃ­mites de la pÃ©rdida de los fabricantes de mercado. La idea es que, en lugar de restringir todos los movimientos a estar en el cÃ­rculo unitario, obligamos a cada movimiento a tener un radio ligeramente mayor que el movimiento anterior. Supongamos que insistimos en que, si el radio actual es R, el prÃ³ximo comerciante tiene que moverse a R + 1. Entonces, el beneficio esperado de los operadores serÃ­a E = R (1 - cos (Î¸ - Î¸)). Usando la misma aproximaciÃ³n que anteriormente, el comerciante se negociarÃ­a tan tiempo que (Î¸ - Î¸) 2> 2 /r. Ahora, incluso si el fabricante de mercado sembrÃ³ el mercado con R = 1, aumentarÃ­a con cada comercio y los incentivos para agudizar el aumento de la estimaciÃ³n con cada comercio.5.2 AnÃ¡lisis de estrategias a largo plazo Hasta este punto, nuestro anÃ¡lisis se ha restringido a estrategias de comerciantes que son miopes en el sentido de que los comerciantes no consideran el impacto de sus operaciones en las creencias de otros comerciantes. En la prÃ¡ctica, un comerciante informado puede beneficiarse potencialmente jugando una estrategia subÃ³ptima para engaÃ±ar a otros comerciantes, de una manera que le permita beneficiarse mÃ¡s tarde. En esta secciÃ³n, ilustramos cÃ³mo se puede utilizar el juego de proyecciÃ³n para analizar una instancia de este fenÃ³meno y para diseÃ±ar reglas de mercado que mitigan este efecto. El escenario que consideramos es el siguiente. Hay dos operadores que especulan sobre la probabilidad de un evento E, cada uno de los cuales recibe una seÃ±al de 1 bits. La probabilidad Ã³ptima para cada par de seÃ±ales de 2 bits es la siguiente. Si el comerciante 1 obtiene la seÃ±al 0, y el comerciante 2 obtiene la seÃ±al 0, la probabilidad Ã³ptima es 0.3. Si el comerciante 1 obtuvo un 0, pero el comerciante 2 obtuvo un 1, la probabilidad Ã³ptima es 0.9. Si el comerciante 1 obtiene 1, y el comerciante 2 obtiene la seÃ±al 0, la probabilidad Ã³ptima es 0.7. Si el comerciante 1 obtuvo un 0, pero el comerciante 2 obtuvo un 1, la probabilidad Ã³ptima es 0.1.(Tenga en cuenta que el impacto de la seÃ±al del comerciante 2S estÃ¡ en una direcciÃ³n diferente, dependiendo de la seÃ±al del comerciante 1S). Suponga que la distribuciÃ³n previa de las seÃ±ales es que el comerciante 1 es igualmente probable que obtenga un 0 o un 1, pero el comerciante 2 obtiene un 0 con probabilidad 0.55 y un 1 con probabilidad 0.45. Los comerciantes estÃ¡n jugando el juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido a un arco circular. Esta configuraciÃ³n se representa en la Figura 4. A B D C X Y SeÃ±ales Opt. Pt 00 C D11 10 01 El evento no se hace dimensiones B A Figura 4: Ejemplo que ilustra el engaÃ±o no miopic supongo que, por alguna razÃ³n exÃ³gena, el comerciante 1 tiene la oportunidad de comerciar, seguido de Trader 2. Luego, el comerciante 1 tiene la opciÃ³n de colocar una operaciÃ³n de Ãºltima hora justo antes de que se cierre el mercado. Si los comerciantes estuvieran jugando sus estrategias miopicalmente Ã³ptimas, asÃ­ es como deberÃ­a funcionar el mercado: si el comerciante 1 ve un 0, se moverÃ­a a algÃºn punto Y que estÃ© entre A y C, pero mÃ¡s cercano a C. Trader 2 luego inferirÃ­a a ese comercianteRecibÃ­ una seÃ±al 0 y muÃ©vete a A o C si ella obtuvo 1 o 0 respectivamente. El comerciante 1 no tiene motivos para moverse nuevamente. Si Trader 1 hubiera obtenido un 1, Ã©l se mudarÃ­a a un punto diferente X, y Trader 2 se mudarÃ­a a D si viera 1 y B si viera 0. Nuevamente, el comerciante 1 no querrÃ­a volver a moverse. Usando el juego de proyecciÃ³n, es fÃ¡cil demostrar que, si los comerciantes consideran estrategias no miopas, este conjunto de estrategias no es un equilibrio. La posiciÃ³n exacta de los puntos no importa;Todo lo que necesitamos es la posiciÃ³n relativa, y la observaciÃ³n de que, debido a la simetrÃ­a perfecta en la configuraciÃ³n, los segmentos XY, BC y AD son paralelos entre sÃ­. Ahora, suponga que Trader 1 tiene un 0. PodrÃ­a mudarse a X en lugar de Y, para engaÃ±ar a Trader 2 para que piense que obtuvo un 1. Luego, cuando el comerciante 2 se moviÃ³ a, digamos, d, el comerciante 1 podrÃ­a corregir la calificaciÃ³n a A. Para demostrar que esta es una desviaciÃ³n rentable, observe que esta estrategia es equivalente a jugar dos movimientos adicionales sobre la estrategia miopel miopel de Trader 1s de mudarse a Y. El primer movimiento, y x puede moverse hacia o lejos de la posiciÃ³n final Ã³ptima. El segundo movimiento, DA o BC, siempre estÃ¡ en la direcciÃ³n correcta. AdemÃ¡s, debido a que DA y BC son mÃ¡s largos que XY, y paralelos a XY, su proyecciÃ³n en la lÃ­nea P final siempre serÃ¡ mayor 324 en valor absoluto que la proyecciÃ³n de XY, Â¡independientemente de cuÃ¡l sea la verdadera lÃ­nea P! Por lo tanto, el engaÃ±o darÃ­a como resultado una ganancia esperada estrictamente mayor para el comerciante 1. Tenga en cuenta que este problema no es especÃ­fico para la forma del juego de proyecciÃ³n: nuestros resultados de equivalencia muestran que podrÃ­a surgir en el MSR o DPM (tal vez con una distribuciÃ³n previa diferente y diferentes valores numÃ©ricos). Observe tambiÃ©n que un perfil de estrategia en el que ninguno de los comerciantes se moviÃ³ en las dos primeras rondas, y el comerciante 1 se moviÃ³ a X o Y serÃ­a un equilibrio perfecto para el subjuego en esta configuraciÃ³n. Sugerimos que un enfoque para mitigar este problema podrÃ­a ser reduciendo el radio en cada movimiento. Esto esencialmente proporciona una forma de descuento que motiva a Trader 1 a tomar sus ganancias temprano en lugar de engaÃ±ar al comerciante 2. GrÃ¡ficamente, el factor de reducciÃ³n correcto harÃ­a que los segmentos AD y BC sean mÃ¡s cortos que XY (ya que son acordes en un cÃ­rculo mÃ¡s pequeÃ±o), lo que hace que la estrategia miope sea Ã³ptima.6. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro hemos presentado un juego geomÃ©trico simple, el juego de proyecciÃ³n, que puede servir como modelo para el comportamiento estratÃ©gico en los mercados de informaciÃ³n, asÃ­ como una herramienta para guiar el diseÃ±o de nuevos mercados de informaciÃ³n. Hemos utilizado este modelo para analizar el costo, las ganancias y las estrategias de un comerciante en un mercado dinÃ¡mico parimutuel, y demostramos que tanto el mercado dinÃ¡mico parimutuel como la regla de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado esfÃ©rico son estratÃ©gicamente equivalentes al juego de proyecciÃ³n restringido bajo una ligera distorsiÃ³n delProbabilidades anteriores. El anÃ¡lisis general se basÃ³ en la suposiciÃ³n de que los comerciantes no intentan activamente engaÃ±ar a otros comerciantes para obtener ganancias futuras. En la SecciÃ³n 5, sin embargo, analizamos un pequeÃ±o mercado de ejemplo sin esta suposiciÃ³n. Demostramos que el juego de proyecciÃ³n se puede utilizar para analizar las estrategias de los comerciantes en este escenario y potencialmente para ayudar a diseÃ±ar mercados con mejores propiedades estratÃ©gicas. Nuestros resultados plantean varias preguntas abiertas muy interesantes. En primer lugar, los pagos del juego de proyecciÃ³n no se pueden implementar directamente en situaciones en las que la verdadera probabilidad no se revela en Ãºltima instancia. SerÃ­a muy Ãºtil tener una transformaciÃ³n automÃ¡tica de un juego de proyecciÃ³n dado en otro juego en el que los pagos se puedan implementar con expectativa sin conocer la probabilidad y preserva las propiedades estratÃ©gicas del juego de proyecciÃ³n. En segundo lugar, dada la estricta conexiÃ³n entre el juego de proyecciÃ³n y la regla de puntuaciÃ³n del mercado esfÃ©rico, es natural preguntar si podemos encontrar una conexiÃ³n tan fuerte con otras reglas de puntuaciÃ³n o si no, para comprender quÃ© diferencias estratÃ©gicas estÃ¡n implÃ­citas en la forma de la forma de la forma de la forma de la forma deregla de puntuaciÃ³n utilizada en el mercado. Finalmente, la existencia de estrategias manipuladoras de largo alcance en los mercados de la informaciÃ³n es de gran interÃ©s. El ejemplo que estudiamos en la SecciÃ³n 5 simplemente rasca la superficie de esta Ã¡rea. Un estudio general de esta clase de manipulaciones, junto con una caracterizaciÃ³n de los mercados en el que puede o no puede surgir, serÃ­a muy Ãºtil para el diseÃ±o de los mercados de la informaciÃ³n.7.

        "A Strategic Model for Information Markets Evdokia Nikolovaâˆ— MIT CSAIL Cambridge, MA nikolova @mit.edu Rahul Sami University of Michigan School of Information rsami @umich.edu ABSTRACT Information markets, which are designed specifically to aggregate traders information, are becoming increasingly popular as a means for predicting future events.",
        "Recent research in information markets has resulted in two new designs, market scoring rules and dynamic parimutuel markets.",
        "We develop an analytic method to guide the design and strategic analysis of information markets.",
        "Our central contribution is a new abstract betting game, the projection game, that serves as a useful model for information markets.",
        "We demonstrate that this game can serve as a strategic model of dynamic parimutuel markets, and also captures the essence of the strategies in market scoring rules.",
        "The projection game is tractable to analyze, and has an attractive geometric visualization that makes the strategic moves and interactions more transparent.",
        "We use it to prove several strategic properties about the dynamic parimutuel market.",
        "We also prove that a special form of the projection game is strategically equivalent to the spherical scoring rule, and it is strategically similar to other scoring rules.",
        "Finally, we illustrate two applications of the model to analysis of complex strategic scenarios: we analyze the precision of a market in which traders have inertia, and a market in which a trader can profit by manipulating another traders beliefs.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Economics, Theory 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Markets have long been used as a medium for trade.",
        "As a side effect of trade, the participants in a market reveal something about their preferences and beliefs.",
        "For example, in a financial market, agents would buy shares which they think are undervalued, and sell shares which they think are overvalued.",
        "It has long been observed that, because the market price is influenced by all the trades taking place, it aggregates the private information of all the traders.",
        "Thus, in a situation in which future events are uncertain, and each trader might have a little information, the aggregated information contained in the market prices can be used to predict future events.",
        "This has motivated the creation of information markets, which are mechanisms for aggregating the traders information about an uncertain event.",
        "Information markets can be modeled as a game in which the participants bet on a number of possible outcomes, such as the results of a presidential election, by buying shares of the outcomes and receiving payoffs when the outcome is realized.",
        "As in financial markets, the participants aim to maximize their profit by buying low and selling high.",
        "In this way, the players behavior transmits their personal information and beliefs about the possible outcomes, and can be used to predict the event more accurately.",
        "The benefit of well-designed information markets goes beyond information aggregation; they can also be used as a hedging instrument, to allow traders to insure against risk.",
        "Recently, researchers have turned to the problem of designing market structures specifically to achieve better information aggregation properties than traditional markets.",
        "Two designs for information markets have been proposed: the Dynamic Parimutuel Market (DPM) by Pennock [10] and the Market Scoring Rules (MSR) by Hanson [6].",
        "Both the DPM and the MSR were designed with the goal of giving informed traders an incentive to trade, and to reveal their information as soon as possible, while also controlling the subsidy that the market designer needs to pump into the market.",
        "The DPM was created as a combination of a pari-mutuel market (which is commonly used for betting on horses) and a continuous double auction, in order to simultaneously obtain the first ones infinite buy-in liquidity and the latters ability to react continuously to new information.",
        "One version of the DPM was implemented in the Yahoo!",
        "Buzz market [8] to experimentally test the markets prediction properties.",
        "The foundations of the MSR lie in the idea of a proper scoring rule, which is a technique to reward forecasters in a way that encourages them to give their best prediction. 316 The innovation in the MSR is to use these scoring rules as instruments that can be traded, thus providing traders who have new information an incentive to trade.",
        "The MSR was to be used in a policy analysis market in the Middle East [15], which was subsequently withdrawn.",
        "Information markets rely on informed traders trading for their own profit, so it is critical to understand the strategic properties of these markets.",
        "This is not an easy task, because markets are complex, and traders can influence each others beliefs through their trades, and hence, can potentially achieve long term gains by manipulating the market.",
        "For the MSR, it has been shown that, if we exclude the possibility of achieving gain through misleading other traders, it is optimal for each trader to honestly reflect her private belief in her trades.",
        "For the DPM, we are not aware of any prior strategic analysis of this nature; in fact, a strategic hole was discovered while testing the DPM in the Yahoo!",
        "Buzz market [8]. 1.1 Our Results In this paper, we seek to develop an analytic method to guide the design and strategic analysis of information markets.",
        "Our central contribution is a new abstract betting game, the projection 1 game, that serves as a useful model for information markets.",
        "The projection game is conceptually simpler than the MSR and DPM, and thus it is easier to analyze.",
        "In addition it has an attractive geometric visualization, which makes the strategic moves and interactions more transparent.",
        "We present an analysis of the optimal strategies and profits in this game.",
        "We then undertake an analysis of traders costs and profits in the dynamic parimutuel market.",
        "Remarkably, we find that the cost of a sequence of trades in the DPM is identical to the cost of the corresponding moves in the projection game.",
        "Further, if we assume that the traders beliefs at the end of trading match the true probability of the event being predicted, the traders payoffs and profits in the DPM are identical to their payoffs and profits in a corresponding projection game.",
        "We use the equivalence between the DPM and the projection game to prove that the DPM is arbitrage-free, deduce profitable strategies in the DPM, and demonstrate that constraints on the agents trades are necessary to prevent a strategic breakdown.",
        "We also prove an equivalence between the projection game and the MSR: We show that play in the MSR is strategically equivalent to play in a restricted projection game, at least for myopic strategies and small trades.",
        "In particular, the profitability of any move under the spherical scoring rule is exactly proportional to the profitability of the corresponding move in the projection game restricted to a circle, with slight distortion of the prior probabilities.",
        "This allows us to use the projection game as a conceptual model for market scoring rules.",
        "We note that while the MSR with the spherical scoring rule somewhat resembles the projection game, due to the mathematical similarity of their profit expressions, the DPM model is markedly different and thus its equivalence to the projection game is especially striking.",
        "Further, because the restricted projection game corresponds to a DPM with a natural trading constraint, this sheds light on an intriguing connection between the MSR and the DPM. 1 In an earlier version of this paper, we called this the segment game.",
        "Lastly, we illustrate how the projection game model can be used to analyze the potential for manipulation of information markets for long-term gain.2 We present an example scenario in which such manipulation can occur, and suggest additional rules that might mitigate the possibility of manipulation.",
        "We also illustrate another application to analyzing how a market maker can improve the prediction accuracy of a market in which traders will not trade unless their expected profit is above a threshold. 1.2 Related Work Numerous studies have demonstrated empirically that market prices are good predictors of future events, and seem to aggregate the collected wisdom of all the traders [2, 3, 12, 1, 5, 16].",
        "This effect has also been demonstrated in laboratory studies [13, 14], and has theoretical support in the literature of rational expectations [9].",
        "A number of recent studies have addressed the design of the market structure and trading rules for information markets, as well as the incentive to participate and other strategic issues.",
        "The two papers most closely related to our work are the papers by Hanson [6] and Pennock [10].",
        "However, strategic issues in information markets have also been studied by Mangold et al. [8] and by Hanson, Oprea and Porter [7].",
        "An upcoming survey paper [11] discusses costfunction formulations of automated market makers.",
        "Organization of the paper The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the projection game, and analyze the players costs, profits, and optimal strategies in this game.",
        "In Section 3, we study the dynamic parimutuel market, and show that trade in a DPM is equivalent to a projection game.",
        "We establish a connection between the projection game and the MSR in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze non-myopic, and potentially manipulative, actions.",
        "We present our conclusions, and suggestions for future work, in Section 6. 2.",
        "THE PROJECTION GAME In this section, we describe an abstract betting game, the projection game; in the following sections, we will argue that both the MSR and the DPM are strategically similar to the projection game.",
        "The projection game is conceptually simpler than MSR and DPM, and hence should prove easier to analyze.",
        "For clarity of exposition, here and in the rest of the paper we assume the space is two dimensional, i.e., there are only two possible events.",
        "Our results easily generalize to more than two dimensions.",
        "We also assume throughout that players are risk-neutral.",
        "Suppose there are two mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, A and B. (In other words, B is the same as not A.)",
        "There are n agents who may have information about the likelihood of A and B, and we (the designers) would like to aggregate their information.",
        "We invite them to play the game described below: At any point in the game, there is a current state described by a pair of parameters, (x, y), which we sometimes write in vector form as x.",
        "Intuitively, x corresponds to the 2 Here, we are referring only to manipulation of the information market for later gain from the market itself; we do not consider the possibility of traders having vested interests in the underlying events. 317 total holding of shares in A, and y corresponds to the holding of shares in B.",
        "In each move of the game, one player (say i) plays an arrow (or segment) from (x, y) to (x , y ).",
        "We use the notation [(x, y) â†’ (x , y )] or [x, x ] to denote this move.",
        "The game starts at (0, 0), but the market maker makes the first move; without loss of generality, we can assume the move is to (1, 1).",
        "All subsequent moves are made by players, in an arbitrary (and potentially repeating) sequence.",
        "Each move has a cost associated with it, given by C[x, x ] = |x | âˆ’ |x|, where | Â· | denotes the Euclidean norm, |x| = p x2 + y2.",
        "Note that none of the variables are constrained to be nonnegative, and hence, the cost of a move can be negative.",
        "The cost can be expressed in an alternative form, that is also useful.",
        "Suppose player i moves from (x, y) to (x , y ).",
        "We can write (x , y ) as (x + lex, y + ley), such that l â‰¥ 0 and |ex|2 + |ey|2 = 1.",
        "We call l the volume of the move, and (ex, ey) the direction of the move.",
        "At any point (Ë†x, Ë†y), there is an instantaneous price charged, defined as follows: c((Ë†x, Ë†y), (ex, ey)) = Ë†xex + Ë†yey |(Ë†x, Ë†y)| = Ë†x Â· e |Ë†x| .",
        "Note that the price depends only on the angle between the line joining the vector (Ë†x, Ë†y) and the segment [(x, y), (x , y )], and not the lengths.",
        "The total cost of the move is the price integrated over the segment [(x, y) â†’ (x , y )], i.e., C[(x, y) â†’ (x , y )] = Z l w=0 c((x+wex, y +wey), (ex, ey))dw We assume that the game terminates after a finite number of moves.",
        "At the end of the game, the true probability p of event A is determined, and the agents receive payoffs for the moves they made.",
        "Let q = (qx, qy) = (p,1âˆ’p) |(p,1âˆ’p)| .",
        "The payoff to agent i for a segment [(x, y) â†’ (x , y )] is given by: P([(x, y) â†’ (x , y )]) = qx(x âˆ’ x) + qy(y âˆ’ y) = q. (x âˆ’ x) We call the line through the origin with slope (1 âˆ’ p)/p = qy/qx the p-line.",
        "Note that the payoff, too, may be negative.",
        "One drawback of the definition of a projection game is that implementing the payoffs requires us to know the actual probability p. This is feasible if the probability can eventually be determined statistically, such as when predicting the relative frequency of different recurring events, or vote shares.",
        "It is also feasible for one-off events in which there is reason to believe that the true probability is either 0 or 1.",
        "For other one-off events, it cannot be implemented directly (unlike scoring rules, which can be implemented in expectation).",
        "However, we believe that even in these cases, the projection game can be useful as a conceptual and analytical tool.",
        "The moves, costs and payoffs have a natural geometric representation, which is shown in Figure 1 for three players with one move each.",
        "The players append directed line segments in turn, and the payoff player i finally receives for a move is the projection of her segment onto the line with slope (1 âˆ’ p)/p.",
        "Her cost is the difference of distances of the endpoints of her move to the origin. 2.1 Strategicproperties oftheprojectiongame We begin our strategic analysis of the projection game by observing the following simple path-independence property. 1âˆ’p p 3s m ove 1s payoff M M m ove 1s move 2smove 3s payoff 2s payoff x y Figure 1: A projection game with three players Lemma 1. [Path-Independence] Suppose there is a sequence of moves leading from (x, y) to (x , y ).",
        "Then, the total cost of all the moves is equal to the cost of the single move [(x, y) â†’ (x , y )], and the total payoff of all the moves is equal to the payoff of the single move [(x, y) â†’ (x , y )].",
        "Proof.",
        "The proof follows trivially from the definition of the costs and payoffs: If we consider a path from point x to point x , both the net change in the vector lengths and the net projection onto the p-line are completely determined by x and x .",
        "Although simple, path independence of profits is vitally important, because it implies (and is implied by) the absence of arbitrage in the market.",
        "In other words, there is no sequence of moves that start and end at the same point, but result in a positive profit.",
        "On the other hand, if there were two paths from (x, y) to (x , y ) with different profits, there would be a cyclic path with positive profit.",
        "For ease of reference, we summarize some more useful properties of the cost and payoff functions in the projection game.",
        "Lemma 2. 1.",
        "The instantaneous price for moving along a line through the origin is 1 or âˆ’1, when the move is away or toward the origin respectively.",
        "The instantaneous price along a circle centered at the origin is 0. 2.",
        "When x moves along a circle centered at the origin to point Â¯x on the positive p-line, the corresponding payoff is P(x, Â¯x) = |x| âˆ’ x Â· q, and the cost is C[x, Â¯x] = 0. 3.",
        "The two cost function formulations are equivalent: C[x, x ] = Z l w=0 cos(x + we, e)dw = |x |âˆ’|x| âˆ€x, x , where e is the unit vector giving the direction of move.",
        "In addition, when x moves along the positive p-line, the payoff is equal to the cost, P(x, x ) = |x | âˆ’ |x|.",
        "Proof. 1.",
        "The instantaneous price is c(x, e) = x Â· e/|x| = cos(x, e), where e is the direction of movement, and the result follows. 2.",
        "Since Â¯x is on the positive p-line, qÂ·Â¯x = |Â¯x| = |x|, hence P(x, Â¯x) = q Â· (Â¯x âˆ’ x) = |x| âˆ’ x Â· q; the cost is 0 from the definition. 318 3.",
        "From Part 1, the cost of moving from x to the origin is C[x, 0] = Z l w=0 cos(x + we, e)dw = Z l w=0 (âˆ’1)dw = âˆ’|x|, where l = |x|, e = x/|x|.",
        "By the path-independence property, C[x, x ] = C[x, 0] + C[0, x ] = |x | âˆ’ |x|.",
        "Finally, a point on the positive p-line gets projected to itself, namely q Â· x = |x| so when the movement is along the positive p-line, P(x, x ) = q Â· (x âˆ’ x) = |x | âˆ’ |x| = C[x, x ].",
        "We now consider the question of which moves are profitable in this game.",
        "The eventual profit of a move [x, x ], where x = x + l.(ex, ey), is profit[x, x ] = P[x, x ] âˆ’ C[x, x ] = lq.e âˆ’ C[x, x ] Differentiating with respect to l, we get d(profit) dl = q.e âˆ’ c(x + le, e) = q.e âˆ’ x + le |x + le| .e We observe that this is 0 if p(y + ley) = (1 âˆ’ p)(x + lex), in other words, when the vectors q and (x + le) are exactly aligned.",
        "Further, we observe that the price is non-decreasing with increasing l. Thus, along the direction e, the profit is maximized at the point of intersection with the p-line.",
        "By Lemma 2, there is always a path from x to the positive p-line with 0 cost, which is given by an arc of the circle with center at the origin and radius |x|.",
        "Also, any movement along the p-line has 0 additional profit.",
        "Thus, for any point x, we can define the profit potential Ï†(x, p) by Ï†(x, p) = |x| âˆ’ x Â· q.",
        "Note, the potential is positive for x off the positive p-line and zero for x on the line.",
        "Next we show that a move to a lower potential is always profitable.",
        "Lemma 3.",
        "The profit of a move [x, x ] is equal to the difference in potential Ï†(x, p) âˆ’ Ï†(x , p).",
        "Proof.",
        "Denote z = |x|q and z = |x |q, i.e., these are the points of intersection of the positive p-line with the circles centered at the origin with radii |x| and |x | respectively.",
        "By the path-independence property and Lemma 2, the profit of move [x, x ] is profit(x, x ) = profit(x, z) + profit(z, z ) + profit(z , x ) = (|x| âˆ’ x Â· q) + 0 + (x Â· q âˆ’ |x |) = Ï†(x, p) âˆ’ Ï†(x , p).",
        "Thus, the profit of the move is equal to the change in profit potential between the endpoints.",
        "This lemma offers another way of seeing that it is optimal to move to the point of lowest potential, namely to the p-line. p y 1âˆ’p x x x z z profit = |x|âˆ’x.q profit = x.qâˆ’|x| profit = 0 Figure 2: The profit of move [x, x ] is equal to the change in profit potential from x to x . 3.",
        "DYNAMIC PARIMUTUEL MARKETS The dynamic parimutuel market (DPM) was introduced by Pennock [10] as an information market structure that encourages informed traders to trade early, has guaranteed liquidity, and requires a bounded subsidy.",
        "This market structure was used in the Yahoo!",
        "Buzz market [8].",
        "In this section, we show that the dynamic parimutuel market is also remarkably similar to the projection game.",
        "Coupled with section 4, this also demonstrates a strong connection between the DPM and MSR.",
        "In a two-event DPM, users can place bets on either event A or B at any time, by buying a share in the appropriate event.",
        "The price of a share is variable, determined by the total amount of money in the market and the number of shares currently outstanding.",
        "Further, existing shares can be sold at the current price.",
        "After it is determined which event really happens, the shares are liquidated for cash.",
        "In the total-money-redistributed variant of DPM, which is the variant used in the Yahoo! market, the total money is divided equally among the shares of the winning event; shares of the losing event are worthless.",
        "Note that the payoffs are undefined if the event has zero outstanding shares; the DPM rules should preclude this possibility.",
        "We use the following notation: Let x be the number of outstanding shares of A (totalled over all traders), and y be the number of outstanding shares in B.",
        "Let M denote the total money currently in the market.",
        "Let cA and cB denote the prices of shares in A and B respectively.",
        "The price of a share in the Yahoo!",
        "DPM is determined by the share-ratio principle: cA cB = x y (1) The form of the prices can be fully determined by stipulating that, for any given value of M, x, and y, there must be some probability pA such that, if a trader believes that pA is the probability that A will occur and the market will liquidate in the current state, she cannot expect to profit from either buying or selling either share.",
        "This gives us cA = pA hM x i cB = pB hM y i 319 Since pA + pB = 1, we have: xcA + ycB = M (2) Finally, combining Equations 1 and 2, we get cA = x M x2 + y2 cB = y M x2 + y2 Cost of a trade in the DPM Consider a trader who comes to a DPM in state (M, x, y), and buys or sells shares such that the eventual state is (M , x , y ).",
        "What is the net cost, M âˆ’ M, of her move?",
        "Theorem 4.",
        "The cost of the move from (x, y) to (x , y ) is M âˆ’ M = M0[ p x 2 + y 2 âˆ’ p x2 + y2] for some constant M0.",
        "In other words, it is a constant multiple of the corresponding cost in the projection game.",
        "Proof.",
        "Consider the function G(x, y) = M0[ p x2 + y2].",
        "The function G is differentiable for all x, y = 0, and its partial derivatives are: âˆ‚G âˆ‚x = M0[ x p x2 + y2 ] = x G(x, y) x2 + y2 âˆ‚G âˆ‚y = M0[ y p x2 + y2 ] = y G(x, y) x2 + y2 Now, compare these equations to the prices in the DPM, and observe that, as a trader buys or sells in the DPM, the instantaneous price is the derivative of the money.",
        "It follows that, if at any point of time the DPM is in a state (M, x, y) such that M = G(x, y), then, at all subsequent points of time, the state (M , x , y ) of the DPM will satisfy M = G(x , y ).",
        "Finally, note that we can pick the constant M0 such that the equation is satisfied for the initial state of the DPM, and hence, it will always be satisfied.",
        "One important consequence of Theorem 4 is that the dynamic parimutuel market is arbitrage-free (using Lemma 1).",
        "It is interesting to note that the original Yahoo!",
        "Buzz market used a different pricing rule, which did permit arbitrage; the price rule was changed to the share-ratio rule after traders started exploiting the arbitrage opportunities [8].",
        "Another somewhat surprising consequence is that the numbers of outstanding shares x, y completely determines the total capitalization M of the DPM.",
        "Constraints in the DPM Although it might seem, based on the costs, that any move in the projection game has an equivalent move in the DPM, the DPM places some constraints on trades.",
        "Firstly, no trader is allowed to have a net negative holding in either share.",
        "This is important, because it ensures that the total holdings in each share are always positive.",
        "However, this is a boundary constraint, and does not impact the strategic choices for a player with a sufficiently large positive holding in each share.",
        "Thus, we can ignore this constraint from a first-order strategic analysis of the DPM.",
        "Secondly, for practical reasons a DPM will probably have a minimum unit of trade, but we assume here that arbitrarily small quantities can be traded.",
        "Payoffs in the DPM At some point, trading in the DPM ceases and shares are liquidated.",
        "We assume here that the true probability becomes known at liquidation time, and describe the payoffs in terms of the probability; however, if the probability is not revealed, only the event that actually occurs, these payoffs can be implemented in expectation.",
        "Suppose the DPM terminates in a state (M, x, y), and the true probability of event A is p. When the dynamic parimutuel market is liquidated, the shares are paid off in the following way: Each owner of a share of A receives pM x , and each owner of a share of B receives (1 âˆ’ p)M y , for each share owned.",
        "The payoffs in the DPM, although given by a fairly simple form, are conceptually complex, because the payoff of a move depends on the subsequent moves before the market liquidates.",
        "Thus, a fully rational choice of move in the DPM for player i should take into account the actions of subsequent players, including player i himself.",
        "Here, we restrict the analysis to myopic, infinitesimal strategies: Given the market position is (M, x, y), in which direction should a player make an infinitesimal move in order to maximize her profit?",
        "We show that the infinitesimal payoffs and profits of a DPM with true probability p correspond strategically to the infinitesimal payoffs and profits of a projection game with odds p p/(1 âˆ’ p), in the following sense: Lemma 5.",
        "Suppose player i is about to make a move in a dynamic parimutuel market in a state (M, x, y), and the true probability of event A is p. Then, assuming the market is liquidated after is move, â€¢ If x y < q p 1âˆ’p , player i profits by buying shares in A , or selling shares in B. â€¢ If x y > q p 1âˆ’p , player i profits by selling shares in A, or buying shares in B.",
        "Proof.",
        "Consider the cost and payoff of buying a small quantity Î”x of shares in A.",
        "The cost is C[(x, y) â†’ (x + Î”x, y)] = Î”x Â· x M x2+y2 , and the payoff is Î”x Â· pM x .",
        "Thus, buying the shares is profitable iff Î”x Â· x M x2 + y2 < Î”x Â· p M x â‡” x2 x2 + y2 < p â‡” x2 + y2 x2 > 1 p â‡” 1 + ( y x )2 > 1 p â‡” y x > r 1 âˆ’ p p â‡” x y < r p 1 âˆ’ p Thus, buying A is profitable if x y < q p 1âˆ’p , and selling A is profitable if x y > q p 1âˆ’p .",
        "The analysis for buying or selling B is similar, with p and (1 âˆ’ p) interchanged.",
        "It follows from Lemma 5 that it is myopically profitable for players to move towards the line with slope q 1âˆ’p p .",
        "Note that there is a one-to-one mapping between 1âˆ’p p and q 1âˆ’p p 320 in their respective ranges, so this line is uniquely defined, and each such line also corresponds to a unique p. However, because the actual payoff of a move depends on the future moves, players must base their decisions on some belief about the final state of the market.",
        "In the light of Lemma 5, one natural, rational-expectation style assumption is that the final state (M, xâˆ— , yâˆ— ) will satisfy xâˆ— yâˆ— = q p 1âˆ’p . (In other words, one might assume that the traders beliefs will ultimately converge to the true probability p; knowing p, the traders will drive the market state to satisfy x y = q p 1âˆ’p .)",
        "This is very plausible in markets (such as the Yahoo!",
        "Buzz market) in which trading is permitted right until the market is liquidated, at which point there is no remaining uncertainty about the relevant frequencies.",
        "Under this assumption, we can prove an even tighter connection between payoffs in the DPM (where the true probability is p) and payoffs in the projection game, with odds q p 1âˆ’p : Theorem 6.",
        "Suppose that the DPM ultimately terminates in a state (M, X, Y ) satisfying X Y = q p 1âˆ’p .",
        "Assume without loss of generality that the constant M0 = 1, so M =âˆš X2 + Y 2.",
        "Then, the final payoff for any move [x â†’ x ] made in the course of trading is (x âˆ’ x) Â· ( âˆš p, âˆš 1 âˆ’ p), i.e., it is the same as the payoff in the projection game with oddsq p 1âˆ’p .",
        "Proof.",
        "First, observe that X M = âˆš p and Y M = âˆš 1 âˆ’ p. The final payoff is the liquidation value of (x âˆ’ x) shares of A and (y âˆ’ y) shares of B, which is PayoffDP M [x âˆ’ x] = p M X (x âˆ’ x) + (1 âˆ’ p) M Y (y âˆ’ y) = p 1 âˆš p (x âˆ’ x) + (1 âˆ’ p) 1 âˆš 1 âˆ’ p (y âˆ’ y) = âˆš p(x âˆ’ x) + p 1 âˆ’ p(y âˆ’ y).",
        "Strategic Analysis for the DPM Theorems 4 and 6 give us a very strong equivalence between the projection game and the dynamic parimutuel market, under the assumption that the DPM converges to the optimal value for the true probability.",
        "A player playing in a DPM with true odds p/(1 âˆ’ p), can imagine himself playing in the projection game with odds q p 1âˆ’p , because both the costs and the payoffs of any given move are identical.",
        "Using this equivalence, we can transfer all the strategic properties proven for the projection game directly to the analysis of the dynamic parimutuel market.",
        "One particularly interesting conclusion we can draw is as follows: In the absence of any constraint that disallows it, it is always profitable for an agent to move towards the origin, by selling shares in both A and B while maintaining the ratio x/y.",
        "In the DPM, this is limited by forbidding short sales, so players can never have negative holdings in either share.",
        "As a result, when their holding in one share (say A) is 0, they cant use the strategy of moving towards the origin.",
        "We can conclude that a rational player should never hold shares of both A and B simultaneously, regardless of her beliefs and the market position.",
        "This discussion leads us to consider a modified DPM, in which this strategic loophole is addressed directly: Instead of disallowing all short sales, we place a constraint that no agent ever reduce the total market capitalization M (or, alternatively, that any agents total investment in the market is always non-negative).",
        "We call this the nondecreasing market capitalization constraint for the DPM.",
        "This corresponds to a restriction that no move in the projection game reduces the radius.",
        "However, we can conclude from the preceding discussion that players have no incentive to ever increase the radius.",
        "Thus, the moves of the projection game would all lie on the quarter circle in the positive quadrant, with radius determined by the market makers move.",
        "In section 4, we show that the projection game on this quarter circle is strategically equivalent (at least myopically) to trade in a Market Scoring Rule.",
        "Thus, the DPM and MSR appear to be deeply connected to each other, like different interfaces to the same underlying game. 4.",
        "MARKET SCORING RULES The Market Scoring Rule (MSR) was introduced by Hanson [6].",
        "It is based on the concept of a proper scoring rule, a technique which rewards forecasters to give their best prediction.",
        "Hansons innovation was to turn the scoring rules into instruments that can be traded, thereby providing traders who have new information an incentive to trade.",
        "One positive effect of this design is that a single trader would still have incentive to trade, which is equivalent to updating the scoring rule report to reflect her information, thereby eliminating the problem of thin markets and illiquidity.",
        "In this section, we show that, when the scoring rule used is the spherical scoring rule [4], there is a strong strategic equivalence between the projection game and the market scoring rule.",
        "Proper scoring rules are tools used to reward forecasters who predict the probability distribution of an event.",
        "We describe this in the simple setting of two exhaustive, mutually exclusive events A and B.",
        "In the simple setting of two exhaustive, mutually exclusive events A and B, proper scoring rules are defined as follows.",
        "Suppose the forecaster predicts that the probabilities of the events are r = (rA, rB), with rA + rB = 1.",
        "The scoring rule is specified by functions sA(rA, rB) and sB(rA, rB), which are applied as follows: If the event A occurs, the forecaster is paid sA(rA, rB), and if the event B occurs, the forecaster is paid sB(rA, rB).",
        "The key property that a proper scoring rule satisfies is that the expected payment is maximized when the report is identical to the true probability distribution. 4.1 Equivalence with Spherical Scoring Rule In this section, we focus on one specific scoring rule: the spherical scoring rule [4].",
        "Definition 1.",
        "The spherical scoring rule [4] is defined by si(r) def = ri/||r||.",
        "For two events, this can be written as: sA(rA, rB) = rA p r2 A + r2 B ; sB(rA, rB) = rB p r2 A + r2 B The spherical scoring rule is known to be a proper scoring rule.",
        "The definition generalizes naturally to higher dimensions.",
        "We now demonstrate a close connection between the projection game restricted to a circular arc and a market scoring rule that uses the spherical scoring rule.",
        "At this point, it is 321 convenient to use vector notation.",

        "Consider a player who changes the report from r to r .",
        "Then, if the true probability of A is p, her expected profit is SSR-PROFIT([r, r ]) = p(sA(r )âˆ’sA(r))+(1âˆ’p)(sB(r )âˆ’sB(r)) Now, let us represent the initial and final position in terms of circular coordinates.",

This immediately gives us the following strong strategic equivalence for the restricted projection game and the SSR market: Theorem 7.",

        "Then, X yields a greater payoff than X in the projection game iff X yields a greater payment than X in the SSR market.",
        "Proof.",
        "Every move [x, x ] has a corresponding inverse move [x , x].",
        "In both the projection game and the SSR, the inverse move profit is simply the negative profit of the move (the moves are reversible).",
        "We can define a collection of moves X = X âˆ’ X by adding the inverse of X to X .",
        "Note that SEG-PROFITp(X ) = SEG-PROFITp(X )âˆ’SEG-PROFITp(X ) and SSR-PROFITp(X ) = SSR-PROFITp(X )âˆ’SSR-PROFITp(X ); applying theorem 7 completes the proof.",
        "It follows that the ex post optimality of a move (or set of moves) is the same in both the projection game and the SSR market.",
        "On its own, this strong ex post equivalence is not completely satisfying, because in any non-trivial game there is uncertainty about the value of p, and the different scaling ratios for different p could lead to different ex ante optimal behavior.",

Then, there is a probability distribution G with the same support as F, and a strictly positive constant c that depends only on F such that: â€¢ (i) For any collection X of moves, the expected profits are related by: EF (SEG-PROFIT(X )) = cEG(SSR-PROFIT(X )) â€¢ (ii) For any collection X , and any measurable information set I âŠ† [0, 1], the expected profits conditioned on knowing that p âˆˆ I satisfy EF (SEG-PROFIT(X )|p âˆˆ I) = cEG(SSR-PROFIT(X )|p âˆˆ I) The converse also holds: For any probability distribution G, there is a distribution F such that both these statements are true.",

        "To the extent that strategies in these markets are independent of the specific scoring rule used, we can use the spherical scoring rule as the market instrument.",
        "Then, analysis of strategies in the projection game with a slightly distorted distribution over p can be used to understand the strategic properties of the original market situation.",
        "Implementation in expectation Another important consequence of Theorem 9 is that the restricted projection game can be implemented with a small distortion in the probability distribution over values of p, by using a Spherical Scoring Rule to implement the payoffs.",
        "This makes the projection game valuable as a design tool; for example, we can analyze new constraints and rules in the projection game, and then implement them via the SSR.",
        "Unfortunately, the result does not extend to unrestricted projection games, because the relative profit of moving along the circle versus changing radius is not preserved through this transformation.",
        "However, it is possible to extend the transformation to projection games in which the radius ri after the ith move is a fixed function of i (not necessarily constant), so that it is not within the strategic control of the player making the move; such games can also be strategically implemented via the spherical scoring rule (with distortion of priors). 4.2 Connection to other scoring rules In this section, we show a weaker similarity between the projection game and the MSR with other scoring rules.",
        "We prove an infinitesimal similarity between the restricted projection game and the MSR with log scoring rule; the result generalizes to all proper scoring rules that have a unique local and global maximum.",
        "A geometric visualization of some common scoring rules in two dimensions is depicted in Figure 3.",
        "The score curves in the figure are defined by {(s1(r), s2(r)) | r = (r, 1 âˆ’ r), r âˆˆ [0, 1]}.",
        "Similarly to the projection game, define the profit potential of a probability r in MSR to be the change in profit for moving from r to the optimum p, Ï†MSR(s(r), p) = profitMSR[s(r), s(p)].",
        "We will show that the profit potentials in the two games have analogous roles for analyzing the optimal strategies, in particular both potential functions have a global minimum 0 at r = p. Theorem 10.",

        "Trade in a log market scoring rule is strategically similar to trade in the projection game on the quarter-circle, in that d dr Ï†(s(r), p) < 0 for r < p d dr Ï†(s(r), p) > 0 for r > p, both for the projection game and MSR potentials Ï†(.).",
        "Proof. (sketch) The derivative of the MSR potential is d dr Ï†(s(r), p) = âˆ’p Â· d dr s(r) = âˆ’ X i pisi(r).",

        "The potential for any x = ( r |r| , 1âˆ’r |r| ) is given by Ï†(x(r), p) = |x| âˆ’ q Â· x(r), It is easy to show that d dr Ï†(x(r), p) < 0 for r < p and the derivative is positive for r > p, so the potential function along the circle is decreasing and then increasing with r similarly to an energy function, with a global minimum at r = p, as desired.",
        "Theorem 10 establishes that the market log-scoring rule is strategically similar to the projection game played on a circle, in the sense that the optimal direction of movement at the current state is the same in both games.",
        "For example, if the current state is r < p, it is profitable to move to r+dr since the effective profit of that move is profit(r, r ) = Ï†(s(r), p) âˆ’ Ï†(s(r + dr), p) > 0.",

        "USING THEPROJECTION-GAMEMODEL The chief advantages of the projection game are that it is analytically tractable, and also easy to visualize.",
        "In Section 3, we used the projection-game model of the DPM to prove the absence of arbitrage, and to infer strategic properties that might have been difficult to deduce otherwise.",
        "In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about more complex strategic settings. 323 5.1 Traders with inertia The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the market forms we have studied asserts that traders who disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to trade in the market.",
        "The expected gain may, however, be very small.",
        "A plausible model of real trader behavior might include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than some constant .",
        "We do not attempt to justify this model here; rather, we illustrate how the projection game may be used to analyze such situations, and shed some light on how to modify the trading rules to alleviate this problem.",
        "Consider the simple projection game restricted to a circular arc with unit radius; as we have seen, this corresponds closely to the spherical market scoring rule, and to the dynamic parimutuel market under a reasonable constraint.",
        "Now, suppose the market probability is p, and a trader believes the true probability is p .",
        "Then, his expected gain can be calculated, as follows: Let q and q be the unit vectors in the directions of p and p respectively.",
        "The expected profit is given by E = Ï†(q, p ) = 1âˆ’ q Â·q .",
        "Thus, the trader will trade only if 1âˆ’qÂ·q > .",
        "If we let Î¸ and Î¸ be the angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis), we get E = 1 âˆ’ cos(Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ ); when Î¸ is close to Î¸ , a Taylor series approximation gives us that E â‰ˆ (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )2 /2.",
        "Thus, we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy: The market price will not change as long as (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )2 â‰¤ 2 .",
        "Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market.",
        "One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.",
        "This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy.",
        "However, it will also increase the market-makers exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this.",
        "The projection game model suggests a natural approach to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds on the market makers loss.",
        "The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move.",
        "Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1.",
        "Then, the traders expected profit would be E = r(1 âˆ’ cos(Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )).",
        "Using the same approximation as above, the trader would trade as long as (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )2 > 2 /r.",
        "Now, even if the market maker seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase with every trade. 5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not consider the impact of their trades on other traders beliefs.",
        "In practice, an informed trader can potentially profit by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders, in a way that allows her to profit later.",
        "In this section, we illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze an instance of this phenomenon, and to design market rules that mitigate this effect.",
        "The scenario we consider is as follows.",
        "There are two traders speculating on the probability of an event E, who each get a 1-bit signal.",

        "If traders were playing their myopically optimal strategies, here is how the market should run: If trader 1 sees a 0, he would move to some point Y that is between A and C, but closer to C. Trader 2 would then infer that trader 1 received a 0 signal and move to A or C if she got 1 or 0 respectively.",
        "Trader 1 has no reason to move again.",

        "Using the projection game, it is easy to show that, if traders consider non-myopic strategies, this set of strategies is not an equilibrium.",
        "The exact position of the points does not matter; all we need is the relative position, and the observation that, because of the perfect symmetry in the setup, segments XY, BC, and AD are all parallel to each other.",
        "Now, suppose trader 1 got a 0.",
        "He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.",
        "Then, when trader 2 moved to, say, D, trader 1 could correct the rating to A.",
        "To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to playing two additional moves over trader 1s myopic strategy of moving to Y .",
        "The first move, Y X may either move toward or away from the optimal final position.",
        "The second move, DA or BC, is always in the correct direction.",
        "Further, because DA and BC are longer than XY , and parallel to XY , their projection on the final p-line will always be greater 324 in absolute value than the projection of XY , regardless of what the true p-line is!",
        "Thus, the deception would result in a strictly higher expected profit for trader 1.",
        "Note that this problem is not specific to the projection game form: Our equivalence results show that it could arise in the MSR or DPM (perhaps with a different prior distribution and different numerical values).",
        "Observe also that a strategy profile in which neither trader moved in the first two rounds, and trader 1 moved to either X or Y would be a subgame-perfect equilibrium in this setup.",
        "We suggest that one approach to mitigating this problem might be by reducing the radius at every move.",
        "This essentially provides a form of discounting that motivates trader 1 to take his profit early rather than mislead trader 2.",
        "Graphically, the right reduction factor would make the segments AD and BC shorter than XY (as they are chords on a smaller circle), thus making the myopic strategy optimal. 6.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented a simple geometric game, the projection game, that can serve as a model for strategic behavior in information markets, as well as a tool to guide the design of new information markets.",

        "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",

                "We note that while the MSR with the spherical scoring rule somewhat resembles the projection game, due to the mathematical similarity of their profit expressions, the DPM model is markedly different and thus its equivalence to the projection game is especially striking.",

                "Lastly, we illustrate how the projection game model can be used to analyze the potential for manipulation of information markets for long-term gain.2 We present an example scenario in which such manipulation can occur, and suggest additional rules that might mitigate the possibility of manipulation.",
                "We also illustrate another application to analyzing how a market maker can improve the prediction accuracy of a market in which traders will not trade unless their expected profit is above a threshold. 1.2 Related Work Numerous studies have demonstrated empirically that market prices are good predictors of future events, and seem to aggregate the collected wisdom of all the traders [2, 3, 12, 1, 5, 16].",

                "Proof.",
                "The proof follows trivially from the definition of the costs and payoffs: If we consider a path from point x to point x , both the net change in the vector lengths and the net projection onto the p-line are completely determined by x and x .",
                "Although simple, path independence of profits is vitally important, because it implies (and is implied by) the absence of arbitrage in the market.",

                "On the other hand, if there were two paths from (x, y) to (x , y ) with different profits, there would be a cyclic path with positive profit.",

                "We demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties.",
                "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
                "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",
                "A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.",

                "He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.",
                "Then, when trader 2 moved to, say, D, trader 1 could correct the rating to A.",
                "To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to playing two additional moves over trader 1s myopic strategy of moving to Y .",

                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented a simple geometric game, the projection game, that can serve as a model for strategic behavior in information markets, as well as a tool to guide the design of new information markets.",
                "We have used this model to analyze the cost, profit, and strategies of a trader in a <br>dynamic parimutuel market</br>, and shown that both the <br>dynamic parimutuel market</br> and the spherical market scoring rule are strategically equivalent to the restricted projection game under slight distortion of the prior probabilities.",
                "The general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit.",
                "In section 5, however, we analyze a small example market without this assumption.",
                "We demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties.",
                "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
                "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",
                "A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.",

                "In Section 3, we used the projection-game model of the DPM to prove the absence of arbitrage, and to infer strategic properties that might have been difficult to deduce otherwise.",
                "In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about more complex strategic settings. 323 5.1 Traders with inertia The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the market forms we have studied asserts that traders who disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to trade in the market.",
                "The expected gain may, however, be very small.",
                "A plausible model of real trader behavior might include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than some constant .",
                "We do not attempt to justify this model here; rather, we illustrate how the projection game may be used to analyze such situations, and shed some light on how to modify the trading rules to alleviate this problem.",

                "Thus, the trader will trade only if 1âˆ’qÂ·q > .",
                "If we let Î¸ and Î¸ be the angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis), we get E = 1 âˆ’ cos(Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ ); when Î¸ is close to Î¸ , a Taylor series approximation gives us that E â‰ˆ (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )2 /2.",
                "Thus, we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy: The market price will not change as long as (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )2 â‰¤ 2 .",
                "Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market.",
                "One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.",
                "This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy.",
                "However, it will also increase the market-makers exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this.",
                "The projection game model suggests a natural approach to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds on the market makers loss.",
                "The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move.",
                "Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1.",
                "Then, the traders expected profit would be E = r(1 âˆ’ cos(Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )).",
                "Using the same approximation as above, the trader would trade as long as (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )2 > 2 /r.",
                "Now, even if the market maker seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase with every trade. 5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not consider the impact of their trades on other traders beliefs.",
                "In practice, an informed trader can potentially profit by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders, in a way that allows her to profit later.",

                "Suppose that the prior distribution of the signals is that trader 1 is equally likely to get a 0 or a 1, but trader 2 gets a 0 with probability 0.55 and a 1 with probability 0.45.",
                "The traders are playing the projection game restricted to a circular arc.",

                "If traders were playing their myopically optimal strategies, here is how the market should run: If trader 1 sees a 0, he would move to some point Y that is between A and C, but closer to C. Trader 2 would then infer that trader 1 received a 0 signal and move to A or C if she got 1 or 0 respectively.",

                "Using the projection game, it is easy to show that, if traders consider non-myopic strategies, this set of strategies is not an equilibrium.",
                "The exact position of the points does not matter; all we need is the relative position, and the observation that, because of the perfect symmetry in the setup, segments XY, BC, and AD are all parallel to each other.",
                "Now, suppose trader 1 got a 0.",
                "He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.",
                "Then, when trader 2 moved to, say, D, trader 1 could correct the rating to A.",
                "To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to playing two additional moves over trader 1s myopic strategy of moving to Y .",

                "The second move, DA or BC, is always in the correct direction.",

                "Thus, the deception would result in a strictly higher expected profit for trader 1.",
                "Note that this problem is not specific to the projection game form: Our equivalence results show that it could arise in the MSR or DPM (perhaps with a different prior distribution and different numerical values).",
                "Observe also that a strategy profile in which neither trader moved in the first two rounds, and trader 1 moved to either X or Y would be a subgame-perfect equilibrium in this setup.",

                "Graphically, the right reduction factor would make the segments AD and BC shorter than XY (as they are chords on a smaller circle), thus making the myopic strategy optimal. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented a simple geometric game, the projection game, that can serve as a model for strategic behavior in information markets, as well as a tool to guide the design of new information markets.",
                "We have used this model to analyze the cost, profit, and strategies of a trader in a dynamic parimutuel market, and shown that both the dynamic parimutuel market and the spherical market scoring rule are strategically equivalent to the restricted projection game under slight distortion of the prior probabilities.",
                "The general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit.",
                "In section 5, however, we analyze a small example market without this assumption.",
                "We demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties.",
                "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
                "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",
                "A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.",

                "In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about more complex strategic settings. 323 5.1 Traders with inertia The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the market forms we have studied asserts that traders who disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to trade in the market.",
                "The expected gain may, however, be very small.",
                "A plausible model of real trader behavior might include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than some constant .",

                "One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.",
                "This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy.",

                "The general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit.",
                "In section 5, however, we analyze a small example market without this assumption.",
                "We demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties.",
                "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
                "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of <br>long-range manipulative strategies</br> in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",

                "The expected gain may, however, be very small.",

                "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
                "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",
                "A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.",

                "The general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit.",

                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",

                "In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about more complex strategic settings. 323 5.1 Traders with inertia The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the market forms we have studied asserts that traders who disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to trade in the market.",
                "The expected gain may, however, be very small.",
                "A plausible model of real trader behavior might include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than some constant .",
                "We do not attempt to justify this model here; rather, we illustrate how the projection game may be used to analyze such situations, and shed some light on how to modify the trading rules to alleviate this problem.",

                "If we let Î¸ and Î¸ be the angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis), we get E = 1 âˆ’ cos(Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ ); when Î¸ is close to Î¸ , a Taylor series approximation gives us that E â‰ˆ (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )2 /2.",

                "One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.",
                "This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy.",
                "However, it will also increase the market-makers exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this.",
                "The projection game model suggests a natural approach to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds on the market makers loss.",
                "The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move.",
                "Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1.",

                "Now, even if the market maker seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase with every trade. 5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not consider the impact of their trades on other traders beliefs.",
                "In practice, an informed trader can potentially profit by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders, in a way that allows her to profit later.",

                "Suppose that the prior distribution of the signals is that trader 1 is equally likely to get a 0 or a 1, but trader 2 gets a 0 with probability 0.55 and a 1 with probability 0.45.",

                "He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.",

                "We demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties.",
                "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
                "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",
                "A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.",

                "It has long been observed that, because the market price is influenced by all the trades taking place, it aggregates the private information of all the traders.",
                "Thus, in a situation in which future events are uncertain, and each trader might have a little information, the aggregated information contained in the market prices can be used to predict future events.",
                "This has motivated the creation of information markets, which are mechanisms for aggregating the traders information about an uncertain event.",
                "Information markets can be modeled as a game in which the participants bet on a number of possible outcomes, such as the results of a presidential election, by buying shares of the outcomes and receiving payoffs when the outcome is realized.",
                "As in financial markets, the participants aim to maximize their profit by buying low and selling high.",
                "In this way, the players behavior transmits their personal information and beliefs about the possible outcomes, and can be used to predict the event more accurately.",
                "The benefit of well-designed information markets goes beyond information aggregation; they can also be used as a hedging instrument, to allow traders to insure against risk.",
                "Recently, researchers have turned to the problem of designing market structures specifically to achieve better information aggregation properties than traditional markets.",
                "Two designs for information markets have been proposed: the Dynamic Parimutuel Market (DPM) by Pennock [10] and the Market Scoring Rules (MSR) by Hanson [6].",
                "Both the DPM and the MSR were designed with the goal of giving informed traders an incentive to trade, and to reveal their information as soon as possible, while also controlling the subsidy that the market designer needs to pump into the market.",
                "The DPM was created as a combination of a pari-mutuel market (which is commonly used for betting on horses) and a continuous double auction, in order to simultaneously obtain the first ones infinite buy-in liquidity and the latters ability to react continuously to new information.",

                "The foundations of the MSR lie in the idea of a proper scoring rule, which is a technique to reward forecasters in a way that encourages them to give their best prediction. 316 The innovation in the MSR is to use these scoring rules as instruments that can be traded, thus providing traders who have new information an incentive to trade.",
                "The MSR was to be used in a policy analysis market in the Middle East [15], which was subsequently withdrawn.",
                "Information markets rely on informed traders trading for their own profit, so it is critical to understand the strategic properties of these markets.",
                "This is not an easy task, because markets are complex, and traders can influence each others beliefs through their trades, and hence, can potentially achieve long term gains by manipulating the market.",
                "For the MSR, it has been shown that, if we exclude the possibility of achieving gain through misleading other traders, it is optimal for each trader to honestly reflect her private belief in her trades.",
                "For the DPM, we are not aware of any prior strategic analysis of this nature; in fact, a strategic hole was discovered while testing the DPM in the Yahoo!",

                "Further, if we assume that the traders beliefs at the end of trading match the true probability of the event being predicted, the traders payoffs and profits in the DPM are identical to their payoffs and profits in a corresponding <br>projection game</br>.",
                "We use the equivalence between the DPM and the <br>projection game</br> to prove that the DPM is arbitrage-free, deduce profitable strategies in the DPM, and demonstrate that constraints on the agents trades are necessary to prevent a strategic breakdown.",
                "We also prove an equivalence between the <br>projection game</br> and the MSR: We show that play in the MSR is strategically equivalent to play in a restricted <br>projection game</br>, at least for myopic strategies and small trades.",
                "In particular, the profitability of any move under the spherical scoring rule is exactly proportional to the profitability of the corresponding move in the <br>projection game</br> restricted to a circle, with slight distortion of the prior probabilities.",
                "This allows us to use the <br>projection game</br> as a conceptual model for market scoring rules.",
                "We note that while the MSR with the spherical scoring rule somewhat resembles the <br>projection game</br>, due to the mathematical similarity of their profit expressions, the DPM model is markedly different and thus its equivalence to the <br>projection game</br> is especially striking.",
                "Further, because the restricted <br>projection game</br> corresponds to a DPM with a natural trading constraint, this sheds light on an intriguing connection between the MSR and the DPM. 1 In an earlier version of this paper, we called this the segment game.",
                "Lastly, we illustrate how the <br>projection game</br> model can be used to analyze the potential for manipulation of information markets for long-term gain.2 We present an example scenario in which such manipulation can occur, and suggest additional rules that might mitigate the possibility of manipulation.",
                "We also illustrate another application to analyzing how a market maker can improve the prediction accuracy of a market in which traders will not trade unless their expected profit is above a threshold. 1.2 Related Work Numerous studies have demonstrated empirically that market prices are good predictors of future events, and seem to aggregate the collected wisdom of all the traders [2, 3, 12, 1, 5, 16].",
                "This effect has also been demonstrated in laboratory studies [13, 14], and has theoretical support in the literature of rational expectations [9].",
                "A number of recent studies have addressed the design of the market structure and trading rules for information markets, as well as the incentive to participate and other strategic issues.",

                "In Section 3, we study the dynamic parimutuel market, and show that trade in a DPM is equivalent to a <br>projection game</br>.",

                "Consider the simple <br>projection game</br> restricted to a circular arc with unit radius; as we have seen, this corresponds closely to the spherical market scoring rule, and to the dynamic parimutuel market under a reasonable constraint.",
                "Now, suppose the market probability is p, and a trader believes the true probability is p .",
                "Then, his expected gain can be calculated, as follows: Let q and q be the unit vectors in the directions of p and p respectively.",
                "The expected profit is given by E = Ï†(q, p ) = 1âˆ’ q Â·q .",

                "Thus, we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy: The market price will not change as long as (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ )2 â‰¤ 2 .",
                "Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market.",
                "One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.",
                "This corresponds to using a larger circle in the <br>projection game</br>, and would indeed improve the accuracy.",
                "However, it will also increase the market-makers exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this.",

                "The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move.",
                "Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1.",

                "In practice, an informed trader can potentially profit by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders, in a way that allows her to profit later.",
                "In this section, we illustrate how the <br>projection game</br> can be used to analyze an instance of this phenomenon, and to design market rules that mitigate this effect.",
                "The scenario we consider is as follows.",
                "There are two traders speculating on the probability of an event E, who each get a 1-bit signal.",
                "The optimal probability for each 2bit signal pair is as follows.",
                "If trader 1 gets the signal 0, and trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal probability is 0.3.",
                "If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is 0.9.",
                "If trader 1 gets 1, and trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal probability is 0.7.",
                "If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is 0.1. (Note that the impact of trader 2s signal is in a different direction, depending on trader 1s signal).",
                "Suppose that the prior distribution of the signals is that trader 1 is equally likely to get a 0 or a 1, but trader 2 gets a 0 with probability 0.55 and a 1 with probability 0.45.",
                "The traders are playing the <br>projection game</br> restricted to a circular arc.",
                "This setup is depicted in Figure 4.",

                "Pt 00 C D11 10 01 Event does not happenEventhappens B A Figure 4: Example illustrating non-myopic deception Suppose that, for some exogenous reason, trader 1 has the opportunity to trade, followed by trader 2.",
                "Then, trader 1 has the option of placing a last-minute trade just before the market closes.",
                "If traders were playing their myopically optimal strategies, here is how the market should run: If trader 1 sees a 0, he would move to some point Y that is between A and C, but closer to C. Trader 2 would then infer that trader 1 received a 0 signal and move to A or C if she got 1 or 0 respectively.",
                "Trader 1 has no reason to move again.",
                "If trader 1 had got a 1, he would move to a different point X instead, and trader 2 would move to D if she saw 1 and B if she saw 0.",

                "Using the <br>projection game</br>, it is easy to show that, if traders consider non-myopic strategies, this set of strategies is not an equilibrium.",
                "The exact position of the points does not matter; all we need is the relative position, and the observation that, because of the perfect symmetry in the setup, segments XY, BC, and AD are all parallel to each other.",
                "Now, suppose trader 1 got a 0.",
                "He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.",
                "Then, when trader 2 moved to, say, D, trader 1 could correct the rating to A.",
                "To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to playing two additional moves over trader 1s myopic strategy of moving to Y .",
                "The first move, Y X may either move toward or away from the optimal final position.",
                "The second move, DA or BC, is always in the correct direction.",
                "Further, because DA and BC are longer than XY , and parallel to XY , their projection on the final p-line will always be greater 324 in absolute value than the projection of XY , regardless of what the true p-line is!",
                "Thus, the deception would result in a strictly higher expected profit for trader 1.",
                "Note that this problem is not specific to the <br>projection game</br> form: Our equivalence results show that it could arise in the MSR or DPM (perhaps with a different prior distribution and different numerical values).",
                "Observe also that a strategy profile in which neither trader moved in the first two rounds, and trader 1 moved to either X or Y would be a subgame-perfect equilibrium in this setup.",
                "We suggest that one approach to mitigating this problem might be by reducing the radius at every move.",
                "This essentially provides a form of discounting that motivates trader 1 to take his profit early rather than mislead trader 2.",
                "Graphically, the right reduction factor would make the segments AD and BC shorter than XY (as they are chords on a smaller circle), thus making the myopic strategy optimal. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented a simple geometric game, the <br>projection game</br>, that can serve as a model for strategic behavior in information markets, as well as a tool to guide the design of new information markets.",
                "We have used this model to analyze the cost, profit, and strategies of a trader in a dynamic parimutuel market, and shown that both the dynamic parimutuel market and the spherical market scoring rule are strategically equivalent to the restricted <br>projection game</br> under slight distortion of the prior probabilities.",
                "The general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit.",
                "In section 5, however, we analyze a small example market without this assumption.",
                "We demonstrate that the <br>projection game</br> can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties.",
                "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
                "Firstly, the payoffs of the <br>projection game</br> cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given <br>projection game</br> into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the <br>projection game</br>.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the <br>projection game</br> and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",
                "A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.",
