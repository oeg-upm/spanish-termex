The projection game is tractable to analyze, and has an attractive geometric visualization that makes the strategic moves and interactions more transparent. We use it to prove several strategic properties about the dynamic parimutuel market. We also prove that a special form of the projection game is strategically equivalent to the spherical scoring rule, and it is strategically similar to other scoring rules. Finally, we illustrate two applications of the model to analysis of complex strategic scenarios: we analyze the precision of a market in which traders have inertia, and a market in which a trader can profit by manipulating another traders beliefs.

INTRODUCTION Markets have long been used as a medium for trade. As a side effect of trade, the participants in a market reveal something about their preferences and beliefs. For example, in a financial market, agents would buy shares which they think are undervalued, and sell shares which they think are overvalued. It has long been observed that, because the market price is influenced by all the trades taking place, it aggregates the private information of all the traders. Thus, in a situation in which future events are uncertain, and each trader might have a little information, the aggregated information contained in the market prices can be used to predict future events. This has motivated the creation of information markets, which are mechanisms for aggregating the traders information about an uncertain event. Information markets can be modeled as a game in which the participants bet on a number of possible outcomes, such as the results of a presidential election, by buying shares of the outcomes and receiving payoffs when the outcome is realized. As in financial markets, the participants aim to maximize their profit by buying low and selling high. In this way, the players behavior transmits their personal information and beliefs about the possible outcomes, and can be used to predict the event more accurately. The benefit of well-designed information markets goes beyond information aggregation; they can also be used as a hedging instrument, to allow traders to insure against risk. Recently, researchers have turned to the problem of designing market structures specifically to achieve better information aggregation properties than traditional markets. Two designs for information markets have been proposed: the Dynamic Parimutuel Market (DPM) by Pennock [10] and the Market Scoring Rules (MSR) by Hanson [6]. Both the DPM and the MSR were designed with the goal of giving informed traders an incentive to trade, and to reveal their information as soon as possible, while also controlling the subsidy that the market designer needs to pump into the market. The DPM was created as a combination of a pari-mutuel market (which is commonly used for betting on horses) and a continuous double auction, in order to simultaneously obtain the first ones infinite buy-in liquidity and the latters ability to react continuously to new information. One version of the DPM was implemented in the Yahoo! Buzz market [8] to experimentally test the markets prediction properties. The foundations of the MSR lie in the idea of a proper scoring rule, which is a technique to reward forecasters in a way that encourages them to give their best prediction. 316 The innovation in the MSR is to use these scoring rules as instruments that can be traded, thus providing traders who have new information an incentive to trade. The MSR was to be used in a policy analysis market in the Middle East [15], which was subsequently withdrawn. Information markets rely on informed traders trading for their own profit, so it is critical to understand the strategic properties of these markets. This is not an easy task, because markets are complex, and traders can influence each others beliefs through their trades, and hence, can potentially achieve long term gains by manipulating the market. For the MSR, it has been shown that, if we exclude the possibility of achieving gain through misleading other traders, it is optimal for each trader to honestly reflect her private belief in her trades. For the DPM, we are not aware of any prior strategic analysis of this nature; in fact, a strategic hole was discovered while testing the DPM in the Yahoo! Buzz market [8]. 1.1 Our Results In this paper, we seek to develop an analytic method to guide the design and strategic analysis of information markets. Our central contribution is a new abstract betting game, the projection 1 game, that serves as a useful model for information markets. The projection game is conceptually simpler than the MSR and DPM, and thus it is easier to analyze. In addition it has an attractive geometric visualization, which makes the strategic moves and interactions more transparent. We present an analysis of the optimal strategies and profits in this game. We then undertake an analysis of traders costs and profits in the dynamic parimutuel market. Remarkably, we find that the cost of a sequence of trades in the DPM is identical to the cost of the corresponding moves in the projection game. Further, if we assume that the traders beliefs at the end of trading match the true probability of the event being predicted, the traders payoffs and profits in the DPM are identical to their payoffs and profits in a corresponding projection game. We use the equivalence between the DPM and the projection game to prove that the DPM is arbitrage-free, deduce profitable strategies in the DPM, and demonstrate that constraints on the agents trades are necessary to prevent a strategic breakdown. We also prove an equivalence between the projection game and the MSR: We show that play in the MSR is strategically equivalent to play in a restricted projection game, at least for myopic strategies and small trades. In particular, the profitability of any move under the spherical scoring rule is exactly proportional to the profitability of the corresponding move in the projection game restricted to a circle, with slight distortion of the prior probabilities. This allows us to use the projection game as a conceptual model for market scoring rules. We note that while the MSR with the spherical scoring rule somewhat resembles the projection game, due to the mathematical similarity of their profit expressions, the DPM model is markedly different and thus its equivalence to the projection game is especially striking. Further, because the restricted projection game corresponds to a DPM with a natural trading constraint, this sheds light on an intriguing connection between the MSR and the DPM. 1 In an earlier version of this paper, we called this the segment game. Lastly, we illustrate how the projection game model can be used to analyze the potential for manipulation of information markets for long-term gain.2 We present an example scenario in which such manipulation can occur, and suggest additional rules that might mitigate the possibility of manipulation. We also illustrate another application to analyzing how a market maker can improve the prediction accuracy of a market in which traders will not trade unless their expected profit is above a threshold. 1.2 Related Work Numerous studies have demonstrated empirically that market prices are good predictors of future events, and seem to aggregate the collected wisdom of all the traders [2, 3, 12, 1, 5, 16]. This effect has also been demonstrated in laboratory studies [13, 14], and has theoretical support in the literature of rational expectations [9]. A number of recent studies have addressed the design of the market structure and trading rules for information markets, as well as the incentive to participate and other strategic issues. The two papers most closely related to our work are the papers by Hanson [6] and Pennock [10]. However, strategic issues in information markets have also been studied by Mangold et al. [8] and by Hanson, Oprea and Porter [7]. An upcoming survey paper [11] discusses costfunction formulations of automated market makers. Organization of the paper The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the projection game, and analyze the players costs, profits, and optimal strategies in this game. In Section 3, we study the dynamic parimutuel market, and show that trade in a DPM is equivalent to a projection game. We establish a connection between the projection game and the MSR in Section 4. In Section 5, we illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze non-myopic, and potentially manipulative, actions. We present our conclusions, and suggestions for future work, in Section 6. 2. THE PROJECTION GAME In this section, we describe an abstract betting game, the projection game; in the following sections, we will argue that both the MSR and the DPM are strategically similar to the projection game. The projection game is conceptually simpler than MSR and DPM, and hence should prove easier to analyze. For clarity of exposition, here and in the rest of the paper we assume the space is two dimensional, i.e., there are only two possible events. Our results easily generalize to more than two dimensions. We also assume throughout that players are risk-neutral. Suppose there are two mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, A and B. (In other words, B is the same as not A.) There are n agents who may have information about the likelihood of A and B, and we (the designers) would like to aggregate their information. We invite them to play the game described below: At any point in the game, there is a current state described by a pair of parameters, (x, y), which we sometimes write in vector form as x. Intuitively, x corresponds to the 2 Here, we are referring only to manipulation of the information market for later gain from the market itself; we do not consider the possibility of traders having vested interests in the underlying events. 317 total holding of shares in A, and y corresponds to the holding of shares in B. In each move of the game, one player (say i) plays an arrow (or segment) from (x, y) to (x , y ). We use the notation [(x, y) → (x , y )] or [x, x ] to denote this move. The game starts at (0, 0), but the market maker makes the first move; without loss of generality, we can assume the move is to (1, 1). All subsequent moves are made by players, in an arbitrary (and potentially repeating) sequence. Each move has a cost associated with it, given by C[x, x ] = |x | − |x|, where | · | denotes the Euclidean norm, |x| = p x2 + y2. Note that none of the variables are constrained to be nonnegative, and hence, the cost of a move can be negative. The cost can be expressed in an alternative form, that is also useful. Suppose player i moves from (x, y) to (x , y ). We can write (x , y ) as (x + lex, y + ley), such that l ≥ 0 and |ex|2 + |ey|2 = 1. We call l the volume of the move, and (ex, ey) the direction of the move. At any point (ˆx, ˆy), there is an instantaneous price charged, defined as follows: c((ˆx, ˆy), (ex, ey)) = ˆxex + ˆyey |(ˆx, ˆy)| = ˆx · e |ˆx| . Note that the price depends only on the angle between the line joining the vector (ˆx, ˆy) and the segment [(x, y), (x , y )], and not the lengths. The total cost of the move is the price integrated over the segment [(x, y) → (x , y )], i.e., C[(x, y) → (x , y )] = Z l w=0 c((x+wex, y +wey), (ex, ey))dw We assume that the game terminates after a finite number of moves. At the end of the game, the true probability p of event A is determined, and the agents receive payoffs for the moves they made. Let q = (qx, qy) = (p,1−p) |(p,1−p)| . The payoff to agent i for a segment [(x, y) → (x , y )] is given by: P([(x, y) → (x , y )]) = qx(x − x) + qy(y − y) = q.(x − x) We call the line through the origin with slope (1 − p)/p = qy/qx the p-line. Note that the payoff, too, may be negative. One drawback of the definition of a projection game is that implementing the payoffs requires us to know the actual probability p. This is feasible if the probability can eventually be determined statistically, such as when predicting the relative frequency of different recurring events, or vote shares. It is also feasible for one-off events in which there is reason to believe that the true probability is either 0 or 1. For other one-off events, it cannot be implemented directly (unlike scoring rules, which can be implemented in expectation). However, we believe that even in these cases, the projection game can be useful as a conceptual and analytical tool. The moves, costs and payoffs have a natural geometric representation, which is shown in Figure 1 for three players with one move each. The players append directed line segments in turn, and the payoff player i finally receives for a move is the projection of her segment onto the line with slope (1 − p)/p. Her cost is the difference of distances of the endpoints of her move to the origin. 2.1 Strategicproperties oftheprojectiongame We begin our strategic analysis of the projection game by observing the following simple path-independence property. 1−p p 3s m ove 1s payoff M M m ove 1s move 2smove 3s payoff 2s payoff x y Figure 1: A projection game with three players Lemma 1. [Path-Independence] Suppose there is a sequence of moves leading from (x, y) to (x , y ). Then, the total cost of all the moves is equal to the cost of the single move [(x, y) → (x , y )], and the total payoff of all the moves is equal to the payoff of the single move [(x, y) → (x , y )]. Proof. The proof follows trivially from the definition of the costs and payoffs: If we consider a path from point x to point x , both the net change in the vector lengths and the net projection onto the p-line are completely determined by x and x . Although simple, path independence of profits is vitally important, because it implies (and is implied by) the absence of arbitrage in the market. In other words, there is no sequence of moves that start and end at the same point, but result in a positive profit. On the other hand, if there were two paths from (x, y) to (x , y ) with different profits, there would be a cyclic path with positive profit. For ease of reference, we summarize some more useful properties of the cost and payoff functions in the projection game. Lemma 2. 1. The instantaneous price for moving along a line through the origin is 1 or −1, when the move is away or toward the origin respectively. The instantaneous price along a circle centered at the origin is 0. 2. When x moves along a circle centered at the origin to point ¯x on the positive p-line, the corresponding payoff is P(x, ¯x) = |x| − x · q, and the cost is C[x, ¯x] = 0. 3. The two cost function formulations are equivalent: C[x, x ] = Z l w=0 cos(x + we, e)dw = |x |−|x| ∀x, x , where e is the unit vector giving the direction of move. In addition, when x moves along the positive p-line, the payoff is equal to the cost, P(x, x ) = |x | − |x|. Proof. 1. The instantaneous price is c(x, e) = x · e/|x| = cos(x, e), where e is the direction of movement, and the result follows. 2. Since ¯x is on the positive p-line, q·¯x = |¯x| = |x|, hence P(x, ¯x) = q · (¯x − x) = |x| − x · q; the cost is 0 from the definition. 318 3. From Part 1, the cost of moving from x to the origin is C[x, 0] = Z l w=0 cos(x + we, e)dw = Z l w=0 (−1)dw = −|x|, where l = |x|, e = x/|x|. By the path-independence property, C[x, x ] = C[x, 0] + C[0, x ] = |x | − |x|. Finally, a point on the positive p-line gets projected to itself, namely q · x = |x| so when the movement is along the positive p-line, P(x, x ) = q · (x − x) = |x | − |x| = C[x, x ]. We now consider the question of which moves are profitable in this game. The eventual profit of a move [x, x ], where x = x + l.(ex, ey), is profit[x, x ] = P[x, x ] − C[x, x ] = lq.e − C[x, x ] Differentiating with respect to l, we get d(profit) dl = q.e − c(x + le, e) = q.e − x + le |x + le| .e We observe that this is 0 if p(y + ley) = (1 − p)(x + lex), in other words, when the vectors q and (x + le) are exactly aligned. Further, we observe that the price is non-decreasing with increasing l. Thus, along the direction e, the profit is maximized at the point of intersection with the p-line. By Lemma 2, there is always a path from x to the positive p-line with 0 cost, which is given by an arc of the circle with center at the origin and radius |x|. Also, any movement along the p-line has 0 additional profit. Thus, for any point x, we can define the profit potential φ(x, p) by φ(x, p) = |x| − x · q. Note, the potential is positive for x off the positive p-line and zero for x on the line. Next we show that a move to a lower potential is always profitable. Lemma 3. The profit of a move [x, x ] is equal to the difference in potential φ(x, p) − φ(x , p). Proof. Denote z = |x|q and z = |x |q, i.e., these are the points of intersection of the positive p-line with the circles centered at the origin with radii |x| and |x | respectively. By the path-independence property and Lemma 2, the profit of move [x, x ] is profit(x, x ) = profit(x, z) + profit(z, z ) + profit(z , x ) = (|x| − x · q) + 0 + (x · q − |x |) = φ(x, p) − φ(x , p). Thus, the profit of the move is equal to the change in profit potential between the endpoints. This lemma offers another way of seeing that it is optimal to move to the point of lowest potential, namely to the p-line. p y 1−p x x x z z profit = |x|−x.q profit = x.q−|x| profit = 0 Figure 2: The profit of move [x, x ] is equal to the change in profit potential from x to x . 3. DYNAMIC PARIMUTUEL MARKETS The dynamic parimutuel market (DPM) was introduced by Pennock [10] as an information market structure that encourages informed traders to trade early, has guaranteed liquidity, and requires a bounded subsidy. This market structure was used in the Yahoo! Buzz market [8]. In this section, we show that the dynamic parimutuel market is also remarkably similar to the projection game. Coupled with section 4, this also demonstrates a strong connection between the DPM and MSR. In a two-event DPM, users can place bets on either event A or B at any time, by buying a share in the appropriate event. The price of a share is variable, determined by the total amount of money in the market and the number of shares currently outstanding. Further, existing shares can be sold at the current price. After it is determined which event really happens, the shares are liquidated for cash. In the total-money-redistributed variant of DPM, which is the variant used in the Yahoo! market, the total money is divided equally among the shares of the winning event; shares of the losing event are worthless. Note that the payoffs are undefined if the event has zero outstanding shares; the DPM rules should preclude this possibility. We use the following notation: Let x be the number of outstanding shares of A (totalled over all traders), and y be the number of outstanding shares in B. Let M denote the total money currently in the market. Let cA and cB denote the prices of shares in A and B respectively. The price of a share in the Yahoo! DPM is determined by the share-ratio principle: cA cB = x y (1) The form of the prices can be fully determined by stipulating that, for any given value of M, x, and y, there must be some probability pA such that, if a trader believes that pA is the probability that A will occur and the market will liquidate in the current state, she cannot expect to profit from either buying or selling either share. This gives us cA = pA hM x i cB = pB hM y i 319 Since pA + pB = 1, we have: xcA + ycB = M (2) Finally, combining Equations 1 and 2, we get cA = x M x2 + y2 cB = y M x2 + y2 Cost of a trade in the DPM Consider a trader who comes to a DPM in state (M, x, y), and buys or sells shares such that the eventual state is (M , x , y ). What is the net cost, M − M, of her move? Theorem 4. The cost of the move from (x, y) to (x , y ) is M − M = M0[ p x 2 + y 2 − p x2 + y2] for some constant M0. In other words, it is a constant multiple of the corresponding cost in the projection game. Proof. Consider the function G(x, y) = M0[ p x2 + y2]. The function G is differentiable for all x, y = 0, and its partial derivatives are: ∂G ∂x = M0[ x p x2 + y2 ] = x G(x, y) x2 + y2 ∂G ∂y = M0[ y p x2 + y2 ] = y G(x, y) x2 + y2 Now, compare these equations to the prices in the DPM, and observe that, as a trader buys or sells in the DPM, the instantaneous price is the derivative of the money. It follows that, if at any point of time the DPM is in a state (M, x, y) such that M = G(x, y), then, at all subsequent points of time, the state (M , x , y ) of the DPM will satisfy M = G(x , y ). Finally, note that we can pick the constant M0 such that the equation is satisfied for the initial state of the DPM, and hence, it will always be satisfied. One important consequence of Theorem 4 is that the dynamic parimutuel market is arbitrage-free (using Lemma 1). It is interesting to note that the original Yahoo! Buzz market used a different pricing rule, which did permit arbitrage; the price rule was changed to the share-ratio rule after traders started exploiting the arbitrage opportunities [8]. Another somewhat surprising consequence is that the numbers of outstanding shares x, y completely determines the total capitalization M of the DPM. Constraints in the DPM Although it might seem, based on the costs, that any move in the projection game has an equivalent move in the DPM, the DPM places some constraints on trades. Firstly, no trader is allowed to have a net negative holding in either share. This is important, because it ensures that the total holdings in each share are always positive. However, this is a boundary constraint, and does not impact the strategic choices for a player with a sufficiently large positive holding in each share. Thus, we can ignore this constraint from a first-order strategic analysis of the DPM. Secondly, for practical reasons a DPM will probably have a minimum unit of trade, but we assume here that arbitrarily small quantities can be traded. Payoffs in the DPM At some point, trading in the DPM ceases and shares are liquidated. We assume here that the true probability becomes known at liquidation time, and describe the payoffs in terms of the probability; however, if the probability is not revealed, only the event that actually occurs, these payoffs can be implemented in expectation. Suppose the DPM terminates in a state (M, x, y), and the true probability of event A is p. When the dynamic parimutuel market is liquidated, the shares are paid off in the following way: Each owner of a share of A receives pM x , and each owner of a share of B receives (1 − p)M y , for each share owned. The payoffs in the DPM, although given by a fairly simple form, are conceptually complex, because the payoff of a move depends on the subsequent moves before the market liquidates. Thus, a fully rational choice of move in the DPM for player i should take into account the actions of subsequent players, including player i himself. Here, we restrict the analysis to myopic, infinitesimal strategies: Given the market position is (M, x, y), in which direction should a player make an infinitesimal move in order to maximize her profit? We show that the infinitesimal payoffs and profits of a DPM with true probability p correspond strategically to the infinitesimal payoffs and profits of a projection game with odds p p/(1 − p), in the following sense: Lemma 5. Suppose player i is about to make a move in a dynamic parimutuel market in a state (M, x, y), and the true probability of event A is p. Then, assuming the market is liquidated after is move, • If x y < q p 1−p , player i profits by buying shares in A , or selling shares in B. • If x y > q p 1−p , player i profits by selling shares in A, or buying shares in B. Proof. Consider the cost and payoff of buying a small quantity Δx of shares in A. The cost is C[(x, y) → (x + Δx, y)] = Δx · x M x2+y2 , and the payoff is Δx · pM x . Thus, buying the shares is profitable iff Δx · x M x2 + y2 < Δx · p M x ⇔ x2 x2 + y2 < p ⇔ x2 + y2 x2 > 1 p ⇔ 1 + ( y x )2 > 1 p ⇔ y x > r 1 − p p ⇔ x y < r p 1 − p Thus, buying A is profitable if x y < q p 1−p , and selling A is profitable if x y > q p 1−p . The analysis for buying or selling B is similar, with p and (1 − p) interchanged. It follows from Lemma 5 that it is myopically profitable for players to move towards the line with slope q 1−p p . Note that there is a one-to-one mapping between 1−p p and q 1−p p 320 in their respective ranges, so this line is uniquely defined, and each such line also corresponds to a unique p. However, because the actual payoff of a move depends on the future moves, players must base their decisions on some belief about the final state of the market. In the light of Lemma 5, one natural, rational-expectation style assumption is that the final state (M, x∗ , y∗ ) will satisfy x∗ y∗ = q p 1−p . (In other words, one might assume that the traders beliefs will ultimately converge to the true probability p; knowing p, the traders will drive the market state to satisfy x y = q p 1−p .) This is very plausible in markets (such as the Yahoo! Buzz market) in which trading is permitted right until the market is liquidated, at which point there is no remaining uncertainty about the relevant frequencies. Under this assumption, we can prove an even tighter connection between payoffs in the DPM (where the true probability is p) and payoffs in the projection game, with odds q p 1−p : Theorem 6. Suppose that the DPM ultimately terminates in a state (M, X, Y ) satisfying X Y = q p 1−p . Assume without loss of generality that the constant M0 = 1, so M =√ X2 + Y 2. Then, the final payoff for any move [x → x ] made in the course of trading is (x − x) · ( √ p, √ 1 − p), i.e., it is the same as the payoff in the projection game with oddsq p 1−p . Proof. First, observe that X M = √ p and Y M = √ 1 − p. The final payoff is the liquidation value of (x − x) shares of A and (y − y) shares of B, which is PayoffDP M [x − x] = p M X (x − x) + (1 − p) M Y (y − y) = p 1 √ p (x − x) + (1 − p) 1 √ 1 − p (y − y) = √ p(x − x) + p 1 − p(y − y). Strategic Analysis for the DPM Theorems 4 and 6 give us a very strong equivalence between the projection game and the dynamic parimutuel market, under the assumption that the DPM converges to the optimal value for the true probability. A player playing in a DPM with true odds p/(1 − p), can imagine himself playing in the projection game with odds q p 1−p , because both the costs and the payoffs of any given move are identical. Using this equivalence, we can transfer all the strategic properties proven for the projection game directly to the analysis of the dynamic parimutuel market. One particularly interesting conclusion we can draw is as follows: In the absence of any constraint that disallows it, it is always profitable for an agent to move towards the origin, by selling shares in both A and B while maintaining the ratio x/y. In the DPM, this is limited by forbidding short sales, so players can never have negative holdings in either share. As a result, when their holding in one share (say A) is 0, they cant use the strategy of moving towards the origin. We can conclude that a rational player should never hold shares of both A and B simultaneously, regardless of her beliefs and the market position. This discussion leads us to consider a modified DPM, in which this strategic loophole is addressed directly: Instead of disallowing all short sales, we place a constraint that no agent ever reduce the total market capitalization M (or, alternatively, that any agents total investment in the market is always non-negative). We call this the nondecreasing market capitalization constraint for the DPM. This corresponds to a restriction that no move in the projection game reduces the radius. However, we can conclude from the preceding discussion that players have no incentive to ever increase the radius. Thus, the moves of the projection game would all lie on the quarter circle in the positive quadrant, with radius determined by the market makers move. In section 4, we show that the projection game on this quarter circle is strategically equivalent (at least myopically) to trade in a Market Scoring Rule. Thus, the DPM and MSR appear to be deeply connected to each other, like different interfaces to the same underlying game. 4. MARKET SCORING RULES The Market Scoring Rule (MSR) was introduced by Hanson [6]. It is based on the concept of a proper scoring rule, a technique which rewards forecasters to give their best prediction. Hansons innovation was to turn the scoring rules into instruments that can be traded, thereby providing traders who have new information an incentive to trade. One positive effect of this design is that a single trader would still have incentive to trade, which is equivalent to updating the scoring rule report to reflect her information, thereby eliminating the problem of thin markets and illiquidity. In this section, we show that, when the scoring rule used is the spherical scoring rule [4], there is a strong strategic equivalence between the projection game and the market scoring rule. Proper scoring rules are tools used to reward forecasters who predict the probability distribution of an event. We describe this in the simple setting of two exhaustive, mutually exclusive events A and B. In the simple setting of two exhaustive, mutually exclusive events A and B, proper scoring rules are defined as follows. Suppose the forecaster predicts that the probabilities of the events are r = (rA, rB), with rA + rB = 1. The scoring rule is specified by functions sA(rA, rB) and sB(rA, rB), which are applied as follows: If the event A occurs, the forecaster is paid sA(rA, rB), and if the event B occurs, the forecaster is paid sB(rA, rB). The key property that a proper scoring rule satisfies is that the expected payment is maximized when the report is identical to the true probability distribution. 4.1 Equivalence with Spherical Scoring Rule In this section, we focus on one specific scoring rule: the spherical scoring rule [4]. Definition 1. The spherical scoring rule [4] is defined by si(r) def = ri/||r||. For two events, this can be written as: sA(rA, rB) = rA p r2 A + r2 B ; sB(rA, rB) = rB p r2 A + r2 B The spherical scoring rule is known to be a proper scoring rule. The definition generalizes naturally to higher dimensions. We now demonstrate a close connection between the projection game restricted to a circular arc and a market scoring rule that uses the spherical scoring rule. At this point, it is 321 convenient to use vector notation. Let x = (x, y) denote a position in the projection game. We consider the projection game restricted to the circle |x| = 1. Restricted projection game Consider a move in this restricted projection game from x to x . Recall that q = ( p √ p2+(1−p)2 , 1−p √ p2+(1−p)2 ), where p is the true probability of the event. Then, the projection game profit of a move [x, x ] is q · [x − x] (noting that |x| = |x |). We can extend this to an arbitrary collection3 of (not necessarily contiguous) moves X = {[x1, x1], [x2, x2], · · · , [xl, xl]}. SEG-PROFITp(X ) = X [x,x ]∈X q · [x − x] = q · 2 4 X [x,x ]∈X [x − x] 3 5 Spherical scoring rule profit We now turn our attention to the MSR with the spherical scoring rule (SSR). Consider a player who changes the report from r to r . Then, if the true probability of A is p, her expected profit is SSR-PROFIT([r, r ]) = p(sA(r )−sA(r))+(1−p)(sB(r )−sB(r)) Now, let us represent the initial and final position in terms of circular coordinates. For r = (rA, rB), define the corresponding coordinates x = ( rA√ r2 A+r2 B , rB√ r2 A+r2 B ). Note that the coordinates satisfy |x| = 1, and thus correspond to valid coordinates for the restricted projection game. Now, let p denote the vector [p, 1 − p]. Then, expanding the spherical scoring functions sA, sB, the players profit for a move from r to r can be rewritten in terms of the corresponding coordinates x, x as: SSR-PROFIT([x, x ]) = p · (x − x) For any collection X of moves, the total payoff in the SSR market is given by: SSR-PROFITp(X ) = X [x,x ]∈X p · [x − x] = p · 2 4 X [x,x ]∈X [x − x] 3 5 Finally, we note that p and q are related by q = μpp, where μp = 1/ p p2 + (1 − p)2 is a scalar that depends only on p. This immediately gives us the following strong strategic equivalence for the restricted projection game and the SSR market: Theorem 7. Any collection of moves X yields a positive (negative) payoff in the restricted projection game iff X yields a positive (negative) payoff in the Spherical Scoring Rule market. Proof. As derived above, SEG-PROFITp(X ) = μpSSR-PROFITp(X ). For all p, 1 ≤ μp ≤ √ 2, (or more generally for an ndimensional probability vector p, 1 ≤ μp = 1 |p| ≤ √ n, by the arithmetic mean-root mean square inequality), and the result follows immediately. 3 We allow the collection to contain repeated moves, i.e., it is a multiset. Although theorem 7 is stated in terms of the sign of the payoff, it extends to relative payoffs of two collections of moves: Corollary 8. Consider any two collections of moves X , X . Then, X yields a greater payoff than X in the projection game iff X yields a greater payment than X in the SSR market. Proof. Every move [x, x ] has a corresponding inverse move [x , x]. In both the projection game and the SSR, the inverse move profit is simply the negative profit of the move (the moves are reversible). We can define a collection of moves X = X − X by adding the inverse of X to X . Note that SEG-PROFITp(X ) = SEG-PROFITp(X )−SEG-PROFITp(X ) and SSR-PROFITp(X ) = SSR-PROFITp(X )−SSR-PROFITp(X ); applying theorem 7 completes the proof. It follows that the ex post optimality of a move (or set of moves) is the same in both the projection game and the SSR market. On its own, this strong ex post equivalence is not completely satisfying, because in any non-trivial game there is uncertainty about the value of p, and the different scaling ratios for different p could lead to different ex ante optimal behavior. We can extend the correspondence to settings with uncertain p, as follows: Theorem 9. Consider the restricted projection game with some prior probability distribution F over possible values of p. Then, there is a probability distribution G with the same support as F, and a strictly positive constant c that depends only on F such that: • (i) For any collection X of moves, the expected profits are related by: EF (SEG-PROFIT(X )) = cEG(SSR-PROFIT(X )) • (ii) For any collection X , and any measurable information set I ⊆ [0, 1], the expected profits conditioned on knowing that p ∈ I satisfy EF (SEG-PROFIT(X )|p ∈ I) = cEG(SSR-PROFIT(X )|p ∈ I) The converse also holds: For any probability distribution G, there is a distribution F such that both these statements are true. Proof. For simplicity, assume that F has a density function f. (The result holds even for non-continuous distributions). Then, let c = R 1 0 μpf(p)dp. Define the density function g of distribution G by g(p) = μpf(p) c Now, for a collection of moves X , EF (SEG-PROFIT(X )) = Z SEG-PROFITp(X )f(p)dp = Z SSR-PROFITp(X )μpf(p)dp = Z SSR-PROFITp(X )cg(p)dp = cEG(SSR-PROFIT(X )) 322 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x y log scoring rule quadratic scoring rule Figure 3: Sample score curves for the log scoring rule si(r) = ai + b log ri and the quadratic scoring rule si(r) = ai + b(2ri − P k r2 k). To prove part (ii), we simply restrict the integral to values in I. The converse follows similarly by constructing F from G. Analysis of MSR strategies Theorem 9 provides the foundation for analysis of strategies in scoring rule markets. To the extent that strategies in these markets are independent of the specific scoring rule used, we can use the spherical scoring rule as the market instrument. Then, analysis of strategies in the projection game with a slightly distorted distribution over p can be used to understand the strategic properties of the original market situation. Implementation in expectation Another important consequence of Theorem 9 is that the restricted projection game can be implemented with a small distortion in the probability distribution over values of p, by using a Spherical Scoring Rule to implement the payoffs. This makes the projection game valuable as a design tool; for example, we can analyze new constraints and rules in the projection game, and then implement them via the SSR. Unfortunately, the result does not extend to unrestricted projection games, because the relative profit of moving along the circle versus changing radius is not preserved through this transformation. However, it is possible to extend the transformation to projection games in which the radius ri after the ith move is a fixed function of i (not necessarily constant), so that it is not within the strategic control of the player making the move; such games can also be strategically implemented via the spherical scoring rule (with distortion of priors). 4.2 Connection to other scoring rules In this section, we show a weaker similarity between the projection game and the MSR with other scoring rules. We prove an infinitesimal similarity between the restricted projection game and the MSR with log scoring rule; the result generalizes to all proper scoring rules that have a unique local and global maximum. A geometric visualization of some common scoring rules in two dimensions is depicted in Figure 3. The score curves in the figure are defined by {(s1(r), s2(r)) | r = (r, 1 − r), r ∈ [0, 1]}. Similarly to the projection game, define the profit potential of a probability r in MSR to be the change in profit for moving from r to the optimum p, φMSR(s(r), p) = profitMSR[s(r), s(p)]. We will show that the profit potentials in the two games have analogous roles for analyzing the optimal strategies, in particular both potential functions have a global minimum 0 at r = p. Theorem 10. Consider the projection game restricted to the non-negative unit circle where strategies x have the natural one-to-one correspondence to probability distributions r = (r, 1 − r) given by x = ( r |r| , 1−r |r| ). Trade in a log market scoring rule is strategically similar to trade in the projection game on the quarter-circle, in that d dr φ(s(r), p) < 0 for r < p d dr φ(s(r), p) > 0 for r > p, both for the projection game and MSR potentials φ(.). Proof. (sketch) The derivative of the MSR potential is d dr φ(s(r), p) = −p · d dr s(r) = − X i pisi(r). For the log scoring rule si(r) = ai + b log ri with b > 0, d dr φMSR(s(r), p) = −p · b r , − b 1 − r = −b p r − 1 − p 1 − r = b r − p r(1 − r) . Since r = (r, 1 − r) is a probability distribution, this expression is positive for r > p and negative for r < p as desired. Now, consider the projection game on the non-negative unit circle. The potential for any x = ( r |r| , 1−r |r| ) is given by φ(x(r), p) = |x| − q · x(r), It is easy to show that d dr φ(x(r), p) < 0 for r < p and the derivative is positive for r > p, so the potential function along the circle is decreasing and then increasing with r similarly to an energy function, with a global minimum at r = p, as desired. Theorem 10 establishes that the market log-scoring rule is strategically similar to the projection game played on a circle, in the sense that the optimal direction of movement at the current state is the same in both games. For example, if the current state is r < p, it is profitable to move to r+dr since the effective profit of that move is profit(r, r ) = φ(s(r), p) − φ(s(r + dr), p) > 0. Although stated for logscoring rules, the theorem holds for any scoring rules that induce a potential with a unique local and global minimum at p, such as the quadratic scoring rule and others. 5. USING THEPROJECTION-GAMEMODEL The chief advantages of the projection game are that it is analytically tractable, and also easy to visualize. In Section 3, we used the projection-game model of the DPM to prove the absence of arbitrage, and to infer strategic properties that might have been difficult to deduce otherwise. In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about more complex strategic settings. 323 5.1 Traders with inertia The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the market forms we have studied asserts that traders who disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to trade in the market. The expected gain may, however, be very small. A plausible model of real trader behavior might include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than some constant . We do not attempt to justify this model here; rather, we illustrate how the projection game may be used to analyze such situations, and shed some light on how to modify the trading rules to alleviate this problem. Consider the simple projection game restricted to a circular arc with unit radius; as we have seen, this corresponds closely to the spherical market scoring rule, and to the dynamic parimutuel market under a reasonable constraint. Now, suppose the market probability is p, and a trader believes the true probability is p . Then, his expected gain can be calculated, as follows: Let q and q be the unit vectors in the directions of p and p respectively. The expected profit is given by E = φ(q, p ) = 1− q ·q . Thus, the trader will trade only if 1−q·q > . If we let θ and θ be the angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis), we get E = 1 − cos(θ − θ ); when θ is close to θ , a Taylor series approximation gives us that E ≈ (θ − θ )2 /2. Thus, we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy: The market price will not change as long as (θ − θ )2 ≤ 2 . Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market. One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant. This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy. However, it will also increase the market-makers exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this. The projection game model suggests a natural approach to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds on the market makers loss. The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move. Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1. Then, the traders expected profit would be E = r(1 − cos(θ − θ )). Using the same approximation as above, the trader would trade as long as (θ − θ )2 > 2 /r. Now, even if the market maker seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase with every trade. 5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not consider the impact of their trades on other traders beliefs. In practice, an informed trader can potentially profit by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders, in a way that allows her to profit later. In this section, we illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze an instance of this phenomenon, and to design market rules that mitigate this effect. The scenario we consider is as follows. There are two traders speculating on the probability of an event E, who each get a 1-bit signal. The optimal probability for each 2bit signal pair is as follows. If trader 1 gets the signal 0, and trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal probability is 0.3. If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is 0.9. If trader 1 gets 1, and trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal probability is 0.7. If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is 0.1. (Note that the impact of trader 2s signal is in a different direction, depending on trader 1s signal). Suppose that the prior distribution of the signals is that trader 1 is equally likely to get a 0 or a 1, but trader 2 gets a 0 with probability 0.55 and a 1 with probability 0.45. The traders are playing the projection game restricted to a circular arc. This setup is depicted in Figure 4. A B D C X Y Signals Opt. Pt 00 C D11 10 01 Event does not happenEventhappens B A Figure 4: Example illustrating non-myopic deception Suppose that, for some exogenous reason, trader 1 has the opportunity to trade, followed by trader 2. Then, trader 1 has the option of placing a last-minute trade just before the market closes. If traders were playing their myopically optimal strategies, here is how the market should run: If trader 1 sees a 0, he would move to some point Y that is between A and C, but closer to C. Trader 2 would then infer that trader 1 received a 0 signal and move to A or C if she got 1 or 0 respectively. Trader 1 has no reason to move again. If trader 1 had got a 1, he would move to a different point X instead, and trader 2 would move to D if she saw 1 and B if she saw 0. Again, trader 1 would not want to move again. Using the projection game, it is easy to show that, if traders consider non-myopic strategies, this set of strategies is not an equilibrium. The exact position of the points does not matter; all we need is the relative position, and the observation that, because of the perfect symmetry in the setup, segments XY, BC, and AD are all parallel to each other. Now, suppose trader 1 got a 0. He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1. Then, when trader 2 moved to, say, D, trader 1 could correct the rating to A. To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to playing two additional moves over trader 1s myopic strategy of moving to Y . The first move, Y X may either move toward or away from the optimal final position. The second move, DA or BC, is always in the correct direction. Further, because DA and BC are longer than XY , and parallel to XY , their projection on the final p-line will always be greater 324 in absolute value than the projection of XY , regardless of what the true p-line is! Thus, the deception would result in a strictly higher expected profit for trader 1. Note that this problem is not specific to the projection game form: Our equivalence results show that it could arise in the MSR or DPM (perhaps with a different prior distribution and different numerical values). Observe also that a strategy profile in which neither trader moved in the first two rounds, and trader 1 moved to either X or Y would be a subgame-perfect equilibrium in this setup. We suggest that one approach to mitigating this problem might be by reducing the radius at every move. This essentially provides a form of discounting that motivates trader 1 to take his profit early rather than mislead trader 2. Graphically, the right reduction factor would make the segments AD and BC shorter than XY (as they are chords on a smaller circle), thus making the myopic strategy optimal. 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented a simple geometric game, the projection game, that can serve as a model for strategic behavior in information markets, as well as a tool to guide the design of new information markets. We have used this model to analyze the cost, profit, and strategies of a trader in a dynamic parimutuel market, and shown that both the dynamic parimutuel market and the spherical market scoring rule are strategically equivalent to the restricted projection game under slight distortion of the prior probabilities. The general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit. In section 5, however, we analyze a small example market without this assumption. We demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties. Our results raise several very interesting open questions. Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed. It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game. Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market. Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest. The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area. A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.

Los mercados de introducción se han utilizado durante mucho tiempo como medio para el comercio. Como efecto secundario del comercio, los participantes en un mercado revelan algo sobre sus preferencias y creencias. Por ejemplo, en un mercado financiero, los agentes comprarían acciones que creen que están infravaloradas y venderían acciones que creen que están sobrevaloradas. Durante mucho tiempo se ha observado que, debido a que el precio del mercado está influenciado por todas las operaciones que tienen lugar, agrega la información privada de todos los comerciantes. Por lo tanto, en una situación en la que los eventos futuros son inciertos, y cada comerciante puede tener un poco de información, la información agregada contenida en los precios del mercado puede usarse para predecir eventos futuros. Esto ha motivado la creación de mercados de la información, que son mecanismos para agregar la información de los comerciantes sobre un evento incierto. Los mercados de la información pueden modelarse como un juego en el que los participantes apuestan a una serie de resultados posibles, como los resultados de una elección presidencial, comprando acciones de los resultados y recibiendo pagos cuando se realiza el resultado. Como en los mercados financieros, los participantes tienen como objetivo maximizar sus ganancias comprando bajo y vendiendo altos. De esta manera, el comportamiento de los jugadores transmite su información y creencias personales sobre los posibles resultados, y puede usarse para predecir el evento con mayor precisión. El beneficio de los mercados de información bien diseñados va más allá de la agregación de información;También se pueden usar como instrumento de cobertura, para permitir que los comerciantes aseguren el riesgo. Recientemente, los investigadores han recurrido al problema de diseñar estructuras de mercado específicamente para lograr mejores propiedades de agregación de información que los mercados tradicionales. Se han propuesto dos diseños para los mercados de información: el mercado dinámico parimutuel (DPM) por Pennock [10] y las reglas de puntuación del mercado (MSR) por Hanson [6]. Tanto el DPM como el MSR fueron diseñados con el objetivo de dar a los comerciantes informados un incentivo para el comercio y revelar su información lo antes posible, al tiempo que controlan el subsidio que el diseñador del mercado necesita bombear al mercado. El DPM se creó como una combinación de un mercado de pari-mutuel (que se usa comúnmente para apostar en caballos) y una doble subasta continua, para obtener simultáneamente los primeros primeros liquidez de compra infinita y la capacidad de los últimos para reaccionar continuamente anueva información. Se implementó una versión del DPM en el Yahoo! Buzz Market [8] para probar experimentalmente las propiedades de predicción de los mercados. Los fundamentos del MSR se encuentran en la idea de una regla de puntuación adecuada, que es una técnica para recompensar a los pronosticadores de una manera que los alienta a dar su mejor predicción.316 La innovación en el MSR es utilizar estas reglas de puntuación como instrumentos que se pueden negociar, lo que brinda a los comerciantes que tienen una nueva información un incentivo para el comercio. El MSR debía usarse en un mercado de análisis de políticas en el Medio Oriente [15], que posteriormente se retiró. Los mercados de la información dependen de los comerciantes informados que cotizan por sus propias ganancias, por lo que es fundamental comprender las propiedades estratégicas de estos mercados. Esta no es una tarea fácil, porque los mercados son complejos, y los comerciantes pueden influir en las creencias de los demás a través de sus oficios y, por lo tanto, pueden lograr ganancias a largo plazo manipulando el mercado. Para el MSR, se ha demostrado que, si excluyimos la posibilidad de lograr ganancias a través de otros comerciantes engañosos, es óptimo que cada comerciante refleje honestamente su creencia privada en sus oficios. Para el DPM, no conocemos ningún análisis estratégico previo de esta naturaleza;De hecho, se descubrió un agujero estratégico mientras probaba el DPM en el Yahoo! Buzz Market [8].1.1 Nuestros resultados en este documento, buscamos desarrollar un método analítico para guiar el diseño y el análisis estratégico de los mercados de la información. Nuestra contribución central es un nuevo juego de apuestas abstractas, el juego de proyección 1, que sirve como un modelo útil para los mercados de información. El juego de proyección es conceptualmente más simple que el MSR y el DPM, y por lo tanto es más fácil de analizar. Además, tiene una visualización geométrica atractiva, lo que hace que los movimientos estratégicos e interacciones sean más transparentes. Presentamos un análisis de las estrategias y ganancias óptimas en este juego. Luego realizamos un análisis de los costos y ganancias de los comerciantes en el mercado dinámico de parimutuel. Sorprendentemente, encontramos que el costo de una secuencia de operaciones en el DPM es idéntico al costo de los movimientos correspondientes en el juego de proyección. Además, si suponemos que las creencias de los comerciantes al final de la negociación coinciden con la verdadera probabilidad de que se predice el evento, los pagos y ganancias de los comerciantes en el DPM son idénticos a sus pagos y ganancias en un juego de proyección correspondiente. Utilizamos la equivalencia entre el DPM y el juego de proyección para demostrar que el DPM no contiene arbitraje, deduce estrategias rentables en el DPM y demostramos que las restricciones en los oficios de los agentes son necesarias para evitar un desglose estratégico. También demostramos una equivalencia entre el juego de proyección y el MSR: mostramos que el juego en el MSR es estratégicamente equivalente a jugar en un juego de proyección restringido, al menos para estrategias miopes y pequeños oficios. En particular, la rentabilidad de cualquier movimiento bajo la regla de puntuación esférica es exactamente proporcional a la rentabilidad del movimiento correspondiente en el juego de proyección restringido a un círculo, con una ligera distorsión de las probabilidades anteriores. Esto nos permite usar el juego de proyección como modelo conceptual para las reglas de puntuación del mercado. Observamos que si bien el MSR con la regla de puntuación esférica se asemeja un poco al juego de proyección, debido a la similitud matemática de sus expresiones de ganancias, el modelo DPM es notablemente diferente y, por lo tanto, su equivalencia al juego de proyección es especialmente sorprendente. Además, debido a que el juego de proyección restringido corresponde a un DPM con una restricción comercial natural, esto arroja luz sobre una conexión intrigante entre el MSR y el DPM.1 En una versión anterior de este documento, llamamos a este el juego de segmento. Por último, ilustramos cómo el modelo de juego de proyección puede usarse para analizar el potencial de manipulación de los mercados de información para una ganancia a largo plazo.2 Presentamos un escenario de ejemplo en el que puede ocurrir dicha manipulación y sugerir reglas adicionales que podrían mitigar la posibilidad de la posibilidad de quemanipulación. También ilustramos otra aplicación para analizar cómo un fabricante de mercado puede mejorar la precisión de la predicción de un mercado en el que los comerciantes no comerciarán a menos que su ganancia esperada esté por encima de un umbral.1.2 Trabajo relacionado numerosos estudios han demostrado empíricamente que los precios del mercado son buenos predictores de eventos futuros, y parecen agregar la sabiduría recolectada de todos los comerciantes [2, 3, 12, 1, 5, 16]. Este efecto también se ha demostrado en estudios de laboratorio [13, 14], y tiene apoyo teórico en la literatura de expectativas racionales [9]. Varios estudios recientes han abordado el diseño de la estructura del mercado y las reglas comerciales para los mercados de la información, así como el incentivo para participar y otros problemas estratégicos. Los dos documentos más estrechamente relacionados con nuestro trabajo son los documentos de Hanson [6] y Pennock [10]. Sin embargo, los problemas estratégicos en los mercados de la información también han sido estudiados por Mangold et al.[8] y por Hanson, Oprea y Porter [7]. Un próximo documento de encuesta [11] analiza las formulaciones de funciones de costo de los fabricantes de mercado automatizados. Organización del documento El resto de este documento se organiza de la siguiente manera: en la Sección 2, describimos el juego de proyección y analizamos los costos de los jugadores, las ganancias y las estrategias óptimas en este juego. En la Sección 3, estudiamos el mercado dinámico de parimutuel y mostramos que el comercio en un DPM es equivalente a un juego de proyección. Establecemos una conexión entre el juego de proyección y el MSR en la Sección 4. En la Sección 5, ilustramos cómo el juego de proyección puede usarse para analizar acciones no miopic y potencialmente manipulativas. Presentamos nuestras conclusiones y sugerencias para el trabajo futuro, en la Sección 6. 2. El juego de proyección En esta sección, describimos un juego de apuestas abstractas, el juego de proyección;En las siguientes secciones, argumentaremos que tanto el MSR como el DPM son estratégicamente similares al juego de proyección. El juego de proyección es conceptualmente más simple que MSR y DPM, y por lo tanto debería ser más fácil de analizar. Para mayor claridad de exposición, aquí y en el resto del artículo suponemos que el espacio es bidimensional, es decir, solo hay dos eventos posibles. Nuestros resultados se generalizan fácilmente a más de dos dimensiones. También asumimos que los jugadores son neutrales en el riesgo. Supongamos que hay dos eventos mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, A y B. (en otras palabras, B es lo mismo que no A) Hay N agentes que pueden tener información sobre la probabilidad de A y B, y nosotros (los diseñadores) nos gustaría agregar su información. Los invitamos a jugar el juego descrito a continuación: en cualquier momento del juego, hay un estado actual descrito por un par de parámetros, (x, y), que a veces escribimos en forma vectorial como x. Intuitivamente, X corresponde a los 2 aquí, nos referimos solo a la manipulación del mercado de la información para obtener ganancias posteriores del mercado en sí;No consideramos la posibilidad de que los comerciantes tengan intereses adquiridos en los eventos subyacentes.317 participación total de acciones en A, e Y corresponde a la tenencia de acciones en B. En cada movimiento del juego, un jugador (digamos I) juega una flecha (o segmento) de (x, y) a (x, y). Usamos la notación [(x, y) → (x, y)] o [x, x] para denotar este movimiento. El juego comienza en (0, 0), pero el fabricante de mercado hace el primer movimiento;Sin pérdida de generalidad, podemos suponer que el movimiento es (1, 1). Todos los movimientos posteriores son realizados por jugadores, en una secuencia arbitraria (y potencialmente repetida). Cada movimiento tiene un costo asociado con él, dado por C [x, x] = | x |- | x |, donde |· |denota la norma euclidiana, | x |= P x2 + y2. Tenga en cuenta que ninguna de las variables está limitada a no ser negativa y, por lo tanto, el costo de un movimiento puede ser negativo. El costo se puede expresar en una forma alternativa, que también es útil. Supongamos que el jugador I se mueve de (x, y) a (x, y). Podemos escribir (x, y) como (x + lex, y + ley), de modo que l ≥ 0 y | ex | 2 + | ey | 2 = 1. Llamamos a L el volumen del movimiento y (ex, ey) la dirección del movimiento. En cualquier punto (ˆx, ˆy), hay un precio instantáneo cargado, definido de la siguiente manera: c ((ˆx, ˆy), (ex, ey)) = ˆxex + ˆyey | (ˆx, ˆy) |= ˆX · e | ˆx |. Tenga en cuenta que el precio depende solo del ángulo entre la línea que une el vector (ˆx, ˆy) y el segmento [(x, y), (x, y)], y no las longitudes. El costo total del movimiento es el precio integrado en el segmento [(x, y) → (x, y)], es decir, c [(x, y) → (x, y)] = z l w = 0 c ((x +wex, y +wey), (ex, ey)) dw asumimos que el juego termina después de un número finito de movimientos. Al final del juego, se determina la verdadera probabilidad P del evento A, y los agentes reciben pagos por los movimientos que hicieron. Sea Q = (Qx, Qy) = (P, 1 - P) | (P, 1 - P) |. La recompensa al agente I para un segmento [(x, y) → (x, y)] viene dada por: P ([(x, y) → (x, y)]) = qx (x - x) + qy(y - y) = q.(x-x) Llamamos a la línea a través del origen con la pendiente (1-p)/p = qy/qx la línea p. Tenga en cuenta que la recompensa también puede ser negativa. Un inconveniente de la definición de un juego de proyección es que la implementación de los pagos requiere que sepamos la probabilidad real p.Esto es factible si la probabilidad se puede determinar estadísticamente, como al predecir la frecuencia relativa de diferentes eventos recurrentes o acciones de votación. También es factible para eventos únicos en los que hay razones para creer que la verdadera probabilidad es 0 o 1. Para otros eventos únicos, no se puede implementar directamente (a diferencia de las reglas de puntuación, que se pueden implementar con expectativa). Sin embargo, creemos que incluso en estos casos, el juego de proyección puede ser útil como una herramienta conceptual y analítica. Los movimientos, costos y pagos tienen una representación geométrica natural, que se muestra en la Figura 1 para tres jugadores con un movimiento cada uno. Los jugadores agregan segmentos de línea dirigidos a su vez, y el jugador de pago que finalmente recibe para un movimiento es la proyección de su segmento en la línea con pendiente (1 - p)/p. Su costo es la diferencia de distancias de los puntos finales de su movimiento al origen.2.1 StrategicProperties of theproycryegygame Comenzamos nuestro análisis estratégico del juego de proyección observando la siguiente propiedad simple de independencia de ruta.1-P P 3S M ove 1S PAGO M M M OVE 1S Move 2SMOve 3S PAGO DE PAGO 2S PAGO X Y Figura 1: Un juego de proyección con tres jugadores Lema 1. [Independencia de la ruta] Suponga que hay una secuencia de movimientos que conducen desde (x, y)a (x, y). Entonces, el costo total de todos los movimientos es igual al costo del movimiento único [(x, y) → (x, y)], y el pago total de todos los movimientos es igual a la recompensa del movimiento único [(x, y) → (x, y)]. Prueba. La prueba sigue de manera trivial desde la definición de los costos y los pagos: si consideramos una ruta del punto X al punto X, tanto el cambio neto en las longitudes del vector como la proyección neta en la línea P están completamente determinadas por X y X. Aunque simple, la independencia de la ruta de las ganancias es de vital importancia, ya que implica (y está implícita en) la ausencia de arbitraje en el mercado. En otras palabras, no hay una secuencia de movimientos que comienzan y terminan en el mismo punto, pero resultan en una ganancia positiva. Por otro lado, si hubiera dos caminos de (x, y) a (x, y) con diferentes ganancias, habría un camino cíclico con ganancias positivas. Para facilitar la referencia, resumimos algunas propiedades más útiles de las funciones de costo y pago en el juego de proyección. Lema 2. 1. El precio instantáneo para moverse a lo largo de una línea a través del origen es 1 o -1, cuando el movimiento está fuera o hacia el origen respectivamente. El precio instantáneo a lo largo de un círculo centrado en el origen es 0. 2. Cuando X se mueve a lo largo de un círculo centrado en el origen para el punto ¯x en la línea P positiva, el pago correspondiente es p (x, ¯x) = | x |- x · q, y el costo es c [x, ¯x] = 0. 3. Las dos formulaciones de función de costo son equivalentes: c [x, x] = z l w = 0 cos (x + we, e) dw = | x | - | x |∀x, x, donde E es el vector unitario que da la dirección de movimiento. Además, cuando X se mueve a lo largo de la línea P positiva, el pago es igual al costo, p (x, x) = | x |- | x |. Prueba.1. El precio instantáneo es c (x, e) = x · e/| x |= cos (x, e), donde e es la dirección del movimiento, y el resultado sigue.2. Dado que ¯x está en la línea P positiva, q · ¯x = | ¯x |= | x |, de ahí p (x, ¯x) = q · (¯x - x) = | x |- x · q;El costo es 0 de la definición.318 3. De la Parte 1, el costo de moverse de x al origen es c [x, 0] = z l w = 0 cos (x + we, e) dw = z l w = 0 (−1) dw = - | x |,donde l = | x |, e = x/| x |. Por la propiedad de independencia de ruta, c [x, x] = c [x, 0] + c [0, x] = | x |- | x |. Finalmente, se proyecta un punto en la línea P positiva, a saber, q · x = | x |Entonces, cuando el movimiento está a lo largo de la línea P positiva, p (x, x) = q · (x-x) = | x |- | x |= C [x, x]. Ahora consideramos la pregunta de qué movimientos son rentables en este juego. El beneficio eventual de un movimiento [x, x], donde x = x + l. (Ex, ey), es ganancias [x, x] = p [x, x] - c [x, x] = lq.e− C [x, x] diferenciando con respecto a L, obtenemos d (ganancias) dl = q.e - c (x + le, e) = q.e - x + le | x + le |.e observamos que esto es 0 si p (y + ley) = (1 - p) (x + lex), en otras palabras, cuando los vectores q y (x + le) están exactamente alineados. Además, observamos que el precio no se puede reducir al aumentar la L.Por lo tanto, a lo largo de la dirección E, el beneficio se maximiza en el punto de intersección con la línea P. Por Lemma 2, siempre hay una ruta de x a la línea P positiva con 0 costo, que está dado por un arco del círculo con centro en el origen y el radio | x |. Además, cualquier movimiento a lo largo de la línea P tiene 0 ganancias adicionales. Por lo tanto, para cualquier punto x, podemos definir el potencial de ganancias φ (x, p) por φ (x, p) = | x |- x · q. Tenga en cuenta que el potencial es positivo para X OFF la línea P positiva y cero para X en la línea. A continuación, mostramos que un movimiento a un potencial más bajo siempre es rentable. Lema 3. El beneficio de un movimiento [x, x] es igual a la diferencia en el potencial φ (x, p) - φ (x, p). Prueba. Denota z = | x | q y z = | x | q, es decir, estos son los puntos de intersección de la línea p positiva con los círculos centrados en el origen con radios | x |y | x |respectivamente. Por la propiedad de la independencia de la ruta y el Lemma 2, el beneficio del movimiento [x, x] es ganancias (x, x) = beneficio (x, z) + beneficio (z, z) + beneficio (z, x) = (|x | - x · q) + 0 + (x · q - | x |) = φ (x, p) - φ (x, p). Por lo tanto, el beneficio de la medida es igual al cambio en el potencial de ganancias entre los puntos finales. Este lema ofrece otra forma de ver que es óptimo moverse al punto de menor potencial, a saber, a la línea P.p y 1 - p x x x z z beneficio = | x | −x.q beneficio = x.q− | x |Beneficio = 0 Figura 2: La ganancia del movimiento [x, x] es igual al cambio de potencial de ganancias de x a x.3. Pennock [10] introdujo el mercado de parimutuel dinámico El mercado dinámico parimutuel (DPM) como una estructura del mercado de la información que alienta a los comerciantes informados a comerciar temprano, tiene liquidez garantizada y requiere un subsidio limitado. Esta estructura de mercado se utilizó en Yahoo! Buzz Market [8]. En esta sección, mostramos que el mercado dinámico Parimutuel también es notablemente similar al juego de proyección. Junto con la Sección 4, esto también demuestra una fuerte conexión entre el DPM y el MSR. En un DPM de dos eventos, los usuarios pueden hacer apuestas en cualquier evento A o B en cualquier momento, comprando una acción en el evento apropiado. El precio de una acción es variable, determinado por la cantidad total de dinero en el mercado y el número de acciones actualmente en circulación. Además, las acciones existentes se pueden vender al precio actual. Después de determinar qué evento realmente sucede, las acciones se liquidan por efectivo. En la variante redistribuida de dinero total de DPM, que es la variante utilizada en el Yahoo!Mercado, el dinero total se divide por igual entre las acciones del evento ganador;Las acciones del evento perdedor no tienen valor. Tenga en cuenta que los pagos están indefinidos si el evento tiene cero acciones en circulación;Las reglas de DPM deberían impedir esta posibilidad. Utilizamos la siguiente notación: Sea X el número de acciones en circulación de A (totalizadas sobre todos los comerciantes), y y serán el número de acciones en circulación en B. Deje que M denote el dinero total actualmente en el mercado. Deje que CA y CB denoten los precios de las acciones en A y B respectivamente. El precio de una acción en el Yahoo! DPM está determinado por el principio de relación de acciones: Ca Cb = x y (1) La forma de los precios puede determinarse completamente estipulando que, para cualquier valor dado de M, X e Y, debe haber alguna probabilidad PA de tal manera que, si un comerciante cree que la AP es la probabilidad de que A ocurra A y que el mercado liquidará en el estado actual, no puede esperar beneficiar a la compra o la venta de cualquiera de las acciones. Esto nos da ca = pa hm x i cb = pb hm y i 319 Desde pa + pb = 1, tenemos: xca + ycb = m (2) Finalmente, combinando las ecuaciones 1 y 2, obtenemos ca = x m x2 + y2 cb= Y M X2 + Y2 Costo de un comercio en el DPM Considere un comerciante que llega a un DPM en el estado (M, X, Y), y compra o vende acciones de tal manera que el estado eventual sea (M, X, Y). ¿Cuál es el costo neto, m - m, de su movimiento? Teorema 4. El costo del movimiento de (x, y) a (x, y) es m - m = m0 [p x 2 + y 2 - p x2 + y2] para alguna constante m0. En otras palabras, es un múltiplo constante del costo correspondiente en el juego de proyección. Prueba. Considere la función g (x, y) = m0 [p x2 + y2]. La función g es diferenciable para todos x, y = 0, y sus derivados parciales son: ∂g ∂x = m0 [x p x2 + y2] = x g (x, y) x2 + y2 ∂g ∂y = m0 [y px2 + y2] = y g (x, y) x2 + y2 Ahora, compare estas ecuaciones con los precios en el DPM y observe que, como un comerciante compra o vende en el DPM, el precio instantáneo es el derivado del dinero. Se deduce que, si en algún momento el DPM está en un estado (m, x, y) de modo que m = g (x, y), entonces, en todos los puntos de tiempo posteriores, el estado (m, x,y) del DPM satisfará m = g (x, y). Finalmente, tenga en cuenta que podemos elegir el M0 constante de tal manera que la ecuación esté satisfecha para el estado inicial del DPM y, por lo tanto, siempre se satisfará. Una consecuencia importante del Teorema 4 es que el mercado dinámico de parimutuel sin arbitraje (usando el Lema 1). Es interesante notar que el yahoo! original Buzz Market utilizó una regla de precios diferente, que permitió el arbitraje;La regla de precios se cambió a la regla de la relación de acciones después de que los comerciantes comenzaron a explotar las oportunidades de arbitraje [8]. Otra consecuencia algo sorprendente es que el número de acciones en circulación X, y determina completamente la capitalización total M del DPM. Las restricciones en el DPM, aunque puede parecer, según los costos, que cualquier movimiento en el juego de proyección tiene un movimiento equivalente en el DPM, el DPM impone algunas limitaciones a los intercambios. En primer lugar, ningún comerciante puede tener una tenencia negativa neta en ninguna de las acciones. Esto es importante, porque asegura que las tenencias totales en cada acción siempre sean positivas. Sin embargo, esta es una restricción límite, y no afecta las elecciones estratégicas para un jugador con una tenencia positiva suficientemente grande en cada acción. Por lo tanto, podemos ignorar esta restricción de un análisis estratégico de primer orden del DPM. En segundo lugar, por razones prácticas, un DPM probablemente tendrá una unidad mínima de comercio, pero suponemos aquí que se pueden comercializar cantidades arbitrariamente pequeñas. Los pagos en el DPM en algún momento, cesan el DPM y se liquidan las acciones. Suponemos aquí que la verdadera probabilidad se conoce en el momento de la liquidación y describimos los pagos en términos de la probabilidad;Sin embargo, si no se revela la probabilidad, solo el evento que realmente ocurre, estos pagos se pueden implementar con expectativa. Supongamos que los DPM terminan en un estado (M, X, Y), y la verdadera probabilidad de Evento A es p.Cuando se liquide el mercado dinámico parimutuel, las acciones se pagan de la siguiente manera: cada propietario de una parte de A recibe PM X, y cada propietario de una parte de B recibe (1 - p) M y, por cada acción de propiedad. Los pagos en el DPM, aunque dados por una forma bastante simple, son conceptualmente complejos, porque el pago de un movimiento depende de los movimientos posteriores antes de que el mercado se liquide. Por lo tanto, una elección totalmente racional de movimiento en el DPM para el jugador debería tener en cuenta las acciones de los jugadores posteriores, incluido el jugador I mismo. Aquí, restringimos el análisis a las estrategias miope e infinitesimales: dada la posición del mercado (M, x, y), ¿en qué dirección debe un jugador hacer un movimiento infinitesimal para maximizar sus ganancias? Mostramos que los pagos infinitesimales y las ganancias de un DPM con verdadera probabilidad P corresponden estratégicamente a los pagos infinitesimales y las ganancias de un juego de proyección con probabilidades P P/(1 - P), en el siguiente sentido: Lema 5. Supongamos que el jugador I está a punto de hacer un movimiento en un mercado dinámico parimutuel en un estado (M, x, y), y la verdadera probabilidad de evento A es p.Luego, suponiendo que el mercado se liquide después de que se mude, • Si x y <q p 1 - P, el jugador I se beneficia comprando acciones en A o vendiendo acciones en B. • Si x y> q p 1 - P, el jugador I se beneficia vendiendo accionesen a, o comprar acciones en B. Prueba. Considere el costo y la recompensa de comprar una pequeña cantidad Δx de acciones en A. El costo es c [(x, y) → (x + Δx, y)] = Δx · x m x2 + y2, y el pago es Δx · pm x. Por lo tanto, comprar las acciones es rentable IFF ΔX · X M X2 + Y2 <ΔX · P M X ⇔ X2 X2 + Y2 <P ⇔ X2 + Y2 X2> 1 P ⇔ 1 + (Y X) 2> 1 P ⇔ Y X> R1 - p p ⇔ x y <r p 1 - p Por lo tanto, comprar A es rentable si x y <q p 1 - p, y vender A es rentable si x y> q p 1 - p. El análisis para comprar o vender B es similar, con P y (1 - P) intercambiado. De Lemma 5 se deduce que es miopicalmente rentable para los jugadores avanzar hacia la línea con la pendiente Q 1 - P p. Tenga en cuenta que hay un mapeo uno a uno entre 1-P P y Q 1-P P 320 en sus rangos respectivos, por lo que esta línea se define de manera única, y cada una de estas líneas también corresponde a una P única.Sin embargo, debido a que la recompensa real de un movimiento depende de los movimientos futuros, los jugadores deben basar sus decisiones en alguna creencia sobre el estado final del mercado. A la luz del Lema 5, una suposición de estilo de expectación natural y racional es que el estado final (m, x ∗, y ∗) satisfará x ∗ y ∗ = q p 1-p.(En otras palabras, se podría suponer que las creencias de los comerciantes en última instancia convergerán a la verdadera probabilidad P; sabiendo P, los comerciantes impulsarán al estado del mercado a satisfacer x y = q p 1 - p.) Esto es muy plausible en los mercados (como el Yahoo! Mercado de rumores) en el que se permite el comercio correctamente hasta que se liquide el mercado, momento en el cual no hay incertidumbre restante sobre las frecuencias relevantes. Bajo esta suposición, podemos probar una conexión aún más estrecha entre los pagos en el DPM (donde la verdadera probabilidad es P) y los pagos en el juego de proyección, con las probabilidades Q P 1 - P: Teorema 6. Suponga que el DPM finalmente termina en un estado (m, x, y) que satisface x y = q p 1 - p. Suponga sin pérdida de generalidad que la constante M0 = 1, entonces M = √ x2 + y 2. Luego, la recompensa final para cualquier movimiento [x → x] realizado en el curso del comercio es (x - x) · (√ p, √ 1 - p), es decir, es lo mismo que el recompensa en el juego de proyección conODDSQ P 1 - P. Prueba. Primero, observe que x m = √ p e y m = √ 1 - p.El pago final es el valor de liquidación de (x - x) acciones de A e (y - y) acciones de B, que es PayOffDP m [x - x] = P m x (x - x) + (1 - p) m y(y - y) = p 1 √ p (x - x) + (1 - p) 1 √ 1 - p (y - y) = √ p (x - x) + p 1 - p (y - y). El análisis estratégico para los teoremas de DPM 4 y 6 nos dan una equivalencia muy fuerte entre el juego de proyección y el mercado dinámico parimutuel, bajo el supuesto de que el DPM converge al valor óptimo para la verdadera probabilidad. Un jugador que juega en un DPM con verdaderas probabilidades P/(1 - P), puede imaginarse a sí mismo jugando en el juego de proyección con Odds Q P 1 - P, porque tanto los costos como los pagos de cualquier movimiento son idénticos. Usando esta equivalencia, podemos transferir todas las propiedades estratégicas probadas para el juego de proyección directamente al análisis del mercado dinámico parimutuel. Una conclusión particularmente interesante que podemos sacar es la siguiente: en ausencia de cualquier restricción que lo elimine, siempre es rentable que un agente avance hacia el origen, vendiendo acciones tanto en A como en B mientras mantiene la relación x/y. En el DPM, esto está limitado al prohibir las ventas cortas, por lo que los jugadores nunca pueden tener tenencias negativas en ninguna de las acciones. Como resultado, cuando su tenencia en una acción (digamos a) es 0, no pueden usar la estrategia de avanzar hacia el origen. Podemos concluir que un jugador racional nunca debe tener acciones de A y B simultáneamente, independientemente de sus creencias y la posición del mercado. Esta discusión nos lleva a considerar un DPM modificado, en el que este laguna estratégica se aborda directamente: en lugar de rechazar todas las ventas cortas, colocamos una restricción de que ningún agente reduzca la capitalización de mercado total (o, alternativamente, que cualquier agente total de inversiónen el mercado siempre no es negativo). Llamamos a esto la restricción de capitalización de mercado que no se puede crear para el DPM. Esto corresponde a una restricción de que ningún movimiento en el juego de proyección reduce el radio. Sin embargo, podemos concluir de la discusión anterior que los jugadores no tienen incentivos para aumentar el radio. Por lo tanto, los movimientos del juego de proyección se encuentran en el círculo de cuarto en el cuadrante positivo, con el radio determinado por el movimiento de los fabricantes del mercado. En la Sección 4, mostramos que el juego de proyección en este círculo de trimestre es estratégicamente equivalente (al menos miopicalmente) para comerciar en una regla de puntuación del mercado. Por lo tanto, el DPM y el MSR parecen estar profundamente conectados entre sí, como diferentes interfaces para el mismo juego subyacente.4. Reglas de puntuación del mercado La regla de puntuación del mercado (MSR) fue introducida por Hanson [6]. Se basa en el concepto de una regla de puntuación adecuada, una técnica que recompensa a los pronosticadores para dar su mejor predicción. Hansons Innovation debía convertir las reglas de puntuación en instrumentos que se pueden negociar, lo que proporciona a los comerciantes que tienen a los comerciantes que tienen una nueva información un incentivo para el comercio. Un efecto positivo de este diseño es que un solo comerciante aún tendría un incentivo para el comercio, lo cual es equivalente a actualizar el informe de la regla de puntuación para reflejar su información, eliminando así el problema de los mercados delgados y la iliquidez. En esta sección, mostramos que, cuando la regla de puntuación utilizada es la regla de puntuación esférica [4], existe una fuerte equivalencia estratégica entre el juego de proyección y la regla de puntuación del mercado. Las reglas de puntuación adecuadas son herramientas utilizadas para recompensar los pronosticadores que predicen la distribución de probabilidad de un evento. Describimos esto en la configuración simple de dos eventos exhaustivos y mutuamente excluyentes A y B. En la configuración simple de dos eventos exhaustivos y mutuamente excluyentes A y B, las reglas de puntuación adecuadas se definen de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el pronosticador predice que las probabilidades de los eventos son r = (ra, rb), con ra + rb = 1. La regla de puntuación se especifica mediante las funciones SA (RA, RB) y SB (RA, RB), que se aplican de la siguiente manera: si se produce el evento A, el pronosticador se paga SA (RA, RB), y si el evento B ocurre, el pronosticador se le paga SB (RA, RB). La propiedad clave que satisface una regla de puntuación adecuada es que el pago esperado se maximiza cuando el informe es idéntico a la distribución de probabilidad verdadera.4.1 Equivalencia con la regla de puntuación esférica En esta sección, nos centramos en una regla de puntuación específica: la regla de puntuación esférica [4]. Definición 1. La regla de puntuación esférica [4] se define por si (r) def = ri/|| r ||. Para dos eventos, esto se puede escribir como: sa (ra, rb) = ra p r2 a + r2 b;SB (RA, RB) = RB P R2 A + R2 B Se sabe que la regla de puntuación esférica es una regla de puntuación adecuada. La definición se generaliza naturalmente a las dimensiones superiores. Ahora demostramos una estrecha conexión entre el juego de proyección restringido a un arco circular y una regla de puntuación del mercado que utiliza la regla de puntuación esférica. En este punto, es 321 conveniente usar notación vectorial. Sea x = (x, y) denota una posición en el juego de proyección. Consideramos el juego de proyección restringido al círculo | x |= 1. Juego de proyección restringido Considere un movimiento en este juego de proyección restringido de X a X. Recuerde que Q = (P √ P2+(1 - P) 2, 1 - P √ P2+(1 - P) 2), donde P es la verdadera probabilidad del evento. Luego, la ganancia del juego de proyección de un movimiento [x, x] es q · [x - x] (señalando que | x | = | x |). Podemos extender esto a una colección arbitraria3 de (no necesariamente contiguo) se mueve x = {[x1, x1], [x2, x2], · · ·, [xl, xl]}. Seg-profitp (x) = x [x, x] ∈X q · [x-x] = q · 2 4 x [x, x] ∈X [x-x] 3 5 ganancia de regla de puntuación esférica ahora giramos nuestroAtención al MSR con la regla de puntuación esférica (SSR). Considere a un jugador que cambia el informe de R a R. Entonces, si la verdadera probabilidad de A es P, su beneficio esperado es SSR-Profit ([R, R]) = P (SA (R) −SA (R))+(1-P) (SB (R)-−SB (R)) Ahora, representamos la posición inicial y final en términos de coordenadas circulares. Para R = (RA, Rb), defina las coordenadas correspondientes x = (Ra√ R2 A+R2 B, RB√ R2 A+R2 B). Tenga en cuenta que las coordenadas satisfacen | x |= 1, y por lo tanto corresponde a coordenadas válidas para el juego de proyección restringido. Ahora, deje que P denote el vector [P, 1 - P]. Luego, expandiendo las funciones de puntuación esférica SA, SB, los jugadores se benefician para un movimiento de R a R se pueden reescribir en términos de las coordenadas correspondientes x, x como: SSR-Profit ([x, x]) = P · (x-x) Para cualquier colección X de movimientos, el pago total en el mercado de SSR viene dado por: SSR-Profitp (x) = x [x, x] ∈X P · [x-x] = p · 2 4 x [x, x] ∈X [x - x] 3 5 Finalmente, observamos que P y Q están relacionados con Q = μPP, donde μP = 1/ p p2 + (1 - p) 2 es un escalar que depende solo de P.Esto inmediatamente nos da la siguiente equivalencia estratégica fuerte para el juego de proyección restringido y el mercado de SSR: Teorema 7. Cualquier colección de movimientos x produce una recompensa positiva (negativa) en el juego de proyección restringido IFF X produce un pago positivo (negativo) en el mercado de reglas de puntuación esférica. Prueba. Como se derivó anteriormente, SEG-ProfitP (x) = μPSSR-ProfitP (x). Para todas las p, 1 ≤ μP ≤ √ 2, (o más generalmente para un vector de probabilidad ndimensional P, 1 ≤ μP = 1 | P | ≤ √ n, por la desigualdad cuadrada media de raíz media aritmética), y el resultado sigue inmediatamente.3 Permitimos que la colección contenga movimientos repetidos, es decir, es un Multiset. Aunque el Teorema 7 se establece en términos del signo de la recompensa, se extiende a los pagos relativos de dos colecciones de movimientos: Corolario 8. Considere dos colecciones de movimientos x, x. Luego, X produce una recompensa mayor que X en el juego de proyección IFF X produce un pago mayor que X en el mercado de SSR. Prueba. Cada movimiento [x, x] tiene un movimiento inverso correspondiente [x, x]. Tanto en el juego de proyección como en la SSR, el beneficio de movimiento inverso es simplemente la ganancia negativa del movimiento (los movimientos son reversibles). Podemos definir una colección de movimientos x = x - x agregando el inverso de x a x. Tenga en cuenta que SEG-ProfitP (x) = SEG-ProfitP (x) −seg-ProfitP (x) y SSR-ProfitP (x) = SSR-ProfitP (x) −SSR-ProfitP (x);La aplicación del Teorema 7 completa la prueba. Se deduce que la optimización ex post de un movimiento (o conjunto de movimientos) es la misma tanto en el juego de proyección como en el mercado de SSR. Por sí solo, esta fuerte equivalencia ex post no es completamente satisfactoria, porque en cualquier juego no trivial existe incertidumbre sobre el valor de P, y las diferentes relaciones de escala para diferentes P podrían conducir a un comportamiento óptimo de diferentes ex ante. Podemos extender la correspondencia a la configuración con P incierta, de la siguiente manera: Teorema 9. Considere el juego de proyección restringido con alguna distribución de probabilidad previa F sobre posibles valores de p.Luego, hay una distribución de probabilidad G con el mismo soporte que F, y una constante estrictamente positiva C que depende solo de F tal que: • (i) para cualquier colección X de movimientos, las ganancias esperadas están relacionadas con: EF (SEG-Profit (x)) = ceg (SSR-Profit (x)) • (ii) Para cualquier colección X, y cualquier conjunto de información medible I ⊆ [0, 1], las ganancias esperadas condicionadas a saber que p ∈ Satisface EF(SEG-Profit (x) | P ∈ I) = CEG (SSR-Profit (x) | P ∈ I) El Converse también se mantiene: para cualquier distribución de probabilidad G, hay una distribución F de modo que ambas declaraciones son verdaderas. Prueba. Para simplificar, suponga que F tiene una función de densidad f.(El resultado se mantiene incluso para distribuciones no continuas). Entonces, deje c = R 1 0 μPF (P) DP. Defina la función de densidad G de la distribución G por g (p) = μpf (p) c Now, para una colección de movimientos x, ef (seg-profit (x)) = z SEG-Profitp (x) f (p) DP= Z ssr-profitp (x) μPF (p) dp = z ssr-profitp (x) cg (p) dp = ceg (ssr-profit (x)) 322 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x Y Regla de puntuación de registro Regla de puntuación cuadrática Figura 3: Curvas de puntuación de muestra para la regla de puntuación de registro Si (R) = AI + B Log RI y la regla de puntuación cuadrática Si (R) = AI + B (2RI (2RI- P K R2 K). Para probar la parte (ii), simplemente restringimos la integral a los valores en I. El Converse sigue de manera similar construyendo F a partir de G. Análisis de las estrategias MSR Teorema 9 proporciona la base para el análisis de estrategias en los mercados de reglas de puntuación. En la medida en que las estrategias en estos mercados son independientes de la regla de puntuación específica utilizada, podemos usar la regla de puntuación esférica como instrumento de mercado. Luego, el análisis de estrategias en el juego de proyección con una distribución ligeramente distorsionada sobre P se puede utilizar para comprender las propiedades estratégicas de la situación del mercado original. Implementación En expectativa, otra consecuencia importante del Teorema 9 es que el juego de proyección restringido se puede implementar con una pequeña distorsión en la distribución de probabilidad sobre los valores de P, mediante el uso de una regla de puntuación esférica para implementar los pagos. Esto hace que el juego de proyección sea valioso como una herramienta de diseño;Por ejemplo, podemos analizar nuevas limitaciones y reglas en el juego de proyección, y luego implementarlas a través de la SSR. Desafortunadamente, el resultado no se extiende a juegos de proyección sin restricciones, porque la ganancia relativa de moverse a lo largo del círculo versus el radio cambiante no se conserva a través de esta transformación. Sin embargo, es posible extender la transformación a los juegos de proyección en los que el radio RI después del movimiento ésimo es una función fija de I (no necesariamente constante), por lo que no está dentro del control estratégico del jugador que hace el movimiento;Tales juegos también se pueden implementar estratégicamente a través de la regla de puntuación esférica (con distorsión de los antecedentes).4.2 Conexión a otras reglas de puntuación en esta sección, mostramos una similitud más débil entre el juego de proyección y el MSR con otras reglas de puntuación. Probamos una similitud infinitesimal entre el juego de proyección restringido y el MSR con la regla de puntuación de log;El resultado se generaliza a todas las reglas de puntuación adecuadas que tienen un máximo local y global único. En la Figura 3 se representa una visualización geométrica de algunas reglas de puntuación comunes en dos dimensiones. Las curvas de puntaje en la figura se definen por {(S1 (R), S2 (R)) |r = (r, 1 - r), r ∈ [0, 1]}. De manera similar al juego de proyección, defina el potencial de ganancias de una probabilidad R en MSR de ser el cambio en las ganancias para pasar de r a la p, φMsr (s (r), p) = ganancias [s (r), s (s (pag)]. Mostraremos que los potenciales de ganancias en los dos juegos tienen roles análogos para analizar las estrategias óptimas, en particular ambas funciones potenciales tienen un mínimo global 0 en r = p.Teorema 10. Considere el juego de proyección restringido al círculo unitario no negativo donde las estrategias x tienen la correspondencia natural uno a uno a las distribuciones de probabilidad r = (r, 1-r) dada por x = (r | r |, 1-R |r |). El comercio en una regla de puntuación del mercado de registros es estratégicamente similar al comercio en el juego de proyección en el cuarto de círculo, en ese D dr φ (s (r), p) <0 para r <p d dr φ (s (r), p)> 0 para r> p, tanto para el juego de proyección como para los potenciales MSR φ (.). Prueba.(boceto) El derivado del potencial MSR es D Dr φ (S (R), P) = −p · D Dr S (R) = - X I PISI (R). Para la regla de puntuación de registro Si (R) = Ai + B log Ri con B> 0, D DR φMSR (S (R), P) = −p · B R, - B 1 - R = −B P R - 1 - P 1- r = b r - p r (1 - r). Dado que r = (r, 1 - r) es una distribución de probabilidad, esta expresión es positiva para r> p y negativa para r <p como se desea. Ahora, considere el juego de proyección en el círculo de la unidad no negativa. El potencial para cualquier x = (r | r |, 1 - r | r |) es dado por φ (x (r), p) = | x |- q · x (r), es fácil demostrar que d dr φ (x (r), p) <0 para r <p y la derivada es positiva para r> p, por lo que la función potencial a lo largo del círculo está disminuyendoy luego aumentando con R de manera similar a una función de energía, con un mínimo global en R = P, como se desea. El Teorema 10 establece que la regla de puntuación del registro del mercado es estratégicamente similar al juego de proyección jugado en un círculo, en el sentido de que la dirección óptima del movimiento en el estado actual es la misma en ambos juegos. Por ejemplo, si el estado actual es R <P, es rentable moverse a R+Dr ya que el beneficio efectivo de ese movimiento es ganancias (r, r) = φ (s (r), p) - φ (s (s (s (s (r + dr), p)> 0. Aunque se afirma para las reglas de escorsión de registro, el teorema es válido para cualquier regla de puntuación que induce un potencial con un mínimo local y global único en P, como la regla de puntuación cuadrática y otras.5. Utilizando el Gamemodel de Profección, las principales ventajas del juego de proyección son que es analíticamente manejable y también es fácil de visualizar. En la Sección 3, utilizamos el modelo de juego de proyección del DPM para probar la ausencia de arbitraje e inferir propiedades estratégicas que podrían haber sido difíciles de deducir de otra manera. En esta sección, proporcionamos dos ejemplos que ilustran el poder del análisis del juego de proyección para obtener información sobre entornos estratégicos más complejos.323 5.1 Comerciantes Con inercia El análisis estándar del comportamiento del comerciante en cualquiera de los formularios de mercado hemos estudiado afirma que los comerciantes que no están de acuerdo con las probabilidades de mercado esperarán que ganen de cambiar la probabilidad y, por lo tanto, tienen un incentivo estricto para comerciar en el mercado. Sin embargo, la ganancia esperada puede ser muy pequeña. Un modelo plausible de comportamiento real del comerciante podría incluir alguna forma de inercia o óptima: suponemos que los comerciantes comerciarán si su ganancia esperada es mayor que alguna constante. No intentamos justificar este modelo aquí;Más bien, ilustramos cómo se puede usar el juego de proyección para analizar tales situaciones y arrojar algo de luz sobre cómo modificar las reglas comerciales para aliviar este problema. Considere el juego de proyección simple restringido a un arco circular con radio unitario;Como hemos visto, esto corresponde estrechamente a la regla de puntuación del mercado esférico y al mercado dinámico parimutuel bajo una restricción razonable. Ahora, supongamos que la probabilidad de mercado es P, y un comerciante cree que la verdadera probabilidad es p. Luego, se puede calcular su ganancia esperada, de la siguiente manera: Sea Q y Q los vectores unitarios en las direcciones de P y P respectivamente. La ganancia esperada viene dada por E = φ (Q, P) = 1− Q · Q. Por lo tanto, el comerciante comerciará solo si 1 - Q · Q>. Si dejamos que θ y θ sean los ángulos de la línea p y la línea p respectivamente (del eje x), obtenemos E = 1-cos (θ-θ);Cuando θ está cerca de θ, una aproximación de la serie Taylor nos da que E ≈ (θ - θ) 2/2. Por lo tanto, podemos derivar un límite en el límite de la precisión del mercado: el precio del mercado no cambiará siempre que (θ - θ) 2 ≤ 2. Ahora, suponga que un operador de mercado que enfrenta esta situación quería agudizar la precisión del mercado. Un enfoque natural es simplemente multiplicar todos los pagos por una constante. Esto corresponde al uso de un círculo más grande en el juego de proyección, y de hecho mejoraría la precisión. Sin embargo, también aumentará la exposición a la pérdida de los fabricantes de mercado: el fabricante de mercado tendría que bombear más dinero para lograr esto. El modelo de juego de proyección sugiere un enfoque natural para mejorar la precisión al tiempo que conserva los mismos límites de la pérdida de los fabricantes de mercado. La idea es que, en lugar de restringir todos los movimientos a estar en el círculo unitario, obligamos a cada movimiento a tener un radio ligeramente mayor que el movimiento anterior. Supongamos que insistimos en que, si el radio actual es R, el próximo comerciante tiene que moverse a R + 1. Entonces, el beneficio esperado de los operadores sería E = R (1 - cos (θ - θ)). Usando la misma aproximación que anteriormente, el comerciante se negociaría tan tiempo que (θ - θ) 2> 2 /r. Ahora, incluso si el fabricante de mercado sembró el mercado con R = 1, aumentaría con cada comercio y los incentivos para agudizar el aumento de la estimación con cada comercio.5.2 Análisis de estrategias a largo plazo Hasta este punto, nuestro análisis se ha restringido a estrategias de comerciantes que son miopes en el sentido de que los comerciantes no consideran el impacto de sus operaciones en las creencias de otros comerciantes. En la práctica, un comerciante informado puede beneficiarse potencialmente jugando una estrategia subóptima para engañar a otros comerciantes, de una manera que le permita beneficiarse más tarde. En esta sección, ilustramos cómo se puede utilizar el juego de proyección para analizar una instancia de este fenómeno y para diseñar reglas de mercado que mitigan este efecto. El escenario que consideramos es el siguiente. Hay dos operadores que especulan sobre la probabilidad de un evento E, cada uno de los cuales recibe una señal de 1 bits. La probabilidad óptima para cada par de señales de 2 bits es la siguiente. Si el comerciante 1 obtiene la señal 0, y el comerciante 2 obtiene la señal 0, la probabilidad óptima es 0.3. Si el comerciante 1 obtuvo un 0, pero el comerciante 2 obtuvo un 1, la probabilidad óptima es 0.9. Si el comerciante 1 obtiene 1, y el comerciante 2 obtiene la señal 0, la probabilidad óptima es 0.7. Si el comerciante 1 obtuvo un 0, pero el comerciante 2 obtuvo un 1, la probabilidad óptima es 0.1.(Tenga en cuenta que el impacto de la señal del comerciante 2S está en una dirección diferente, dependiendo de la señal del comerciante 1S). Suponga que la distribución previa de las señales es que el comerciante 1 es igualmente probable que obtenga un 0 o un 1, pero el comerciante 2 obtiene un 0 con probabilidad 0.55 y un 1 con probabilidad 0.45. Los comerciantes están jugando el juego de proyección restringido a un arco circular. Esta configuración se representa en la Figura 4. A B D C X Y Señales Opt. Pt 00 C D11 10 01 El evento no se hace dimensiones B A Figura 4: Ejemplo que ilustra el engaño no miopic supongo que, por alguna razón exógena, el comerciante 1 tiene la oportunidad de comerciar, seguido de Trader 2. Luego, el comerciante 1 tiene la opción de colocar una operación de última hora justo antes de que se cierre el mercado. Si los comerciantes estuvieran jugando sus estrategias miopicalmente óptimas, así es como debería funcionar el mercado: si el comerciante 1 ve un 0, se movería a algún punto Y que esté entre A y C, pero más cercano a C. Trader 2 luego inferiría a ese comercianteRecibí una señal 0 y muévete a A o C si ella obtuvo 1 o 0 respectivamente. El comerciante 1 no tiene motivos para moverse nuevamente. Si Trader 1 hubiera obtenido un 1, él se mudaría a un punto diferente X, y Trader 2 se mudaría a D si viera 1 y B si viera 0. Nuevamente, el comerciante 1 no querría volver a moverse. Usando el juego de proyección, es fácil demostrar que, si los comerciantes consideran estrategias no miopas, este conjunto de estrategias no es un equilibrio. La posición exacta de los puntos no importa;Todo lo que necesitamos es la posición relativa, y la observación de que, debido a la simetría perfecta en la configuración, los segmentos XY, BC y AD son paralelos entre sí. Ahora, suponga que Trader 1 tiene un 0. Podría mudarse a X en lugar de Y, para engañar a Trader 2 para que piense que obtuvo un 1. Luego, cuando el comerciante 2 se movió a, digamos, d, el comerciante 1 podría corregir la calificación a A. Para demostrar que esta es una desviación rentable, observe que esta estrategia es equivalente a jugar dos movimientos adicionales sobre la estrategia miopel miopel de Trader 1s de mudarse a Y. El primer movimiento, y x puede moverse hacia o lejos de la posición final óptima. El segundo movimiento, DA o BC, siempre está en la dirección correcta. Además, debido a que DA y BC son más largos que XY, y paralelos a XY, su proyección en la línea P final siempre será mayor 324 en valor absoluto que la proyección de XY, ¡independientemente de cuál sea la verdadera línea P! Por lo tanto, el engaño daría como resultado una ganancia esperada estrictamente mayor para el comerciante 1. Tenga en cuenta que este problema no es específico para la forma del juego de proyección: nuestros resultados de equivalencia muestran que podría surgir en el MSR o DPM (tal vez con una distribución previa diferente y diferentes valores numéricos). Observe también que un perfil de estrategia en el que ninguno de los comerciantes se movió en las dos primeras rondas, y el comerciante 1 se movió a X o Y sería un equilibrio perfecto para el subjuego en esta configuración. Sugerimos que un enfoque para mitigar este problema podría ser reduciendo el radio en cada movimiento. Esto esencialmente proporciona una forma de descuento que motiva a Trader 1 a tomar sus ganancias temprano en lugar de engañar al comerciante 2. Gráficamente, el factor de reducción correcto haría que los segmentos AD y BC sean más cortos que XY (ya que son acordes en un círculo más pequeño), lo que hace que la estrategia miope sea óptima.6. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro hemos presentado un juego geométrico simple, el juego de proyección, que puede servir como modelo para el comportamiento estratégico en los mercados de información, así como una herramienta para guiar el diseño de nuevos mercados de información. Hemos utilizado este modelo para analizar el costo, las ganancias y las estrategias de un comerciante en un mercado dinámico parimutuel, y demostramos que tanto el mercado dinámico parimutuel como la regla de puntuación del mercado esférico son estratégicamente equivalentes al juego de proyección restringido bajo una ligera distorsión delProbabilidades anteriores. El análisis general se basó en la suposición de que los comerciantes no intentan activamente engañar a otros comerciantes para obtener ganancias futuras. En la Sección 5, sin embargo, analizamos un pequeño mercado de ejemplo sin esta suposición. Demostramos que el juego de proyección se puede utilizar para analizar las estrategias de los comerciantes en este escenario y potencialmente para ayudar a diseñar mercados con mejores propiedades estratégicas. Nuestros resultados plantean varias preguntas abiertas muy interesantes. En primer lugar, los pagos del juego de proyección no se pueden implementar directamente en situaciones en las que la verdadera probabilidad no se revela en última instancia. Sería muy útil tener una transformación automática de un juego de proyección dado en otro juego en el que los pagos se puedan implementar con expectativa sin conocer la probabilidad y preserva las propiedades estratégicas del juego de proyección. En segundo lugar, dada la estricta conexión entre el juego de proyección y la regla de puntuación del mercado esférico, es natural preguntar si podemos encontrar una conexión tan fuerte con otras reglas de puntuación o si no, para comprender qué diferencias estratégicas están implícitas en la forma de la forma de la forma de la forma de la forma deregla de puntuación utilizada en el mercado. Finalmente, la existencia de estrategias manipuladoras de largo alcance en los mercados de la información es de gran interés. El ejemplo que estudiamos en la Sección 5 simplemente rasca la superficie de esta área. Un estudio general de esta clase de manipulaciones, junto con una caracterización de los mercados en el que puede o no puede surgir, sería muy útil para el diseño de los mercados de la información.7.

        "However, we believe that even in these cases, the projection game can be useful as a conceptual and analytical tool.",

        "Proof.",
        "The proof follows trivially from the definition of the costs and payoffs: If we consider a path from point x to point x , both the net change in the vector lengths and the net projection onto the p-line are completely determined by x and x .",

        "On the other hand, if there were two paths from (x, y) to (x , y ) with different profits, there would be a cyclic path with positive profit.",

        "The two cost function formulations are equivalent: C[x, x ] = Z l w=0 cos(x + we, e)dw = |x |−|x| ∀x, x , where e is the unit vector giving the direction of move.",
        "In addition, when x moves along the positive p-line, the payoff is equal to the cost, P(x, x ) = |x | − |x|.",
        "Proof. 1.",
        "The instantaneous price is c(x, e) = x · e/|x| = cos(x, e), where e is the direction of movement, and the result follows. 2.",
        "Since ¯x is on the positive p-line, q·¯x = |¯x| = |x|, hence P(x, ¯x) = q · (¯x − x) = |x| − x · q; the cost is 0 from the definition. 318 3.",
        "From Part 1, the cost of moving from x to the origin is C[x, 0] = Z l w=0 cos(x + we, e)dw = Z l w=0 (−1)dw = −|x|, where l = |x|, e = x/|x|.",
        "By the path-independence property, C[x, x ] = C[x, 0] + C[0, x ] = |x | − |x|.",
        "Finally, a point on the positive p-line gets projected to itself, namely q · x = |x| so when the movement is along the positive p-line, P(x, x ) = q · (x − x) = |x | − |x| = C[x, x ].",

        "Further, we observe that the price is non-decreasing with increasing l. Thus, along the direction e, the profit is maximized at the point of intersection with the p-line.",
        "By Lemma 2, there is always a path from x to the positive p-line with 0 cost, which is given by an arc of the circle with center at the origin and radius |x|.",

        "Thus, for any point x, we can define the profit potential φ(x, p) by φ(x, p) = |x| − x · q.",
        "Note, the potential is positive for x off the positive p-line and zero for x on the line.",

        "Constraints in the DPM Although it might seem, based on the costs, that any move in the projection game has an equivalent move in the DPM, the DPM places some constraints on trades.",
        "Firstly, no trader is allowed to have a net negative holding in either share.",
        "This is important, because it ensures that the total holdings in each share are always positive.",
        "However, this is a boundary constraint, and does not impact the strategic choices for a player with a sufficiently large positive holding in each share.",
        "Thus, we can ignore this constraint from a first-order strategic analysis of the DPM.",
        "Secondly, for practical reasons a DPM will probably have a minimum unit of trade, but we assume here that arbitrarily small quantities can be traded.",
        "Payoffs in the DPM At some point, trading in the DPM ceases and shares are liquidated.",
        "We assume here that the true probability becomes known at liquidation time, and describe the payoffs in terms of the probability; however, if the probability is not revealed, only the event that actually occurs, these payoffs can be implemented in expectation.",
        "Suppose the DPM terminates in a state (M, x, y), and the true probability of event A is p.

However, because the actual payoff of a move depends on the future moves, players must base their decisions on some belief about the final state of the market.",
        "In the light of Lemma 5, one natural, rational-expectation style assumption is that the final state (M, x∗ , y∗ ) will satisfy x∗ y∗ = q p 1−p .

        "Using this equivalence, we can transfer all the strategic properties proven for the projection game directly to the analysis of the dynamic parimutuel market.",
        "One particularly interesting conclusion we can draw is as follows: In the absence of any constraint that disallows it, it is always profitable for an agent to move towards the origin, by selling shares in both A and B while maintaining the ratio x/y.",
        "In the DPM, this is limited by forbidding short sales, so players can never have negative holdings in either share.",
        "As a result, when their holding in one share (say A) is 0, they cant use the strategy of moving towards the origin.",
        "We can conclude that a rational player should never hold shares of both A and B simultaneously, regardless of her beliefs and the market position.",
        "This discussion leads us to consider a modified DPM, in which this strategic loophole is addressed directly: Instead of disallowing all short sales, we place a constraint that no agent ever reduce the total market capitalization M (or, alternatively, that any agents total investment in the market is always non-negative).",
        "We call this the nondecreasing market capitalization constraint for the DPM.",
        "This corresponds to a restriction that no move in the projection game reduces the radius.",
        "However, we can conclude from the preceding discussion that players have no incentive to ever increase the radius.",
        "Thus, the moves of the projection game would all lie on the quarter circle in the positive quadrant, with radius determined by the market makers move.",
        "In section 4, we show that the projection game on this quarter circle is strategically equivalent (at least myopically) to trade in a Market Scoring Rule.",

        "Then, analysis of strategies in the projection game with a slightly distorted distribution over p can be used to understand the strategic properties of the original market situation.",
        "Implementation in expectation Another important consequence of Theorem 9 is that the restricted projection game can be implemented with a small distortion in the probability distribution over values of p, by using a Spherical Scoring Rule to implement the payoffs.",
        "This makes the projection game valuable as a design tool; for example, we can analyze new constraints and rules in the projection game, and then implement them via the SSR.",
        "Unfortunately, the result does not extend to unrestricted projection games, because the relative profit of moving along the circle versus changing radius is not preserved through this transformation.",
        "However, it is possible to extend the transformation to projection games in which the radius ri after the ith move is a fixed function of i (not necessarily constant), so that it is not within the strategic control of the player making the move; such games can also be strategically implemented via the spherical scoring rule (with distortion of priors). 4.2 Connection to other scoring rules In this section, we show a weaker similarity between the projection game and the MSR with other scoring rules.",
        "We prove an infinitesimal similarity between the restricted projection game and the MSR with log scoring rule; the result generalizes to all proper scoring rules that have a unique local and global maximum.",
        "A geometric visualization of some common scoring rules in two dimensions is depicted in Figure 3.",
        "The score curves in the figure are defined by {(s1(r), s2(r)) | r = (r, 1 − r), r ∈ [0, 1]}.",
        "Similarly to the projection game, define the profit potential of a probability r in MSR to be the change in profit for moving from r to the optimum p, φMSR(s(r), p) = profitMSR[s(r), s(p)].",
        "We will show that the profit potentials in the two games have analogous roles for analyzing the optimal strategies, in particular both potential functions have a global minimum 0 at r = p. Theorem 10.",
        "Consider the projection game restricted to the non-negative unit circle where strategies x have the natural one-to-one correspondence to probability distributions r = (r, 1 − r) given by x = ( r |r| , 1−r |r| ).",
        "Trade in a log market scoring rule is strategically similar to trade in the projection game on the quarter-circle, in that d dr φ(s(r), p) < 0 for r < p d dr φ(s(r), p) > 0 for r > p, both for the projection game and MSR potentials φ(.).",
        "Proof. (sketch) The derivative of the MSR potential is d dr φ(s(r), p) = −p · d dr s(r) = − X i pisi(r).",
        "For the log scoring rule si(r) = ai + b log ri with b > 0, d dr φMSR(s(r), p) = −p · b r , − b 1 − r = −b p r − 1 − p 1 − r = b r − p r(1 − r) .",
        "Since r = (r, 1 − r) is a probability distribution, this expression is positive for r > p and negative for r < p as desired.",
        "Now, consider the projection game on the non-negative unit circle.",
        "The potential for any x = ( r |r| , 1−r |r| ) is given by φ(x(r), p) = |x| − q · x(r), It is easy to show that d dr φ(x(r), p) < 0 for r < p and the derivative is positive for r > p, so the potential function along the circle is decreasing and then increasing with r similarly to an energy function, with a global minimum at r = p, as desired.",
        "Theorem 10 establishes that the market log-scoring rule is strategically similar to the projection game played on a circle, in the sense that the optimal direction of movement at the current state is the same in both games.",
        "For example, if the current state is r < p, it is profitable to move to r+dr since the effective profit of that move is profit(r, r ) = φ(s(r), p) − φ(s(r + dr), p) > 0.",
        "Although stated for logscoring rules, the theorem holds for any scoring rules that induce a potential with a unique local and global minimum at p, such as the quadratic scoring rule and others. 5.",
        "USING THEPROJECTION-GAMEMODEL The chief advantages of the projection game are that it is analytically tractable, and also easy to visualize.",
        "In Section 3, we used the projection-game model of the DPM to prove the absence of arbitrage, and to infer strategic properties that might have been difficult to deduce otherwise.",
        "In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about more complex strategic settings. 323 5.1 Traders with inertia The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the market forms we have studied asserts that traders who disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to trade in the market.",
        "The expected gain may, however, be very small.",
        "A plausible model of real trader behavior might include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than some constant .",
        "We do not attempt to justify this model here; rather, we illustrate how the projection game may be used to analyze such situations, and shed some light on how to modify the trading rules to alleviate this problem.",
        "Consider the simple projection game restricted to a circular arc with unit radius; as we have seen, this corresponds closely to the spherical market scoring rule, and to the dynamic parimutuel market under a reasonable constraint.",
        "Now, suppose the market probability is p, and a trader believes the true probability is p .",
        "Then, his expected gain can be calculated, as follows: Let q and q be the unit vectors in the directions of p and p respectively.",
        "The expected profit is given by E = φ(q, p ) = 1− q ·q .",
        "Thus, the trader will trade only if 1−q·q > .",
        "If we let θ and θ be the angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis), we get E = 1 − cos(θ − θ ); when θ is close to θ , a Taylor series approximation gives us that E ≈ (θ − θ )2 /2.",
        "Thus, we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy: The market price will not change as long as (θ − θ )2 ≤ 2 .",
        "Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market.",
        "One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.",
        "This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy.",
        "However, it will also increase the market-makers exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this.",
        "The projection game model suggests a natural approach to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds on the market makers loss.",
        "The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move.",
        "Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1.",
        "Then, the traders expected profit would be E = r(1 − cos(θ − θ )).",
        "Using the same approximation as above, the trader would trade as long as (θ − θ )2 > 2 /r.",
        "Now, even if the market maker seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase with every trade. 5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not consider the impact of their trades on other traders beliefs.",
        "In practice, an informed trader can potentially profit by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders, in a way that allows her to profit later.",
        "In this section, we illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze an instance of this phenomenon, and to design market rules that mitigate this effect.",
        "The scenario we consider is as follows.",
        "There are two traders speculating on the probability of an event E, who each get a 1-bit signal.",
        "The optimal probability for each 2bit signal pair is as follows.",
        "If trader 1 gets the signal 0, and trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal probability is 0.3.",
        "If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is 0.9.",
        "If trader 1 gets 1, and trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal probability is 0.7.",
        "If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is 0.1. (Note that the impact of trader 2s signal is in a different direction, depending on trader 1s signal).",
        "Suppose that the prior distribution of the signals is that trader 1 is equally likely to get a 0 or a 1, but trader 2 gets a 0 with probability 0.55 and a 1 with probability 0.45.",
        "The traders are playing the projection game restricted to a circular arc.",
        "This setup is depicted in Figure 4.",
        "A B D C X Y Signals Opt.",
        "Pt 00 C D11 10 01 Event does not happenEventhappens B A Figure 4: Example illustrating non-myopic deception Suppose that, for some exogenous reason, trader 1 has the opportunity to trade, followed by trader 2.",
        "Then, trader 1 has the option of placing a last-minute trade just before the market closes.",
        "If traders were playing their myopically optimal strategies, here is how the market should run: If trader 1 sees a 0, he would move to some point Y that is between A and C, but closer to C. Trader 2 would then infer that trader 1 received a 0 signal and move to A or C if she got 1 or 0 respectively.",
        "Trader 1 has no reason to move again.",
        "If trader 1 had got a 1, he would move to a different point X instead, and trader 2 would move to D if she saw 1 and B if she saw 0.",
        "Again, trader 1 would not want to move again.",
        "Using the projection game, it is easy to show that, if traders consider non-myopic strategies, this set of strategies is not an equilibrium.",
        "The exact position of the points does not matter; all we need is the relative position, and the observation that, because of the perfect symmetry in the setup, segments XY, BC, and AD are all parallel to each other.",
        "Now, suppose trader 1 got a 0.",
        "He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.",
        "Then, when trader 2 moved to, say, D, trader 1 could correct the rating to A.",
        "To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to playing two additional moves over trader 1s myopic strategy of moving to Y .",
        "The first move, Y X may either move toward or away from the optimal final position.",
        "The second move, DA or BC, is always in the correct direction.",
        "Further, because DA and BC are longer than XY , and parallel to XY , their projection on the final p-line will always be greater 324 in absolute value than the projection of XY , regardless of what the true p-line is!",
        "Thus, the deception would result in a strictly higher expected profit for trader 1.",
        "Note that this problem is not specific to the projection game form: Our equivalence results show that it could arise in the MSR or DPM (perhaps with a different prior distribution and different numerical values).",
        "Observe also that a strategy profile in which neither trader moved in the first two rounds, and trader 1 moved to either X or Y would be a subgame-perfect equilibrium in this setup.",
        "We suggest that one approach to mitigating this problem might be by reducing the radius at every move.",
        "This essentially provides a form of discounting that motivates trader 1 to take his profit early rather than mislead trader 2.",
        "Graphically, the right reduction factor would make the segments AD and BC shorter than XY (as they are chords on a smaller circle), thus making the myopic strategy optimal. 6.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented a simple geometric game, the projection game, that can serve as a model for strategic behavior in information markets, as well as a tool to guide the design of new information markets.",
        "We have used this model to analyze the cost, profit, and strategies of a trader in a dynamic parimutuel market, and shown that both the dynamic parimutuel market and the spherical market scoring rule are strategically equivalent to the restricted projection game under slight distortion of the prior probabilities.",
        "The general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit.",
        "In section 5, however, we analyze a small example market without this assumption.",
        "We demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties.",
        "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
        "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
        "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
        "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
        "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
        "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",
        "A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.",

                "We note that while the MSR with the spherical scoring rule somewhat resembles the projection game, due to the mathematical similarity of their profit expressions, the DPM model is markedly different and thus its equivalence to the projection game is especially striking.",

                "Lastly, we illustrate how the projection game model can be used to analyze the potential for manipulation of information markets for long-term gain.2 We present an example scenario in which such manipulation can occur, and suggest additional rules that might mitigate the possibility of manipulation.",
                "We also illustrate another application to analyzing how a market maker can improve the prediction accuracy of a market in which traders will not trade unless their expected profit is above a threshold. 1.2 Related Work Numerous studies have demonstrated empirically that market prices are good predictors of future events, and seem to aggregate the collected wisdom of all the traders [2, 3, 12, 1, 5, 16].",
                "This effect has also been demonstrated in laboratory studies [13, 14], and has theoretical support in the literature of rational expectations [9].",

                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",

                "Now, suppose trader 1 got a 0.",
                "He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.",

                "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",
                "A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.",

                "In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about more complex strategic settings. 323 5.1 Traders with inertia The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the market forms we have studied asserts that traders who disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to trade in the market.",
                "The expected gain may, however, be very small.",
                "A plausible model of real trader behavior might include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than some constant .",

                "If we let θ and θ be the angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis), we get E = 1 − cos(θ − θ ); when θ is close to θ , a Taylor series approximation gives us that E ≈ (θ − θ )2 /2.",
                "Thus, we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy: The market price will not change as long as (θ − θ )2 ≤ 2 .",
                "Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market.",
                "One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.",
                "This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy.",
                "However, it will also increase the market-makers exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this.",
                "The projection game model suggests a natural approach to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds on the market makers loss.",
                "The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move.",
                "Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1.",
                "Then, the traders expected profit would be E = r(1 − cos(θ − θ )).",
                "Using the same approximation as above, the trader would trade as long as (θ − θ )2 > 2 /r.",
                "Now, even if the market maker seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase with every trade. 5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not consider the impact of their trades on other traders beliefs.",

                "He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.",

                "To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to playing two additional moves over trader 1s myopic strategy of moving to Y .",

                "Using the projection game, it is easy to show that, if traders consider non-myopic strategies, this set of strategies is not an equilibrium.",
                "The exact position of the points does not matter; all we need is the relative position, and the observation that, because of the perfect symmetry in the setup, segments XY, BC, and AD are all parallel to each other.",
                "Now, suppose trader 1 got a 0.",
                "He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.",

                "To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to playing two additional moves over trader 1s myopic strategy of moving to Y .",

                "The second move, DA or BC, is always in the correct direction.",
                "Further, because DA and BC are longer than XY , and parallel to XY , their projection on the final p-line will always be greater 324 in absolute value than the projection of XY , regardless of what the true p-line is!",
                "Thus, the deception would result in a strictly higher expected profit for trader 1.",
                "Note that this problem is not specific to the projection game form: Our equivalence results show that it could arise in the MSR or DPM (perhaps with a different prior distribution and different numerical values).",
                "Observe also that a strategy profile in which neither trader moved in the first two rounds, and trader 1 moved to either X or Y would be a subgame-perfect equilibrium in this setup.",
                "We suggest that one approach to mitigating this problem might be by reducing the radius at every move.",
                "This essentially provides a form of discounting that motivates trader 1 to take his profit early rather than mislead trader 2.",
                "Graphically, the right reduction factor would make the segments AD and BC shorter than XY (as they are chords on a smaller circle), thus making the myopic strategy optimal. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented a simple geometric game, the projection game, that can serve as a model for strategic behavior in information markets, as well as a tool to guide the design of new information markets.",
                "We have used this model to analyze the cost, profit, and strategies of a trader in a dynamic parimutuel market, and shown that both the dynamic parimutuel market and the spherical <br>market scoring rule</br> are strategically equivalent to the restricted projection game under slight distortion of the prior probabilities.",
                "The general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit.",

                "We demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties.",
                "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
                "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical <br>market scoring rule</br>, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",
                "A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.",

                "In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about more complex strategic settings. 323 5.1 Traders with inertia The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the market forms we have studied asserts that traders who disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to trade in the market.",
                "The expected gain may, however, be very small.",
                "A plausible model of real trader behavior might include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than some constant .",

                "If we let θ and θ be the angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis), we get E = 1 − cos(θ − θ ); when θ is close to θ , a Taylor series approximation gives us that E ≈ (θ − θ )2 /2.",
                "Thus, we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy: The market price will not change as long as (θ − θ )2 ≤ 2 .",
                "Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market.",
                "One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.",
                "This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy.",
                "However, it will also increase the market-makers exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this.",
                "The projection game model suggests a natural approach to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds on the market makers loss.",
                "The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move.",
                "Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1.",
                "Then, the traders expected profit would be E = r(1 − cos(θ − θ )).",
                "Using the same approximation as above, the trader would trade as long as (θ − θ )2 > 2 /r.",
                "Now, even if the market maker seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase with every trade. 5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not consider the impact of their trades on other traders beliefs.",
                "In practice, an informed trader can potentially profit by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders, in a way that allows her to profit later.",

                "Suppose that the prior distribution of the signals is that trader 1 is equally likely to get a 0 or a 1, but trader 2 gets a 0 with probability 0.55 and a 1 with probability 0.45.",

                "If traders were playing their myopically optimal strategies, here is how the market should run: If trader 1 sees a 0, he would move to some point Y that is between A and C, but closer to C. Trader 2 would then infer that trader 1 received a 0 signal and move to A or C if she got 1 or 0 respectively.",

                "He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.",

                "To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to playing two additional moves over trader 1s myopic strategy of moving to Y .",

                "The general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit.",
                "In section 5, however, we analyze a small example market without this assumption.",
                "We demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties.",
                "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
                "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of <br>long-range manipulative strategies</br> in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",

                "Since r = (r, 1 − r) is a probability distribution, this expression is positive for r > p and negative for r < p as desired.",

                "The potential for any x = ( r |r| , 1−r |r| ) is given by φ(x(r), p) = |x| − q · x(r), It is easy to show that d dr φ(x(r), p) < 0 for r < p and the derivative is positive for r > p, so the potential function along the circle is decreasing and then increasing with r similarly to an energy function, with a global minimum at r = p, as desired.",
                "Theorem 10 establishes that the market log-scoring rule is strategically similar to the projection game played on a circle, in the sense that the optimal direction of movement at the current state is the same in both games.",
                "For example, if the current state is r < p, it is profitable to move to r+dr since the effective profit of that move is profit(r, r ) = φ(s(r), p) − φ(s(r + dr), p) > 0.",
                "Although stated for logscoring rules, the theorem holds for any scoring rules that induce a potential with a unique local and global minimum at p, such as the quadratic scoring rule and others. 5.",
                "USING THEPROJECTION-GAMEMODEL The chief advantages of the projection game are that it is analytically tractable, and also easy to visualize.",
                "In Section 3, we used the projection-game model of the DPM to prove the absence of arbitrage, and to infer strategic properties that might have been difficult to deduce otherwise.",
                "In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about more complex strategic settings. 323 5.1 Traders with inertia The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the market forms we have studied asserts that traders who disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to trade in the market.",
                "The expected gain may, however, be very small.",
                "A plausible model of real trader behavior might include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than some constant .",
                "We do not attempt to justify this model here; rather, we illustrate how the projection game may be used to analyze such situations, and shed some light on how to modify the trading rules to alleviate this problem.",
                "Consider the simple projection game restricted to a circular arc with unit radius; as we have seen, this corresponds closely to the spherical market scoring rule, and to the dynamic parimutuel market under a reasonable constraint.",
                "Now, suppose the market probability is p, and a trader believes the true probability is p .",
                "Then, his expected gain can be calculated, as follows: Let q and q be the unit vectors in the directions of p and p respectively.",
                "The expected profit is given by E = φ(q, p ) = 1− q ·q .",
                "Thus, the trader will trade only if 1−q·q > .",
                "If we let θ and θ be the angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis), we get E = 1 − cos(θ − θ ); when θ is close to θ , a Taylor series approximation gives us that E ≈ (θ − θ )2 /2.",
                "Thus, we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy: The market price will not change as long as (θ − θ )2 ≤ 2 .",
                "Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market.",
                "One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.",
                "This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy.",
                "However, it will also increase the market-makers exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this.",
                "The projection game model suggests a natural approach to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds on the market makers loss.",
                "The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move.",
                "Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1.",
                "Then, the traders expected profit would be E = r(1 − cos(θ − θ )).",
                "Using the same approximation as above, the trader would trade as long as (θ − θ )2 > 2 /r.",
                "Now, even if the market maker seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase with every trade. 5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not consider the impact of their trades on other traders beliefs.",
                "In practice, an informed trader can potentially profit by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders, in a way that allows her to profit later.",
                "In this section, we illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze an instance of this phenomenon, and to design market rules that mitigate this effect.",
                "The scenario we consider is as follows.",

                "If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is 0.1. (Note that the impact of trader 2s signal is in a different direction, depending on trader 1s signal).",
                "Suppose that the prior distribution of the signals is that trader 1 is equally likely to get a 0 or a 1, but trader 2 gets a 0 with probability 0.55 and a 1 with probability 0.45.",
                "The traders are playing the projection game restricted to a circular arc.",

                "If traders were playing their myopically optimal strategies, here is how the market should run: If trader 1 sees a 0, he would move to some point Y that is between A and C, but closer to C. Trader 2 would then infer that trader 1 received a 0 signal and move to A or C if she got 1 or 0 respectively.",
                "Trader 1 has no reason to move again.",

                "Using the projection game, it is easy to show that, if traders consider non-myopic strategies, this set of strategies is not an equilibrium.",
                "The exact position of the points does not matter; all we need is the relative position, and the observation that, because of the perfect symmetry in the setup, segments XY, BC, and AD are all parallel to each other.",
                "Now, suppose trader 1 got a 0.",
                "He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.",
                "Then, when trader 2 moved to, say, D, trader 1 could correct the rating to A.",
                "To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to playing two additional moves over trader 1s myopic strategy of moving to Y .",
                "The first move, Y X may either move toward or away from the optimal final position.",
                "The second move, DA or BC, is always in the correct direction.",
                "Further, because DA and BC are longer than XY , and parallel to XY , their projection on the final p-line will always be greater 324 in absolute value than the projection of XY , regardless of what the true p-line is!",
                "Thus, the deception would result in a strictly higher expected profit for trader 1.",
                "Note that this problem is not specific to the projection game form: Our equivalence results show that it could arise in the MSR or DPM (perhaps with a different prior distribution and different numerical values).",
                "Observe also that a strategy profile in which neither trader moved in the first two rounds, and trader 1 moved to either X or Y would be a subgame-perfect equilibrium in this setup.",
                "We suggest that one approach to mitigating this problem might be by reducing the radius at every move.",
                "This essentially provides a form of discounting that motivates trader 1 to take his profit early rather than mislead trader 2.",
                "Graphically, the right reduction factor would make the segments AD and BC shorter than XY (as they are chords on a smaller circle), thus making the myopic strategy optimal. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented a simple geometric game, the projection game, that can serve as a model for strategic behavior in information markets, as well as a tool to guide the design of new information markets.",
                "We have used this model to analyze the cost, profit, and strategies of a trader in a dynamic parimutuel market, and shown that both the dynamic parimutuel market and the spherical market scoring rule are strategically equivalent to the restricted projection game under slight distortion of the prior probabilities.",
                "The general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit.",
                "In section 5, however, we analyze a small example market without this assumption.",
                "We demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties.",
                "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
                "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",
                "A general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 7.",

                "The proof follows trivially from the definition of the costs and payoffs: If we consider a path from point x to point x , both the net change in the vector lengths and the net projection onto the p-line are completely determined by x and x .",
                "Although simple, path independence of profits is vitally important, because it implies (and is implied by) the absence of arbitrage in the market.",
                "In other words, there is no sequence of moves that start and end at the same point, but result in a positive profit.",
                "On the other hand, if there were two paths from (x, y) to (x , y ) with different profits, there would be a cyclic path with positive profit.",

                "The expected gain may, however, be very small.",

                "If we let θ and θ be the angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis), we get E = 1 − cos(θ − θ ); when θ is close to θ , a Taylor series approximation gives us that E ≈ (θ − θ )2 /2.",
                "Thus, we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy: The market price will not change as long as (θ − θ )2 ≤ 2 .",
                "Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market.",
                "One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.",
                "This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy.",
                "However, it will also increase the market-makers exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this.",
                "The projection game model suggests a natural approach to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds on the market makers loss.",
                "The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move.",
                "Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1.",
                "Then, the traders expected profit would be E = r(1 − cos(θ − θ )).",
                "Using the same approximation as above, the trader would trade as long as (θ − θ )2 > 2 /r.",
                "Now, even if the market maker seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase with every trade. 5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not consider the impact of their trades on other traders beliefs.",

                "Our results raise several very interesting open questions.",
                "Firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.",
                "It would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.",
                "Second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.",
                "Finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in information markets is of great interest.",
                "The example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.",
