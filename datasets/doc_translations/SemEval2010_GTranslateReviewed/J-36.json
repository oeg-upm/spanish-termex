In real life, however, people are often unaware of the utility of taking a particular action until they perform research into its consequences. In this paper, we model this phenomenon. We imagine a player engaged in a questionand-answer session, asking questions both about his or her own preferences and about the state of reality; thus we call this setting Socratic game theory. In a Socratic game, players begin with an a priori probability distribution over many possible worlds, with a different utility function for each world. Players can make queries, at some cost, to learn partial information about which of the possible worlds is the actual world, before choosing an action. We consider two query models: (1) an unobservable-query model, in which players learn only the response to their own queries, and (2) an observable-query model, in which players also learn which queries their opponents made. The results in this paper consider cases in which the underlying worlds of a two-player Socratic game are either constant-sum games or strategically zero-sum games, a class that generalizes constant-sum games to include all games in which the sum of payoffs depends linearly on the interaction between the players. When the underlying worlds are constant sum, we give polynomial-time algorithms to find Nash equilibria in both the observable- and unobservable-query models. When the worlds are strategically zero sum, we give efficient algorithms to find Nash equilibria in unobservablequery Socratic games and correlated equilibria in observablequery Socratic games.

INTRODUCTION Late October 1960. A smoky room. Democratic Party strategists huddle around a map. How should the Kennedy campaign allocate its remaining advertising budget? Should it focus on, say, California or New York? The Nixon campaign faces the same dilemma. Of course, neither campaign knows the effectiveness of its advertising in each state. Perhaps Californians are susceptible to Nixons advertising, but are unresponsive to Kennedys. In light of this uncertainty, the Kennedy campaign may conduct a survey, at some cost, to estimate the effectiveness of its advertising. Moreover, the larger-and more expensive-the survey, the more accurate it will be. Is the cost of a survey worth the information that it provides? How should one balance the cost of acquiring more information against the risk of playing a game with higher uncertainty? In this paper, we model situations of this type as Socratic games. As in traditional game theory, the players in a Socratic game choose actions to maximize their payoffs, but we model players with incomplete information who can make costly queries to reduce their uncertainty about the state of the world before they choose their actions. This approach contrasts with traditional game theory, in which players are usually modeled as having fixed, exogenously given information about the structure of the game and its payoffs. (In traditional games of incomplete and imperfect information, there is information that the players do not have; in Socratic games, unlike in these games, the players have a chance to acquire the missing information, at some cost.) A number of related models have been explored by economists and computer scientists motivated by similar situations, often with a focus on mechanism design and auctions; a sampling of this research includes the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44], Parkes [59], Fong [22], Compte and Jehiel [12], Rezende [63], Persico and Matthews [48, 60], Cr´emer and Khalil [15], Rasmusen [62], and Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5]. The model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki is similar in many regards to the one that we explore here; see Section 7 for some discussion. A Socratic game proceeds as follows. A real world is cho150 sen randomly from a set of possible worlds according to a common prior distribution. Each player then selects an arbitrary query from a set of available costly queries and receives a corresponding piece of information about the real world. Finally each player selects an action and receives a payoff-a function of the players selected actions and the identity of the real world-less the cost of the query that he or she made. Compared to traditional game theory, the distinguishing feature of our model is the introduction of explicit costs to the players for learning arbitrary partial information about which of the many possible worlds is the real world. Our research was initially inspired by recent results in psychology on decision making, but it soon became clear that Socratic game theory is also a general tool for understanding the exploitation versus exploration tradeoff, well studied in machine learning, in a strategic multiplayer environment. This tension between the risk arising from uncertainty and the cost of acquiring information is ubiquitous in economics, political science, and beyond. Our results. We consider Socratic games under two models: an unobservable-query model where players learn only the response to their own queries and an observable-query model where players also learn which queries their opponents made. We give efficient algorithms to find Nash equilibriai.e., tuples of strategies from which no player has unilateral incentive to deviate-in broad classes of two-player Socratic games in both models. Our first result is an efficient algorithm to find Nash equilibria in unobservable-query Socratic games with constant-sum worlds, in which the sum of the players payoffs is independent of their actions. Our techniques also yield Nash equilibria in unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds. Strategically zero-sum games generalize constant-sum games by allowing the sum of the players payoffs to depend on individual players choices of strategy, but not on any interaction of their choices. Our second result is an efficient algorithm to find Nash equilibria in observable-query Socratic games with constant-sum worlds. Finally, we give an efficient algorithm to find correlated equilibria-a weaker but increasingly well-studied solution concept for games [2, 3, 32, 56, 57]-in observable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds. Like all games, Socratic games can be viewed as a special case of extensive-form games, which represent games by trees in which internal nodes represent choices made by chance or by the players, and the leaves represent outcomes that correspond to a vector of payoffs to the players. Algorithmically, the generality of extensive-form games makes them difficult to solve efficiently, and the special cases that are known to be efficiently solvable do not include even simple Socratic games. Every (complete-information) classical game is a trivial Socratic game (with a single possible world and a single trivial query), and efficiently finding Nash equilibria in classical games has been shown to be hard [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55]. Therefore we would not expect to find a straightforward polynomial-time algorithm to compute Nash equilibria in general Socratic games. However, it is well known that Nash equilibria can be found efficiently via an LP for two-player constant-sum games [49, 71] (and strategically zero-sum games [51]). A Socratic game is itself a classical game, so one might hope that these results can be applied to Socratic games with constant-sum (or strategically zero-sum) worlds. We face two major obstacles in extending these classical results to Socratic games. First, a Socratic game with constant-sum worlds is not itself a constant-sum classical game-rather, the resulting classical game is only strategically zero sum. Worse yet, a Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds is not itself classically strategically zero sum-indeed, there are no known efficient algorithmic techniques to compute Nash equilibria in the resulting class of classical games. (Exponential-time algorithms like Lemke/Howson, of course, can be used [45].) Thus even when it is easy to find Nash equilibria in each of the worlds of a Socratic game, we require new techniques to solve the Socratic game itself. Second, even when the Socratic game itself is strategically zero sum, the number of possible strategies available to each player is exponential in the natural representation of the game. As a result, the standard linear programs for computing equilibria have an exponential number of variables and an exponential number of constraints. For unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds, we address these obstacles by formulating a new LP that uses only polynomially many variables (though still an exponential number of constraints) and then use ellipsoid-based techniques to solve it. For observablequery Socratic games, we handle the exponentiality by decomposing the game into stages, solving the stages separately, and showing how to reassemble the solutions efficiently. To solve the stages, it is necessary to find Nash equilibria in Bayesian strategically zero-sum games, and we give an explicit polynomial-time algorithm to do so. 2. GAMES AND SOCRATIC GAMES In this section, we review background on game theory and formally introduce Socratic games. We present these models in the context of two-player games, but the multiplayer case is a natural extension. Throughout the paper, boldface variables will be used to denote a pair of variables (e.g., a = ai, aii ). Let Pr[x ← π] denote the probability that a particular value x is drawn from the distribution π, and let Ex∼π[g(x)] denote the expectation of g(x) when x is drawn from π. 2.1 Background on Game Theory Consider two players, Player I and Player II, each of whom is attempting to maximize his or her utility (or payoff). A (two-player) game is a pair A, u , where, for i ∈ {i,ii}, • Ai is the set of pure strategies for Player i, and A = Ai, Aii ; and • ui : A → R is the utility function for Player i, and u = ui, uii . We require that A and u be common knowledge. If each Player i chooses strategy ai ∈ Ai, then the payoffs to Players I and II are ui(a) and uii(a), respectively. A game is constant sum if, for all a ∈ A, we have that ui(a) + uii(a) = c for some fixed c independent of a. Player i can also play a mixed strategy αi ∈ Ai, where Ai denotes the space of probability measures over the set Ai. Payoff functions are generalized as ui (α) = ui (αi, αii) := Ea∼α[ui (a)] = P a∈A α(a)ui (a), where the quantity α(a) = 151 αi(ai) · αii(aii) denotes the joint probability of the independent events that each Player i chooses action ai from the distribution αi. This generalization to mixed strategies is known as von Neumann/Morgenstern utility [70], in which players are indifferent between a guaranteed payoff x and an expected payoff of x. A Nash equilibrium is a pair α of mixed strategies so that neither player has an incentive to change his or her strategy unilaterally. Formally, the strategy pair α is a Nash equilibrium if and only if both ui(αi, αii) = maxαi∈Ai ui(αi, αii) and uii(αi, αii) = maxαii∈Aii uii(αi, αii); that is, the strategies αi and αii are mutual best responses. A correlated equilibrium is a distribution ψ over A that obeys the following: if a ∈ A is drawn randomly according to ψ and Player i learns ai, then no Player i has incentive to deviate unilaterally from playing ai. (A Nash equilibrium is a correlated equilibrium in which ψ(a) = αi(ai) · αii(aii) is a product distribution.) Formally, in a correlated equilibrium, for every a ∈ A we must have that ai is a best response to a randomly chosen ˆaii ∈ Aii drawn according to ψ(ai, ˆaii), and the analogous condition must hold for Player II. 2.2 Socratic Games In this section, we formally define Socratic games. A Socratic game is a 7-tuple A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ , where, for i ∈ {i,ii}: • Ai is, as before, the set of pure strategies for Player i. • W is a set of possible worlds, one of which is the real world wreal. • ui = {uw i : A → R | w ∈ W} is a set of payoff functions for Player i, one for each possible world. • S is a set of signals. • Qi is a set of available queries for Player i. When Player i makes query qi : W → S, he or she receives the signal qi(wreal). When Player i receives signal qi(wreal) in response to query qi, he or she can infer that wreal ∈ {w : qi(w) = qi(wreal)}, i.e., the set of possible worlds from which query qi cannot distinguish wreal. • p : W → [0, 1] is a probability distribution over the possible worlds. • δi : Qi → R≥0 gives the query cost for each available query for Player i. Initially, the world wreal is chosen according to the probability distribution p, but the identity of wreal remains unknown to the players. That is, it is as if the players are playing the game A, uwreal but do not know wreal. The players make queries q ∈ Q, and Player i receives the signal qi(wreal). We consider both observable queries and unobservable queries. When queries are observable, each player learns which query was made by the other player, and the results of his or her own query-that is, each Player i learns qi, qii, and qi(wreal). For unobservable queries, Player i learns only qi and qi(wreal). After learning the results of the queries, the players select strategies a ∈ A and receive as payoffs u wreal i (a) − δi(qi). In the Socratic game, a pure strategy for Player i consists of a query qi ∈ Qi and a response function mapping any result of the query qi to a strategy ai ∈ Ai to play. A players state of knowledge after a query is a point in R := Q × S or Ri := Qi × S for observable or unobservable queries, respectively. Thus Player is response function maps R or Ri to Ai. Note that the number of pure strategies is exponential, as there are exponentially many response functions. A mixed strategy involves both randomly choosing a query qi ∈ Qi and randomly choosing an action ai ∈ Ai in response to the results of the query. Formally, we will consider a mixed-strategy-function profile f = fquery , fresp to have two parts: • a function fquery i : Qi → [0, 1], where fquery i (qi) is the probability that Player i makes query qi. • a function fresp i that maps R or Ri to a probability distribution over actions. Player i chooses an action ai ∈ Ai according to the probability distribution fresp i (q, qi(w)) for observable queries, and according to fresp i (qi, qi(w)) for unobservable queries. (With unobservable queries, for example, the probability that Player I plays action ai conditioned on making query qi in world w is given by Pr[ai ← fresp i (qi, qi(w))].) Mixed strategies are typically defined as probability distributions over the pure strategies, but here we represent a mixed strategy by a pair fquery , fresp , which is commonly referred to as a behavioral strategy in the game-theory literature. As in any game with perfect recall, one can easily map a mixture of pure strategies to a behavioral strategy f = fquery , fresp that induces the same probability of making a particular query qi or playing a particular action after making a query qi in a particular world. Thus it suffices to consider only this representation of mixed strategies. For a strategy-function profile f for observable queries, the (expected) payoff to Player i is given by X q∈Q,w∈W,a∈A 2 6 6 4 fquery i (qi) · fquery ii (qii) · p(w) · Pr[ai ← fresp i (q, qi(w))] · Pr[aii ← fresp ii (q, qii(w))] · (uw i (a) − δi(qi)) 3 7 7 5 . The payoffs for unobservable queries are analogous, with fresp j (qj, qj(w)) in place of fresp j (q, qj(w)). 3. STRATEGICALLY ZERO-SUM GAMES We can view a Socratic game G with constant-sum worlds as an exponentially large classical game, with pure strategies make query qi and respond according to fi. However, this classical game is not constant sum. The sum of the players payoffs varies depending upon their strategies, because different queries incur different costs. However, this game still has significant structure: the sum of payoffs varies only because of varying query costs. Thus the sum of payoffs does depend on players choice of strategies, but not on the interaction of their choices-i.e., for fixed functions gi and gii, we have ui(q, f) + uii(q, f) = gi(qi, fi) + gii(qii, fii) for all strategies q, f . Such games are called strategically zero sum and were introduced by Moulin and Vial [51], who describe a notion of strategic equivalence and define strategically zero-sum games as those strategically equivalent to zero-sum games. It is interesting to note that two Socratic games with the same queries and strategically equivalent worlds are not necessarily strategically equivalent. A game A, u is strategically zero sum if there exist labels (i, ai) for every Player i and every pure strategy ai ∈ Ai 152 such that, for all mixed-strategy profiles α, we have that the sum of the utilities satisfies ui(α)+uii(α) = X ai∈Ai αi(ai)· (i, ai)+ X aii∈Aii αii(aii)· (ii, aii). Note that any constant-sum game is strategically zero sum as well. It is not immediately obvious that one can efficiently decide if a given game is strategically zero sum. For completeness, we give a characterization of classical strategically zero-sum games in terms of the rank of a simple matrix derived from the games payoffs, allowing us to efficiently decide if a given game is strategically zero sum and, if it is, to compute the labels (i, ai). Theorem 3.1. Consider a game G = A, u with Ai = {a1 i , . . . , ani i }. Let MG be the ni-by-nii matrix whose i, j th entry MG (i,j) satisfies log2 MG (i,j) = ui(ai i , aj ii) + uii(ai i , aj ii). Then the following are equivalent: (i) G is strategically zero sum; (ii) there exist labels (i, ai) for every player i ∈ {i,ii} and every pure strategy ai ∈ Ai such that, for all pure strategies a ∈ A, we have ui(a) + uii(a) = (i, ai) + (ii, aii); and (iii) rank(MG ) = 1. Proof Sketch. (i ⇒ ii) is immediate; every pure strategy is a trivially mixed strategy. For (ii ⇒ iii), let ci be the n-element column vector with jth component 2 (i,a j i ) ; then ci · cii T = MG . For (iii ⇒ i), if rank(MG ) = 1, then MG = u · vT . We can prove that G is strategically zero sum by choosing labels (i, aj i ) := log2 uj and (ii, aj ii) := log2 vj. 4. SOCRATIC GAMES WITH UNOBSERVABLE QUERIES We begin with Socratic games with unobservable queries, where a players choice of query is not revealed to her opponent. We give an efficient algorithm to solve unobservablequery Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds. Our algorithm is based upon the LP shown in Figure 1, whose feasible points are Nash equilibria for the game. The LP has polynomially many variables but exponentially many constraints. We give an efficient separation oracle for the LP, implying that the ellipsoid method [28, 38] yields an efficient algorithm. This approach extends the techniques of Koller and Megiddo [39] (see also [40]) to solve constant-sum games represented in extensive form. (Recall that their result does not directly apply in our case; even a Socratic game with constant-sum worlds is not a constant-sum classical game.) Lemma 4.1. Let G = A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ be an arbitrary unobservable-query Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds. Any feasible point for the LP in Figure 1 can be efficiently mapped to a Nash equilibrium for G, and any Nash equilibrium for G can be mapped to a feasible point for the program. Proof Sketch. We begin with a description of the correspondence between feasible points for the LP and Nash equilibria for G. First, suppose that strategy profile f = fquery , fresp forms a Nash equilibrium for G. Then the following setting for the LP variables is feasible: yi qi = fquery i (qi) xi ai,qi,w = Pr[ai ← fresp i (qi, qi(w))] · yi qi ρi = P w,q∈Q,a∈A p(w) · xi ai,qi,w · xii aii,qii,w · [uw i (a) − δi(qi)]. (We omit the straightforward calculations that verify feasibility.) Next, suppose xi ai,qi,w, yi qi , ρi is feasible for the LP. Let f be the strategy-function profile defined as fquery i : qi → yi qi fresp i (qi, qi(w)) : ai → xi ai,qi,w/yi qi . Verifying that this strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium requires checking that fresp i (qi, qi(w)) is a well-defined function (from constraint VI), that fquery i and fresp i (qi, qi(w)) are probability distributions (from constraints III and IV), and that each player is playing a best response to his or her opponents strategy (from constraints I and II). Finally, from constraints I and II, the expected payoff to Player i is at most ρi. Because the right-hand side of constraint VII is equal to the expected sum of the payoffs from f and is at most ρi + ρii, the payoffs are correct and imply the lemma. We now give an efficient separation oracle for the LP in Figure 1, thus allowing the ellipsoid method to solve the LP in polynomial time. Recall that a separation oracle is a function that, given a setting for the variables in the LP, either returns feasible or returns a particular constraint of the LP that is violated by that setting of the variables. An efficient, correct separation oracle allows us to solve the LP efficiently via the ellipsoid method. Lemma 4.2. There exists a separation oracle for the LP in Figure 1 that is correct and runs in polynomial time. Proof. Here is a description of the separation oracle SP. On input xi ai,qi,w, yi qi , ρi : 1. Check each of the constraints (III), (IV), (V), (VI), and (VII). If any one of these constraints is violated, then return it. 2. Define the strategy profile f as follows: fquery i : qi → yi qi fresp i (qi, qi(w)) : ai → xi ai,qi,w/yi qi For each query qi, we will compute a pure best-response function ˆf qi i for Player I to strategy fii after making query qi. More specifically, given fii and the result qi(wreal) of the query qi, it is straightforward to compute the probability that, conditioned on the fact that the result of query qi is qi(w), the world is w and Player II will play action aii ∈ Aii. Therefore, for each query qi and response qi(w), Player I can compute the expected utility of each pure response ai to the induced mixed strategy over Aii for Player II. Player I can then select the ai maximizing this expected payoff. Let ˆfi be the response function such that ˆfi(qi, qi(w)) = ˆf qi i (qi(w)) for every qi ∈ Qi. Similarly, compute ˆfii. 153 Player i does not prefer make query qi, then play according to the function fi : ∀qi ∈ Qi, fi : Ri → Ai : ρi ≥ P w∈W,aii∈Aii,qii∈Qii,ai=fi(qi,qi(w)) ` p(w) · xii aii,qii,w · [uw i (a) − δi(qi)] ´ (I) ∀qii ∈ Qii, fii : Rii → Aii : ρii ≥ P w∈W,ai∈Ai,qi∈Qi,aii=fii(qii,qii(w)) ` p(w) · xi ai,qi,w · [uw ii (a) − δii(qii)] ´ (II) Every players choices form a probability distribution in every world: ∀i ∈ {i,ii}, w ∈ W : 1 = P ai∈Ai,qi∈Qi xi ai,qi,w (III) ∀i ∈ {i,ii}, w ∈ W : 0 ≤ xi ai,qi,w (IV) Queries are independent of the world, and actions depend only on query output: ∀i ∈ {i,ii}, qi ∈ Qi, w ∈ W, w ∈ W such that qi(w) = qi(w ) : yi qi = P ai∈Ai xi ai,qi,w (V) xi ai,qi,w = xi ai,qi,w (VI) The payoffs are consistent with the labels (i, ai, w): ρi + ρii = P i∈{i,ii} P w∈W,qi∈Qi,ai∈Ai ` p(w) · xi ai,qi,w · [ (i, ai, w) − δi(qi)] ´ (VII) Figure 1: An LP to find Nash equilibria in unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds. The input is a Socratic game A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ so that world w is strategically zero sum with labels (i, ai, w). Player i makes query qi ∈ Qi with probability yi qi and, when the actual world is w ∈ W, makes query qi and plays action ai with probability xi ai,qi,w. The expected payoff to Player i is given by ρi. 3. Let ˆρ qi i be the expected payoff to Player I using the strategy make query qi and play response function ˆfi if Player II plays according to fii. Let ˆρi = maxqi∈Qq ˆρ qi i and let ˆqi = arg maxqi∈Qq ˆρ qi i . Similarly, define ˆρ qii ii , ˆρii, and ˆqii. 4. For the ˆfi and ˆqi defined in Step 3, return constraint (I-ˆqi- ˆfi) or (II-ˆqii- ˆfii) if either is violated. If both are satisfied, then return feasible. We first note that the separation oracle runs in polynomial time and then prove its correctness. Steps 1 and 4 are clearly polynomial. For Step 2, we have described how to compute the relevant response functions by examining every action of Player I, every world, every query, and every action of Player II. There are only polynomially many queries, worlds, query results, and pure actions, so the running time of Steps 2 and 3 is thus polynomial. We now sketch the proof that the separation oracle works correctly. The main challenge is to show that if any constraint (I-qi-fi ) is violated then (I-ˆqi- ˆfi) is violated in Step 4. First, we observe that, by construction, the function ˆfi computed in Step 3 must be a best response to Player II playing fii, no matter what query Player I makes. Therefore the strategy make query ˆqi, then play response function ˆfi must be a best response to Player II playing fii, by definition of ˆqi. The right-hand side of each constraint (I-qi-fi ) is equal to the expected payoff that Player I receives when playing the pure strategy make query qi and then play response function fi against Player IIs strategy of fii. Therefore, because the pure strategy make query ˆqi and then play response function ˆfi is a best response to Player II playing fii, the right-hand side of constraint (I-ˆqi- ˆfi) is at least as large as the right hand side of any constraint (I-ˆqi-fi ). Therefore, if any constraint (I-qi-fi ) is violated, constraint (I-ˆqi- ˆfi) is also violated. An analogous argument holds for Player II. These lemmas and the well-known fact that Nash equilibria always exist [52] imply the following theorem: Theorem 4.3. Nash equilibria can be found in polynomial time for any two-player unobservable-query Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds. 5. SOCRATIC GAMES WITH OBSERVABLE QUERIES In this section, we give efficient algorithms to find (1) a Nash equilibrium for observable-query Socratic games with constant-sum worlds and (2) a correlated equilibrium in the broader class of Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds. Recall that a Socratic game G = A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ with observable queries proceeds in two stages: Stage 1: The players simultaneously choose queries q ∈ Q. Player i receives as output qi, qii, and qi(wreal). Stage 2: The players simultaneously choose strategies a ∈ A. The payoff to Player i is u wreal i (a) − δi(qi). Using backward induction, we first solve Stage 2 and then proceed to the Stage-1 game. For a query q ∈ Q, we would like to analyze the Stage-2 game ˆGq resulting from the players making queries q in Stage 1. Technically, however, ˆGq is not actually a game, because at the beginning of Stage 2 the players have different information about the world: Player I knows qi(wreal), and 154 Player II knows qii(wreal). Fortunately, the situation in which players have asymmetric private knowledge has been well studied in the game-theory literature. A Bayesian game is a quadruple A, T, r, u , where: • Ai is the set of pure strategies for Player i. • Ti is the set of types for Player i. • r is a probability distribution over T; r(t) denotes the probability that Player i has type ti for all i. • ui : A × T → R is the payoff function for Player i. If the players have types t and play pure strategies a, then ui(a, t) denotes the payoff for Player i. Initially, a type t is drawn randomly from T according to the distribution r. Player i learns his type ti, but does not learn any other players type. Player i then plays a mixed strategy αi ∈ Ai-that is, a probability distribution over Ai-and receives payoff ui(α, t). A strategy function is a function hi : Ti → Ai; Player i plays the mixed strategy hi(ti) ∈ Ai when her type is ti. A strategy-function profile h is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium if and only if no Player i has unilateral incentive to deviate from hi if the other players play according to h. For a two-player Bayesian game, if α = h(t), then the profile h is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium exactly when the following condition and its analogue for Player II hold: Et∼r[ui(α, t)] = maxhi Et∼r[ui( hi(ti), αii , t)]. These conditions hold if and only if, for all ti ∈ Ti occurring with positive probability, Player is expected utility conditioned on his type being ti is maximized by hi(ti). A Bayesian game is constant sum if for all a ∈ A and all t ∈ T, we have ui(a, t) + uii(a, t) = ct, for some constant ct independent of a. A Bayesian game is strategically zero sum if the classical game A, u(·, t) is strategically zero sum for every t ∈ T. Whether a Bayesian game is strategically zero sum can be determined as in Theorem 3.1. (For further discussion of Bayesian games, see [25, 31].) We now formally define the Stage-2 game as a Bayesian game. Given a Socratic game G = A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ and a query profile q ∈ Q, we define the Stage-2 Bayesian game Gstage2(q) := A, Tq , pstage2(q) , ustage2(q) , where: • Ai, the set of pure strategies for Player i, is the same as in the original Socratic game; • Tq i = {qi(w) : w ∈ W}, the set of types for Player i, is the set of signals that can result from query qi; • pstage2(q) (t) = Pr[q(w) = t | w ← p]; and • u stage2(q) i (a, t) = P w∈W Pr[w ← p | q(w) = t] · uw i (a). We now define the Stage-1 game in terms of the payoffs for the Stage-2 games. Fix any algorithm alg that finds a Bayesian Nash equilibrium hq,alg := alg(Gstage2(q)) for each Stage-2 game. Define valuealg i (Gstage2(q)) to be the expected payoff received by Player i in the Bayesian game Gstage2(q) if each player plays according to hq,alg , that is, valuealg i (Gstage2(q)) := P w∈W p(w) · u stage2(q) i (hq,alg (q(w)), q(w)). Define the game Galg stage1 := Astage1 , ustage1(alg) , where: • Astage1 := Q, the set of available queries in the Socratic game; and • u stage1(alg) i (q) := valuealg i (Gstage2(q)) − δi(qi). I.e., players choose queries q and receive payoffs corresponding to valuealg (Gstage2(q)), less query costs. Lemma 5.1. Consider an observable-query Socratic game G = A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ . Let Gstage2(q) be the Stage-2 games for all q ∈ Q, let alg be an algorithm finding a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in each Gstage2(q), and let Galg stage1 be the Stage-1 game. Let α be a Nash equilibrium for Galg stage1, and let hq,alg := alg(Gstage2(q)) be a Bayesian Nash equilibrium for each Gstage2(q). Then the following strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium for G: • In Stage 1, Player i makes query qi with probability αi(qi). (That is, set fquery (q) := α(q).) • In Stage 2, if q is the query in Stage 1 and qi(wreal) denotes the response to Player is query, then Player i chooses action ai with probability hq,alg i (qi(wreal)). (In other words, set fresp i (q, qi(w)) := hq,alg i (qi(w)).) We now find equilibria in the stage games for Socratic games with constant- or strategically zero-sum worlds. We first show that the stage games are well structured in this setting: Lemma 5.2. Consider an observable-query Socratic game G = A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ with constant-sum worlds. Then the Stage-1 game Galg stage1 is strategically zero sum for every algorithm alg, and every Stage-2 game Gstage2(q) is Bayesian constant sum. If the worlds of G are strategically zero sum, then every Gstage2(q) is Bayesian strategically zero sum. We now show that we can efficiently compute equilibria for these well-structured stage games. Theorem 5.3. There exists a polynomial-time algorithm BNE finding Bayesian Nash equilibria in strategically zerosum Bayesian (and thus classical strategically zero-sum or Bayesian constant-sum) two-player games. Proof Sketch. Let G = A, T, r, u be a strategically zero-sum Bayesian game. Define an unobservable-query Socratic game G∗ with one possible world for each t ∈ T, one available zero-cost query qi for each Player i so that qi reveals ti, and all else as in G. Bayesian Nash equilibria in G correspond directly to Nash equilibria in G∗ , and the worlds of G∗ are strategically zero sum. Thus by Theorem 4.3 we can compute Nash equilibria for G∗ , and thus we can compute Bayesian Nash equilibria for G. (LPs for zero-sum two-player Bayesian games have been previously developed and studied [61].) Theorem 5.4. We can compute a Nash equilibrium for an arbitrary two-player observable-query Socratic game G = A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ with constant-sum worlds in polynomial time. Proof. Because each world of G is constant sum, Lemma 5.2 implies that the induced Stage-2 games Gstage2(q) are all Bayesian constant sum. Thus we can use algorithm BNE to compute a Bayesian Nash equilibrium hq,BNE := BNE(Gstage2(q)) for each q ∈ Q, by Theorem 5.3. Furthermore, again by Lemma 5.2, the induced Stage-1 game GBNE stage1 is classical strategically zero sum. Therefore we can again use algorithm BNE to compute a Nash equilibrium α := BNE(GBNE stage1), again by Theorem 5.3. Therefore, by Lemma 5.1, we can assemble α and the hq,BNE s into a Nash equilibrium for the Socratic game G. 155 We would like to extend our results on observable-query Socratic games to Socratic games with strategically zerosum worlds. While we can still find Nash equilibria in the Stage-2 games, the resulting Stage-1 game is not in general strategically zero sum. Thus, finding Nash equilibria in observable-query Socratic games with strategically zerosum worlds seems to require substantially new techniques. However, our techniques for decomposing observable-query Socratic games do allow us to find correlated equilibria in this case. Lemma 5.5. Consider an observable-query Socratic game G = A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ . Let alg be an arbitrary algorithm that finds a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in each of the derived Stage-2 games Gstage2(q), and let Galg stage1 be the derived Stage1 game. Let φ be a correlated equilibrium for Galg stage1, and let hq,alg := alg(Gstage2(q)) be a Bayesian Nash equilibrium for each Gstage2(q). Then the following distribution over pure strategies is a correlated equilibrium for G: ψ(q, f) := φ(q) Y i∈{i,ii} Y s∈S Pr h fi(q, s) ← hq,alg i (s) i . Thus to find a correlated equilibrium in an observable-query Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds, we need only algorithm BNE from Theorem 5.3 along with an efficient algorithm for finding a correlated equilibrium in a general game. Such an algorithm exists (the definition of correlated equilibria can be directly translated into an LP [3]), and therefore we have the following theorem: Theorem 5.6. We can provide both efficient oracle access and efficient sampling access to a correlated equilibrium for any observable-query two-player Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds. Because the support of the correlated equilibrium may be exponentially large, providing oracle and sampling access is the natural way to represent the correlated equilibrium. By Lemma 5.5, we can also compute correlated equilibria in any observable-query Socratic game for which Nash equilibria are computable in the induced Gstage2(q) games (e.g., when Gstage2(q) is of constant size). Another potentially interesting model of queries in Socratic games is what one might call public queries, in which both the choice and outcome of a players query is observable by all players in the game. (This model might be most appropriate in the presence of corporate espionage or media leaks, or in a setting in which the queries-and thus their results-are done in plain view.) The techniques that we have developed in this section also yield exactly the same results as for observable queries. The proof is actually simpler: with public queries, the players payoffs are common knowledge when Stage 2 begins, and thus Stage 2 really is a complete-information game. (There may still be uncertainty about the real world, but all players use the observed signals to infer exactly the same set of possible worlds in which wreal may lie; thus they are playing a complete-information game against each other.) Thus we have the same results as in Theorems 5.4 and 5.6 more simply, by solving Stage 2 using a (non-Bayesian) Nash-equilibrium finder and solving Stage 1 as before. Our results for observable queries are weaker than for unobservable: in Socratic games with worlds that are strategically zero sum but not constant sum, we find only a correlated equilibrium in the observable case, whereas we find a Nash equilibrium in the unobservable case. We might hope to extend our unobservable-query techniques to observable queries, but there is no obvious way to do so. The fundamental obstacle is that the LPs payoff constraint becomes nonlinear if there is any dependence on the probability that the other player made a particular query. This dependence arises with observable queries, suggesting that observable Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds may be harder to solve. 6. RELATED WORK Our work was initially motivated by research in the social sciences indicating that real people seem (irrationally) paralyzed when they are presented with additional options. In this section, we briefly review some of these social-science experiments and then discuss technical approaches related to Socratic game theory. Prima facie, a rational agents happiness given an added option can only increase. However, recent research has found that more choices tend to decrease happiness: for example, students choosing among extra-credit options are more likely to do extra credit if given a small subset of the choices and, moreover, produce higher-quality work [35]. (See also [19].) The psychology literature explores a number of explanations: people may miscalculate their opportunity cost by comparing their choice to a component-wise maximum of all other options instead of the single best alternative [65], a new option may draw undue attention to aspects of the other options [67], and so on. The present work explores an economic explanation of this phenomenon: information is not free. When there are more options, a decision-maker must spend more time to achieve a satisfactory outcome. See, e.g., the work of Skyrms [68] for a philosophical perspective on the role of deliberation in strategic situations. Finally, we note the connection between Socratic games and modal logic [34], a formalism for the logic of possibility and necessity. The observation that human players typically do not play rational strategies has inspired some attempts to model partially rational players. The typical model of this socalled bounded rationality [36, 64, 66] is to postulate bounds on computational power in computing the consequences of a strategy. The work on bounded rationality [23, 24, 53, 58] differs from the models that we consider here in that instead of putting hard limitations on the computational power of the agents, we instead restrict their a priori knowledge of the state of the world, requiring them to spend time (and therefore money/utility) to learn about it. Partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) are a general framework used in AI to model situations of multi-agent planning in an evolving, unknown environment, but the generality of POSGs seems to make them very difficult [6]. Recent work has been done in developing algorithms for restricted classes of POSGs, most notably classes of cooperative POSGs-e.g., [20, 30]-which are very different from the competitive strategically zero-sum games we address in this paper. The fundamental question in Socratic games is deciding on the comparative value of making a more costly but more informative query, or concluding the data-gathering phase and picking the best option, given current information. This tradeoff has been explored in a variety of other contexts; a sampling of these contexts includes aggregating results 156 from delay-prone information sources [8], doing approximate reasoning in intelligent systems [72], deciding when to take the current best guess of disease diagnosis from a beliefpropagation network and when to let it continue inference [33], among many others. This issue can also be viewed as another perspective on the general question of exploration versus exploitation that arises often in AI: when is it better to actively seek additional information instead of exploiting the knowledge one already has? (See, e.g., [69].) Most of this work differs significantly from our own in that it considers single-agent planning as opposed to the game-theoretic setting. A notable exception is the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44] on mechanism design for interacting agents whose computation is costly and limited. They present a model in which players must solve a computationally intractable valuation problem, using costly computation to learn some hidden parameters, and results for auctions and bargaining games in this model. 7. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Efficiently finding Nash equilibria in Socratic games with non-strategically zero-sum worlds is probably difficult because the existence of such an algorithm for classical games has been shown to be unlikely [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55]. There has, however, been some algorithmic success in finding Nash equilibria in restricted classical settings (e.g., [21, 46, 47, 57]); we might hope to extend our results to analogous Socratic games. An efficient algorithm to find correlated equilibria in general Socratic games seems more attainable. Suppose the players receive recommended queries and responses. The difficulty is that when a player considers a deviation from his recommended query, he already knows his recommended response in each of the Stage-2 games. In a correlated equilibrium, a players expected payoff generally depends on his recommended strategy, and thus a player may deviate in Stage 1 so as to land in a Stage-2 game where he has been given a better than average recommended response. (Socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type, so Papadimitrious results [56] do not imply correlated equilibria for them.) Socratic games can be extended to allow players to make adaptive queries, choosing subsequent queries based on previous results. Our techniques carry over to O(1) rounds of unobservable queries, but it would be interesting to compute equilibria in Socratic games with adaptive observable queries or with ω(1) rounds of unobservable queries. Special cases of adaptive Socratic games are closely related to single-agent problems like minimum latency [1, 7, 26], determining strategies for using priced information [9, 29, 37], and an online version of minimum test cover [18, 50]. Although there are important technical distinctions between adaptive Socratic games and these problems, approximation techniques from this literature may apply to Socratic games. The question of approximation raises interesting questions even in non-adaptive Socratic games. An -approximate Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile α so that no player can increase her payoff by an additive by deviating from α. Finding approximate Nash equilibria in both adaptive and non-adaptive Socratic games is an interesting direction to pursue. Another natural extension is the model where query results are stochastic. In this paper, we model a query as deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into subsets that the query cannot distinguish. However, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals. With this modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds. Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world. It is also interesting to consider settings in which the games queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions. (For example, one might consider a setting in which the algorithm has only a sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki.) Efficiently finding equilibria in such settings remains an open problem. Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries. Here we take the query cost to be a linear function, so that δ(q) = P γ∈q δ({γ}). Natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my opponent is playing strategy aii, would I prefer to play ai or ˆai?), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if I play strategy ai?), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ W the real world?). When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions. (For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.) Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy. Thus even computing a best response for Player I is hard. (This proof proceeds by reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, Player I must fully identify the actual world through his queries. Selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries is hard.) Computing Player Is best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14]. An interesting open question is whether this approximate best-response calculation can be leveraged to find an approximate Nash equilibrium. 8.

Sin embargo, en la vida real, las personas a menudo desconocen la utilidad de tomar una acción particular hasta que realizan investigaciones sobre sus consecuencias. En este artículo, modelamos este fenómeno. Imaginamos que un jugador participó en una sesión de preguntas y respuestas, haciendo preguntas tanto sobre sus propias preferencias como sobre el estado de la realidad;Por lo tanto, llamamos a esta configuración de teoría de juegos socráticos. En un juego socrático, los jugadores comienzan con una distribución de probabilidad a priori en muchos mundos posibles, con una función de utilidad diferente para cada mundo. Los jugadores pueden hacer consultas, a cierto costo, para aprender información parcial sobre cuál de los mundos posibles es el mundo real, antes de elegir una acción. Consideramos dos modelos de consulta: (1) un modelo de Quera No Observable, en el que los jugadores aprenden solo la respuesta a sus propias consultas, y (2) un modelo observable, en el que los jugadores también aprenden qué consultas hicieron sus oponentes. Los resultados en este documento consideran casos en los que los mundos subyacentes de un juego socrático de dos jugadores son juegos de suma constante o juegos estratégicamente de suma cero, una clase que generaliza los juegos de suma constante para incluir todos los juegos en los que la suma de los pagosDepende linealmente de la interacción entre los jugadores. Cuando los mundos subyacentes son una suma constante, damos algoritmos de tiempo polinomial para encontrar equilibrios NASH en los modelos observables y no observables. Cuando los mundos son estratégicamente cero suma, damos algoritmos eficientes para encontrar equilibrios de Nash en juegos socráticos no observables y equilibrios correlacionados en juegos socráticos observables.

Introducción a fines de octubre de 1960. Una habitación ahumada. Los estrategas del Partido Demócrata se acurrucan en un mapa. ¿Cómo debería la campaña Kennedy asignar su presupuesto de publicidad restante? ¿Debería centrarse en, por ejemplo, California o Nueva York? La campaña de Nixon enfrenta el mismo dilema. Por supuesto, ninguna campaña conoce la efectividad de su publicidad en cada estado. Quizás los californianos son susceptibles a la publicidad de Nixons, pero no responden a Kennedys. A la luz de esta incertidumbre, la campaña de Kennedy puede realizar una encuesta, a cierta costo, para estimar la efectividad de su publicidad. Además, cuanto más grande y más costosa, la encuesta, más precisa será. ¿Vale la pena el costo de una encuesta la información que proporciona? ¿Cómo se debe equilibrar el costo de adquirir más información contra el riesgo de jugar un juego con mayor incertidumbre? En este artículo, modelamos situaciones de este tipo como juegos socráticos. Como en la teoría de juegos tradicionales, los jugadores en un juego socrático eligen acciones para maximizar sus pagos, pero modelamos a los jugadores con información incompleta que pueden hacer consultas costosas para reducir su incertidumbre sobre el estado del mundo antes de elegir sus acciones. Este enfoque contrasta con la teoría del juego tradicional, en la que los jugadores generalmente se modelan como una información fija y exógena sobre la estructura del juego y sus pagos.(En juegos tradicionales de información incompleta e imperfecta, hay información que los jugadores no tienen; en los juegos socráticos, a diferencia de estos juegos, los jugadores tienen la oportunidad de adquirir la información faltante, a cierta costo). Varios modelos relacionados han sido explorados por economistas y científicos informáticos motivados por situaciones similares, a menudo con un enfoque en el diseño y las subastas de mecanismos;Una muestra de esta investigación incluye el trabajo de Larson y Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44], Parkes [59], Fong [22], Compte y Jehiel [12], Rezende [63], Persico y Matthews [48,60], Cr´emer y Khalil [15], Rasmusen [62] y Bergemann y V¨alim¨aki [4, 5]. El modelo de Bergemann y V¨alim¨aki es similar en muchos aspectos al que exploramos aquí;Consulte la Sección 7 para una discusión. Un juego socrático procede de la siguiente manera. Un mundo real es CHO150 sen al azar de un conjunto de mundos posibles según una distribución previa común. Luego, cada jugador selecciona una consulta arbitraria de un conjunto de consultas costosas disponibles y recibe una información correspondiente sobre el mundo real. Finalmente, cada jugador selecciona una acción y recibe una función de pago, una función de las acciones seleccionadas de los jugadores y la identidad del mundo real, el costo de la consulta que él o ella hizo. En comparación con la teoría de juegos tradicional, la característica distintiva de nuestro modelo es la introducción de costos explícitos para los jugadores para aprender información parcial arbitraria sobre cuál de los muchos mundos posibles es el mundo real. Inicialmente, nuestra investigación se inspiró en resultados recientes en psicología sobre la toma de decisiones, pero pronto quedó claro que la teoría de los juegos socráticos también es una herramienta general para comprender la compensación de explotación versus la exploración, bien estudiada en el aprendizaje automático, en un entorno multijugador estratégico. Esta tensión entre el riesgo derivado de la incertidumbre y el costo de adquirir información es ubicua en economía, ciencias políticas y más allá. Nuestros resultados. Consideramos los juegos socráticos bajo dos modelos: un modelo de Quera No Observable donde los jugadores aprenden solo la respuesta a sus propias consultas y un modelo de Quera Observable donde los jugadores también aprenden qué consultas hicieron sus oponentes. Damos algoritmos eficientes para encontrar el equilibrio de Nash. Nuestro primer resultado es un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar equilibrios de NASH en juegos socráticos no obstinados con mundos de suma constante, en los que la suma de los pagos de los jugadores es independiente de sus acciones. Nuestras técnicas también producen equilibrios NASH en juegos socráticos no observables con mundos estratégicamente de suma cero. Los juegos estratégicamente de suma cero generalizan los juegos de suma constante al permitir que la suma de los pagos de los jugadores dependa de las elecciones de estrategia de jugadores individuales, pero no de ninguna interacción de sus elecciones. Nuestro segundo resultado es un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar equilibrios de Nash en juegos socráticos de cuidia observable con mundos de suma constante. Finalmente, damos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar equilibrios correlacionados, un concepto de solución más débil pero cada vez más bien estudiado para juegos [2, 3, 32, 56, 57], en juegos socráticos observables con mundos estratégicamente cero cero. Al igual que todos los juegos, los juegos socráticos se pueden ver como un caso especial de juegos de forma extensa, que representan juegos por árboles en los que los nodos internos representan opciones tomadas por casualidad o por los jugadores, y las hojas representan resultados que corresponden a un vector de pagosa los jugadores. Algorítmicamente, la generalidad de los juegos de forma extensa hace que sean difíciles de resolver de manera eficiente, y los casos especiales que se sabe que son eficientemente solucionables no incluyen incluso juegos socráticos simples. Cada juego clásico (información completa) es un juego socrático trivial (con un solo mundo posible y una sola consulta trivial), y se ha demostrado que encontrar equilibrios de Nash en los juegos clásicos es difícil [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 17, 17, 27, 54, 55]. Por lo tanto, no esperaríamos encontrar un algoritmo sencillo de tiempo polinomial para calcular los equilibrios de Nash en los juegos socráticos generales. Sin embargo, es bien sabido que los equilibrios NASH se pueden encontrar de manera eficiente a través de un LP para juegos de suma constante de dos jugadores [49, 71] (y juegos estratégicamente de suma cero [51]). Un juego socrático es en sí mismo un juego clásico, por lo que uno podría esperar que estos resultados puedan aplicarse a los juegos socráticos con mundos de suma constante (o estratégicamente cero de suma). Nos enfrentamos a dos obstáculos principales para extender estos resultados clásicos a los juegos socráticos. Primero, un juego socrático con mundos de suma constante no es en sí mismo un juego clásico de suma constante, el juego clásico resultante es solo una suma estratégicamente cero. Peor aún, un juego socrático con mundos estratégicamente de suma cero no es en sí misma clásicamente estratégicamente estratégicamente cero, no se conocen técnicas algorítmicas eficientes para calcular los equilibrios de Nash en la clase resultante de juegos clásicos.(Los algoritmos de tiempo exponencial como Lemke/Howson, por supuesto, se pueden usar [45]). Por lo tanto, incluso cuando es fácil encontrar equilibrios de Nash en cada uno de los mundos de un juego socrático, requerimos nuevas técnicas para resolver el juego socrático en sí. En segundo lugar, incluso cuando el juego socrático en sí es estratégicamente cero suma, el número de estrategias posibles disponibles para cada jugador es exponencial en la representación natural del juego. Como resultado, los programas lineales estándar para calcular los equilibrios tienen un número exponencial de variables y un número exponencial de restricciones. Para los juegos socráticos no observables con mundos estratégicamente cero de suma, abordamos estos obstáculos formulando un nuevo LP que usa solo muchas variables polinómicamente (aunque sigue siendo un número exponencial de restricciones) y luego usamos técnicas basadas en elipsoide para resolverlo. Para los juegos socráticos observables, manejamos la exponencialidad descomponiendo el juego en etapas, resolviendo las etapas por separado y mostrando cómo reensamblar las soluciones de manera eficiente. Para resolver las etapas, es necesario encontrar equilibrios de Nash en los juegos de suma de cero bayesiano, y damos un algoritmo explícito de tiempo polinómico para hacerlo.2. Juegos y juegos socráticos En esta sección, revisamos antecedentes sobre la teoría de juegos e presentamos formalmente juegos socráticos. Presentamos estos modelos en el contexto de los juegos de dos jugadores, pero el caso multijugador es una extensión natural. A lo largo del documento, se utilizarán variables en negrita para denotar un par de variables (por ejemplo, a = ai, aii). Deje que PR [x ← π] denote la probabilidad de que un valor particular x se extraiga de la distribución π, y deje Ex∼π [g (x)] denota la expectativa de g (x) cuando x se extrae de π.2.1 Antecedentes sobre la teoría del juego Considere a dos jugadores, el jugador I y el jugador II, cada uno de los cuales intenta maximizar su utilidad (o recompensa). Un juego (de dos jugadores) es un par A, u, donde, porque i ∈ {i, ii}, • ai es el conjunto de estrategias puras para el jugador I, y a = ai, aii;y • UI: A → R es la función de utilidad para el jugador I, y u = ui, uii. Requerimos que A y usted sean conocimiento común. Si cada jugador yo elige la estrategia ai ∈ Ai, entonces los pagos a los jugadores I y II son UI (A) y UII (A), respectivamente. Un juego es una suma constante si, para todos a ∈ A, tenemos ese ui (a) + uii (a) = c para una c fija independiente de a. Jugador También puedo jugar una estrategia mixta αi ∈ Ai, donde AI denota el espacio de medidas de probabilidad sobre el conjunto AI. Las funciones de pago se generalizan como ui (α) = ui (αi, αii): = ea∼α [ui (a)] = p a∈A α (a) ui (a), donde la cantidad α (a) = 151αi (ai) · αii (aii) denota la probabilidad conjunta de los eventos independientes que cada jugador i elige la acción ai de la distribución αi. Esta generalización a estrategias mixtas se conoce como Von Neumann/Morgenstern Utility [70], en la que los jugadores son indiferentes entre una recompensa garantizada X y una recompensa esperada de X. Un equilibrio de Nash es un par α de estrategias mixtas para que ninguno de los jugadores tenga un incentivo para cambiar su estrategia de manera unilateral. Formalmente, el par de estrategias α es un equilibrio NASH si y solo si ambos UI (αi, αii) = maxαi∈Ai UI (αi, αii) y UII (αi, αii) = maxαii∈Aii uii (αi, αii);Es decir, las estrategias αi y αII son las mejores respuestas mutuas. Un equilibrio correlacionado es una distribución ψ sobre A que obedece lo siguiente: si a ∈ A se dibuja al azar de acuerdo con ψ y el jugador, aprende IA, entonces ningún jugador tengo incentivo para desviar unilateralmente de jugar ai.(Un equilibrio de Nash es un equilibrio correlacionado en el que ψ (a) = αi (ai) · αii (aii) es una distribución de productos). Formalmente, en un equilibrio correlacionado, por cada a ∈ A debemos tener que Ai es una mejor respuesta a un ˆaii ˆaii ∈ AII dibujado de acuerdo con ψ (ai, ˆaii), y la condición análoga debe competir para el jugador II.2.2 Juegos socráticos En esta sección, definimos formalmente juegos socráticos. Un juego socrático es un 7-Tuple A, W, U, S, Q, P, δ, donde, para i ∈ {i, II}: • Ai es, como antes, el conjunto de estrategias puras para el jugador i.• W es un conjunto de posibles mundos, uno de los cuales es el mundo real.• ui = {uw i: a → r |w ∈ W} es un conjunto de funciones de pago para el Jugador I, una para cada mundo posible.• S es un conjunto de señales.• Qi es un conjunto de consultas disponibles para el jugador i. Cuando el jugador hace la consulta Qi: W → S, él o ella recibe la señal Qi (Wreal). Cuando el jugador I recibe la señal Qi (Wreal) en respuesta a la consulta Qi, él o ella puede inferir que Wreal ∈ {w: qi (w) = qi (wreal)}, es decir, el conjunto de mundos posibles de los cuales la consulta Qi no puede distinguirWreal.• P: W → [0, 1] es una distribución de probabilidad sobre los posibles mundos.• ΔI: Qi → R≥0 da el costo de consulta para cada consulta disponible para el jugador i. Inicialmente, el mundo Wreal se elige de acuerdo con la distribución de probabilidad P, pero la identidad de Wreal sigue siendo desconocida para los jugadores. Es decir, es como si los jugadores estuvieran jugando el juego A, Uwreal pero no conocen Wreal. Los jugadores hacen consultas q ∈ Q, y el jugador I recibe la señal Qi (Wreal). Consideramos consultas observables y consultas no observables. Cuando se observan consultas, cada jugador aprende qué consulta fue realizada por el otro jugador, y los resultados de su propia consulta, es decir, cada jugador que aprende Qi, Qii y Qi (Wreal). Para consultas inobservables, el jugador I solo aprende Qi y Qi (Wreal). Después de aprender los resultados de las consultas, los jugadores seleccionan estrategias a ∈ A y reciben como pagos U weal i (a) - Δi (qi). En el juego socrático, una estrategia pura para el jugador I consiste en una consulta qi ∈ Qi y una función de respuesta mapeando cualquier resultado de la consulta Qi a una estrategia ai ∈ Ai para jugar. Un estado de conocimiento de los jugadores después de una consulta es un punto en r: = q × s o ri: = qi × s para consultas observables o no observables, respectivamente. Por lo tanto, el jugador es los mapas de la función de respuesta R o RI a AI. Tenga en cuenta que el número de estrategias puras es exponencial, ya que hay exponencialmente muchas funciones de respuesta. Una estrategia mixta implica la elección aleatoria de una consulta qi ∈ Qi y elegir aleatoriamente una acción ai ∈ Ai en respuesta a los resultados de la consulta. Formalmente, consideraremos un perfil de función de estrategia mixta f = fQuery, Freesp para tener dos partes: • Una función FQuery I: Qi → [0, 1], donde FQuery I (Qi) es la probabilidad de que el jugador haga la consultaQi.• Una función FRESP I que mapea R o RI a una distribución de probabilidad sobre las acciones. Jugador I Elige una acción ai ∈ Ai de acuerdo con la distribución de probabilidad FRESP I (Q, Qi (W)) para consultas observables, y de acuerdo con FRESP I (Qi, Qi (W)) para consultas no observables.(Con consultas no observables, por ejemplo, la probabilidad de que el jugador I juegue acción ai condicionado a hacer consultas Qi en el mundo w viene dada por pr [ai ← fresp i (qi, qi (w))].). Las estrategias mixtas generalmente se definen como distribuciones de probabilidad sobre las estrategias puras, pero aquí representamos una estrategia mixta por un par FQuery, FRESP, que comúnmente se conoce como una estrategia conductual en la literatura de teoría del juego. Como en cualquier juego con un retiro perfecto, se puede mapear fácilmente una mezcla de estrategias puras a una estrategia de comportamiento F = FQuery, FRESP que induce la misma probabilidad de hacer una consulta particular Qi o jugar una acción particular después de hacer una consulta Qi en un particularmundo. Por lo tanto, es suficiente considerar solo esta representación de estrategias mixtas. Para un perfil de función de estrategia F para consultas observables, la recompensa (esperada) al Jugador I está dada por x Q∈Q, W∈W, A∈A 2 6 6 4 FQuery I (Qi) · FQuery II (Qii) ·P (W) · PR [Ai ← Fresp I (Q, Qi (W))] · PR [AII ← Fresp II (Q, Qii (W))] · (UW I (A) - ΔI (Qi)) 37 7 5. Los pagos para consultas no observables son análogos, con Freesp J (QJ, QJ (W)) en lugar de FRESP J (Q, QJ (W)).3. Juegos estratégicamente de suma cero podemos ver un juego socrático G con mundos de suma constante como un juego clásico exponencialmente grande, con estrategias puras que consulta Qi y responde según FI. Sin embargo, este juego clásico no es una suma constante. La suma de los pagos de los jugadores varía según sus estrategias, porque diferentes consultas incurren en diferentes costos. Sin embargo, este juego todavía tiene una estructura significativa: la suma de los pagos varía solo debido a diferentes costos de consulta. Por lo tanto, la suma de los pagos depende de la elección de las estrategias de los jugadores, pero no de la interacción de sus elecciones, es decir, para las funciones fijas GI y GII, tenemos UI (Q, F) + UII (Q, F) = GI (Qi (Qi, fi) + gii (qii, fii) para todas las estrategias q, f. Tales juegos se denominan suma estratégicamente cero y fueron introducidos por Moulin y Vial [51], quienes describen una noción de equivalencia estratégica y definen los juegos estratégicamente de suma cero como aquellos estratégicamente equivalentes a los juegos de suma cero. Es interesante observar que dos juegos socráticos con las mismas consultas y mundos estratégicamente equivalentes no son necesariamente estratégicamente equivalentes. Un juego A, U es estratégicamente cero suma si existen etiquetas (i, ai) para cada jugador i y cada estrategia pura ai ∈ Ai 152 de tal manera que, para todos los perfiles de estrategia mixta α, tenemos que la suma de las utilidades satisfaceui (α)+ uii (α) = x ai∈Ai αi (ai) · (i, ai)+ x aii∈Aii αii (aii) · (ii, aii). Tenga en cuenta que cualquier juego de suma constante también es una suma estratégicamente cero. No es inmediatamente obvio que uno puede decidir eficientemente si un juego determinado es estratégicamente una suma cero. Para la integridad, damos una caracterización de los juegos clásicos estratégicamente de suma cero en términos del rango de una matriz simple derivada de los pagos de los juegos, lo que nos permite decidir eficientemente si un juego determinado es estratégicamente una suma cero y, si es así, para calcularLas etiquetas (i, ai). Teorema 3.1. Considere un juego g = a, u con ai = {a1 i ,..., ani i}. Deje que Mg sea la matriz Ni-by-niiy cuya I, J th Entry Mg (I, J) satisface log2 mg (i, j) = ui (ai i, aj ii) + uii (ai i i, aj II). Entonces los siguientes son equivalentes: (i) G es estratégicamente suma cero;(ii) Existen etiquetas (i, ai) para cada jugador i ∈ {i, ii} y cada estrategia pura ai ∈ Ai tal que, para todas las estrategias puras a ∈ A, tenemos ui (a) + uii (a)= (i, ai) + (ii, aii);y (iii) rango (mg) = 1. Boceto de prueba.(i ⇒ ii) es inmediato;Cada estrategia pura es una estrategia trivialmente mixta. Para (II ⇒ III), deje que CI sea el vector de la columna de elementos N con el componente JTH 2 (i, A J I);Entonces ci · cii t = mg. Para (iii ⇒ i), si rango (mg) = 1, entonces mg = u · vt. Podemos probar que G es estratégicamente una suma cero eligiendo etiquetas (i, aj I): = log2 uj y (ii, aj ii): = log2 vj.4. Juegos socráticos con consultas no observables, comenzamos con juegos socráticos con consultas no observables, donde la elección de la consulta de los jugadores no se revela a su oponente. Damos un algoritmo eficiente para resolver juegos socráticos no observables con mundos estratégicamente cero de suma. Nuestro algoritmo se basa en el LP que se muestra en la Figura 1, cuyos puntos factibles son equilibrios Nash para el juego. El LP tiene muchas variables polinomial pero exponencialmente muchas restricciones. Damos un oráculo de separación eficiente para el LP, lo que implica que el método elipsoide [28, 38] produce un algoritmo eficiente. Este enfoque extiende las técnicas de Koller y Megiddo [39] (ver también [40]) para resolver juegos de suma constante representados en una forma extensa.(Recuerde que su resultado no se aplica directamente en nuestro caso; incluso un juego socrático con mundos de suma constante no es un juego clásico de suma constante). Lema 4.1. Deje que G = A, W, U, S, Q, P, δ sea un juego socrático arbitrario no observable con mundos estratégicamente de suma cero. Cualquier punto factible para el LP en la Figura 1 se puede asignar de manera eficiente a un equilibrio de Nash para G, y cualquier equilibrio de Nash para G puede mapear a un punto factible para el programa. Boceto de prueba. Comenzamos con una descripción de la correspondencia entre puntos factibles para los equilibrios LP y NASH para G. Primero, supongamos que el perfil de estrategia F = FQuery, FRESP forma un equilibrio NASH para G. Entonces la siguiente configuración para las variables LP es factible: yiqi = fquery i (qi) xi ai, qi, w = pr [ai ← fresp i (qi, qi (w))] · yi qi ρi = p w, q∈Q, a∈A p (w) · xiai, qi, w · xii aii, qii, w · [uw i (a) - Δi (qi)].(Omitimos los cálculos directos que verifican la viabilidad). Luego, supongamos que Xi Ai, Qi, W, Yi Qi, ρi es factible para el LP. Sea f el perfil de función de estrategia definido como fquería i: qi → yi qi freesp i (qi, qi (w)): ai → xi ai, qi, w/yi qi. Verificar que este perfil de estrategia es un equilibrio NASH requiere verificar que FRESP I (Qi, Qi (W)) es una función bien definida (de Restricción VI), que FQuery I y Freesp I (Qi, Qi (W)) son probabilidadDistribuciones (de las limitaciones III y IV), y que cada jugador está jugando una mejor respuesta a su estrategia de oponentes (de las limitaciones I y II). Finalmente, desde las limitaciones I y II, la recompensa esperada al Jugador I es como máximo ρi. Debido a que el lado derecho de la restricción VII es igual a la suma esperada de los pagos de F y es como máximo ρi + ρII, los pagos son correctos e implican el lema. Ahora damos un oráculo de separación eficiente para el LP en la Figura 1, lo que permite que el método elipsoide resuelva el LP en el tiempo polinomial. Recuerde que un oráculo de separación es una función que, dada una configuración para las variables en el LP, devuelve factible o devuelve una restricción particular del LP que se viola por esa configuración de las variables. Un Oracle de separación eficiente y correcto nos permite resolver el LP de manera eficiente a través del método elipsoide. Lema 4.2. Existe un oráculo de separación para el LP en la Figura 1 que es correcta y se ejecuta en tiempo polinomial. Prueba. Aquí hay una descripción de la separación Oracle sp. En entrada xi ai, qi, w, yi qi, ρi: 1. Verifique cada una de las restricciones (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) y (vii). Si se viola alguna de estas limitaciones, devuélvalo.2. Defina el perfil de estrategia F de la siguiente manera: FQuery I: Qi → Yi Qi Fresp I (Qi, Qi (W)): Ai → Xi Ai, Qi, W/Yi Qi para cada consulta Qi, calcularemos una mejor respuesta puraFunción ˆf Qi I para el Jugador I para la estrategia FII después de hacer la consulta Qi. Más específicamente, dado Fii y el resultado Qi (Wreal) de la consulta Qi, es sencillo calcular la probabilidad de que, condicionada al hecho de que el resultado de la consulta Qi es Qi (w), el mundo es W y el jugador II WillJugar acción aii ∈ AII. Por lo tanto, para cada consulta Qi y respuesta Qi (W), el jugador puedo calcular la utilidad esperada de cada IA de respuesta pura a la estrategia mixta inducida sobre AII para el Jugador II. Jugador puedo seleccionar la IA maximizando esta recompensa esperada. Sea ˆfi la función de respuesta tal que ˆfi (qi, qi (w)) = ˆf qi i (qi (w)) para cada qi ∈ Qi. Del mismo modo, calcule ˆFii.153 Jugador I No prefiere hacer Qi de consulta, luego jugar de acuerdo con la función fi: ∀qi ∈ Qi, fi: ri → ai: ρi ≥ p w∈W, aii∈Aii, qii∈Qii, ai = fi (qi,qi (w)) `p (w) · xii aii, qii, w · [uw i (a) - Δi (qi)] ´ (i) ∀qii ∈ Qii, fii: rii → aii: ρii ≥ p w∈W, ai∈Ai, qi∈Qi, aii = fii (qii, qii (w)) `p (w) · xi ai, qi, w · [uw ii (a) - ΔII (qii)] ´ (ii)Las elecciones de todos los jugadores forman una distribución de probabilidad en cada mundo: ∀i ∈ {i, ii}, w ∈ W: 1 = p ai∈Ai, qi∈Qi xi ai, qi, w (iii) ∀i ∈ {i, ii, ii, ii, ii}, w ∈ W: 0 ≤ xi ai, qi, w (iv) Las consultas son independientes del mundo, y las acciones dependen solo de la salida de consulta: ∀i ∈ {i, ii}, qi ∈ Qi, w ∈ W, w, w, w∈ W tal que qi (w) = qi (w): yi qi = p ai∈Ai xi ai, qi, w (v) xi ai, qi, w = xi ai, qi, w (vi) Los pagos son consistentescon las etiquetas (i, ai, w): ρi + ρii = p i∈ {i, ii} p w∈W, qi∈Qi, ai∈Ai `p (w) · xi ai, qi, w · [(((((((((((I, Ai, W)-ΔI (Qi)] ´ (vii) Figura 1: Un LP para encontrar equilibrios NASH en juegos socráticos no observables con mundos estratégicamente de suma cero. La entrada es un juego socrático A, W, U, S, Q, P, δ para que el mundo W sea estratégicamente cero suma con etiquetas (i, ai, w). Jugador I Hace Qi ∈ Qi con probabilidad Yi Qi y, cuando el mundo real es w ∈ W, hace Qi de consulta y juega acción ai con probabilidad xi ai, qi, w. La recompensa esperada al Jugador I es dado por ρi.3. Deje que ˆρ Qi sea la recompensa esperada para el jugador I usando la estrategia Hacer la función de consulta Qi y reproducir la función de respuesta ˆfi Si el jugador II juega de acuerdo con FII. Sea ˆρi = maxqi∈Qq ˆρ qi i y vamos ˆqi = arg maxqi∈Qq ˆρ qi i. Del mismo modo, defina ˆρ qii II, ˆρii y ˆqii.4. Para el ˆfi y ˆqi definido en el paso 3, la restricción de retorno (i-ˆqi- ˆfi) o (ii-ˆqii- ˆfii) si se viola. Si ambos están satisfechos, entonces regrese factible. Primero notamos que el oráculo de separación se ejecuta en tiempo polinomial y luego demostramos su corrección. Los pasos 1 y 4 son claramente polinomiales. Para el paso 2, hemos descrito cómo calcular las funciones de respuesta relevantes examinando cada acción del jugador I, cada mundo, cada consulta y cada acción del Jugador II. Solo hay muchas consultas, mundos, resultados de consultas y acciones puras, por lo que el tiempo de ejecución de los pasos 2 y 3 es, por lo tanto, polinomio. Ahora dibujamos la prueba de que el oráculo de separación funciona correctamente. El principal desafío es mostrar que si se viola alguna restricción (I-Qi-Fi) entonces (i-ˆqi- ˆfi) se viola en el paso 4. Primero, observamos que, por construcción, la función ˆFi calculada en el paso 3 debe ser una mejor respuesta al jugador II jugando fii, sin importar la consulta que haga el jugador. Por lo tanto, la estrategia hace consulta ˆqi, luego la función de respuesta de reproducción ˆfi debe ser una mejor respuesta al jugador II jugando fii, por definición de ˆqi. El lado derecho de cada restricción (I-Qi-Fi) es igual a la recompensa esperada que el jugador que recibe al jugar la estrategia pura hace que la consulta Qi y luego juegue la función de respuesta FI contra el jugador de la estrategia IIS de FII. Por lo tanto, debido a que la estrategia pura hace consulta ˆqi y luego la función de respuesta de reproducción ˆfi es una mejor respuesta al jugador II jugando fii, el lado derecho de la restricción (i-ˆqi- ˆfi) es al menos tan grande como el lado derecho deCualquier restricción (I-doc-Fi). Por lo tanto, si se viola alguna restricción (I-Qi-Fi), también se viola la restricción (i-ˆqi- ˆfi). Un argumento análogo es válido para el Jugador II. Estos lemas y el hecho conocido de que los equilibrios de Nash siempre existen [52] implican el siguiente teorema: Teorema 4.3. Los equilibrios NASH se pueden encontrar en el tiempo polinomial para cualquier juego socrático de dos jugadores no observable con mundos estratégicamente de suma cero.5. Juegos socráticos con consultas observables en esta sección, damos algoritmos eficientes para encontrar (1) un equilibrio NASH para juegos socráticos observables con cuero con mundos de suma constante y (2) un equilibrio correlacionado en la clase más amplia de juegos socráticos con cero estratégicamente cero-Mundos de suma. Recuerde que un juego socrático G = A, W, U, S, Q, P, δ con consultas observables procede en dos etapas: Etapa 1: Los jugadores eligen consultas simultáneamente q ∈ Q. Jugador I recibe como salida Qi, Qii y Qi (Wreal). Etapa 2: Los jugadores eligen simultáneamente estrategias a ∈ A. La recompensa al jugador I es U Weal I (A) - ΔI (Qi). Usando la inducción hacia atrás, primero resolvemos la etapa 2 y luego procedemos al juego de la Etapa 1. Para una consulta q ∈ Q, nos gustaría analizar el juego de la etapa-2 ˆGQ resultante de los jugadores que hacen consultas Q en la etapa 1. Técnicamente, sin embargo, ˆGQ no es en realidad un juego, porque al comienzo de la Etapa 2 los jugadores tienen información diferente sobre el mundo: el jugador I conoce Qi (Wreal), y 154 Jugador II conoce a Qii (Wreal). Afortunadamente, la situación en la que los jugadores tienen conocimiento privado asimétrico han sido bien estudiados en la literatura de teoría del juego. Un juego bayesiano es un cuádruple a, t, r, u, donde: • ai es el conjunto de estrategias puras para el jugador i.• Ti es el conjunto de tipos para el jugador i.• R es una distribución de probabilidad sobre t;R (t) denota la probabilidad de que el jugador I tenga tipo Ti para todos los i.• UI: A × T → R es la función de pago para el jugador i. Si los jugadores tienen tipos t y juegan estrategias puras A, entonces UI (A, T) denota la recompensa para el jugador i. Inicialmente, un tipo T se extrae al azar de T de acuerdo con la distribución r.Jugador Aprendo su tipo TI, pero no aprende ningún otro tipo de jugador. El jugador I luego juega una estrategia mixta αi ∈ AI-ESE, es una distribución de probabilidad sobre AI y recibe UI de pago (α, T). Una función de estrategia es una función HI: TI → AI;Jugador I juega la estrategia mixta HI (Ti) ∈ Ai cuando su tipo es ti. Un perfil de función de estrategia H es un equilibrio bayesiano de Nash si y solo si no tengo un jugador, tengo un incentivo unilateral para desviarse de HI si los otros jugadores juegan de acuerdo con h.Para un juego bayesiano de dos jugadores, si α = H (t), entonces el perfil H es un equilibrio de Nash bayesiano exactamente cuando la siguiente condición y su análogo para el jugador II Hold: et∼R [ui (α, t)] =Maxhi et∼R [ui (hi (ti), αii, t)]. Estas condiciones se mantienen si y solo si, para todas las ti ∈ Ti que ocurren con probabilidad positiva, se espera que el jugador sea una utilidad condicionada a su tipo que se maximiza por HI (TI). Un juego bayesiano es una suma constante si para todas a ∈ A y todo t ∈ T, tenemos ui (a, t) + uii (a, t) = ct, para una ct constante independiente de a. Un juego bayesiano es estratégicamente cero suma si el juego clásico A, U (·, t) es estratégicamente suma cero para cada t ∈ T. Si un juego bayesiano es estratégicamente una suma cero se puede determinar como en el Teorema 3.1.(Para una mayor discusión de los juegos bayesianos, ver [25, 31].). Ahora definimos formalmente el juego de la etapa 2 como un juego bayesiano. Dado un juego socrático G = A, W, U, S, Q, P, δ y un perfil de consulta q ∈ Q, definimos el juego bayesiano de la etapa 2 Gstage2 (Q): = a, tq, pstage2 (q),Ustage2 (Q), donde: • Ai, el conjunto de estrategias puras para el Jugador I, es el mismo que en el juego Socrático original;• tq i = {qi (w): w ∈ W}, el conjunto de tipos para el jugador I, es el conjunto de señales que pueden resultar de la consulta Qi;• pstage2 (q) (t) = pr [q (w) = t |w ← P];y • U Stage2 (Q) I (A, T) = P W∈W Pr [W ← P |q (w) = t] · uw i (a). Ahora definimos el juego de la Etapa 1 en términos de los pagos para los juegos de la etapa 2. Arregle cualquier algoritmo de algoritmo que encuentre una sede bayesiana de equilibrio Nash, ALG: = ALG (GSTAGE2 (Q)) para cada juego de etapa 2. Define Valuealg I (Gstage2 (Q)) como el recompensa esperado recibido por el jugador I en el juego bayesiano Gstage2 (Q) Si cada jugador juega de acuerdo con HQ, ALG, es decir, ValueAlg I (Gstage2 (Q)): = Pw∈W P (W) · U Stage2 (Q) I (HQ, ALG (Q (W)), Q (W)). Defina el juego Galg Stage1: = Astage1, Ustage1 (ALG), donde: • Astage1: = Q, el conjunto de consultas disponibles en el juego socrático;y • U Stage1 (ALG) I (Q): = ValueAlg I (Gstage2 (Q)) - ΔI (Qi). Es decir, los jugadores eligen consultas Q y reciben pagos correspondientes a Valuealg (GStage2 (Q)), menos costos de consulta. Lema 5.1. Considere un juego socrático de cuidia observable G = A, W, U, S, Q, P, δ. Deje que Gstage2 (Q) sea los juegos de la etapa 2 para todos Q ∈ Q, Sea ALG un algoritmo que encuentre un equilibrio bayesiano de Nash en cada GStage2 (Q), y deje que Galg Stage1 sea el juego de la Etapa 1. Deje que α sea un equilibrio NASH para Galg Stage1, y HQ, ALG: = ALG (GSTAGE2 (Q)) sea un equilibrio bayesiano de NASH para cada gstage2 (Q). Luego, el siguiente perfil de estrategia es un equilibrio de Nash para G: • En la etapa 1, el jugador I hace Qi de consulta con probabilidad αi (Qi).(Es decir, establecer fquery (q): = α (q).) • En la etapa 2, si Q es la consulta en la etapa 1 y Qi (Wreal) denota la respuesta al jugador es la consulta, entonces el jugador que elijo Action Ai conprobabilidad HQ, ALG I (Qi (Wreal)).(En otras palabras, establezca FRESP I (Q, Qi (W)): = HQ, ALG I (Qi (W)).). Ahora encontramos equilibrios en los juegos del escenario para juegos socráticos con mundos de suma constante o estratégicamente cero. Primero mostramos que los juegos del escenario están bien estructurados en este entorno: Lemma 5.2. Considere un juego socrático de cuidia observable G = A, W, U, S, Q, P, δ con mundos de suma constante. Luego, el juego de la etapa-1 Galg Stage1 es estratégicamente cero suma para cada alg de algoritmo, y cada juego de etapa 2 Gstage2 (Q) es una suma constante bayesiana. Si los mundos de G son estratégicamente cero suma, entonces cada Gstage2 (Q) es una suma bayesiana estratégicamente cero. Ahora mostramos que podemos calcular eficientemente los equilibrios para estos juegos escénicos bien estructurados. Teorema 5.3. Existe un algoritmo de tiempo polinómico que encuentra equilibrios de Nash bayesianos en los juegos de dos jugadores bayesianos estratégicamente Zerosum (y, por lo tanto, clásicos, estratégicamente cero o bayesianos). Boceto de prueba. Deje que G = A, T, R, usted sea un juego bayesiano estratégicamente cero. Definir un juego socrático G ∗ no observable con un mundo posible para cada t ∈ T, una consulta de costo cero disponible Qi para cada jugador i para que el Qi revele Ti, y todo lo demás como en G. Bayesian Nash Equilibria en g directamentea los equilibrios NASH en G ∗, y los mundos de G ∗ son estratégicamente suma cero. Por lo tanto, por el Teorema 4.3 podemos calcular los equilibrios de Nash para G ∗, y por lo tanto podemos calcular los equilibrios bayesianos de Nash para G. (LPS para juegos bayesianos de dos jugadores de suma cero se han desarrollado y estudiado previamente [61]). Teorema 5.4. Podemos calcular un equilibrio NASH para un juego socrático observable de dos jugadores arbitrario G = A, W, U, S, Q, P, δ con mundos de suma constante en el tiempo polinomial. Prueba. Debido a que cada mundo de G es una suma constante, Lemma 5.2 implica que los juegos inducidos en la etapa 2 Gstage2 (Q) son todas suma bayesiana constante. Por lo tanto, podemos usar el algoritmo bne para calcular un HQ de equilibrio Nash bayesiano, BNE: = BNE (Gstage2 (Q)) para cada q ∈ Q, por el teorema 5.3. Además, nuevamente por Lemma 5.2, el juego inducido por la etapa 1 GBNE Stage1 es una suma clásica estratégicamente cero. Por lo tanto, podemos volver a usar el algoritmo BNE para calcular un equilibrio NASH α: = BNE (GBNE Stage1), nuevamente por el Teorema 5.3. Por lo tanto, por Lemma 5.1, podemos ensamblar α y la sede, en un equilibrio NASH para el Juego Socrático G. 155 Nos gustaría extender nuestros resultados en juegos socráticos observables a juegos socráticos con mundos estratégicamente Zerosum. Si bien aún podemos encontrar equilibrios de Nash en los juegos de la etapa 2, el juego de la etapa 1 resultante no es en general estratégicamente una suma cero. Por lo tanto, encontrar equilibrios de Nash en juegos socráticos observables con mundos estratégicamente Zerosum parece requerir técnicas sustancialmente nuevas. Sin embargo, nuestras técnicas para descomponer los juegos socráticos observables para que nos permitan encontrar equilibrios correlacionados en este caso. Lema 5.5. Considere un juego socrático de cuidia observable G = A, W, U, S, Q, P, δ. Sea ALG un algoritmo arbitrario que encuentra un equilibrio bayesiano de Nash en cada uno de los juegos derivados de la etapa 2 Gstage2 (Q), y Sea Galg Stage1 sea el juego Derivado Stage1. Deje que φ sea un equilibrio correlacionado para Galg Stage1, y HQ, ALG: = ALG (GSTAGE2 (Q)) sea un equilibrio bayesiano de NASH para cada gstage2 (Q). Entonces, la siguiente distribución sobre estrategias puras es un equilibrio correlacionado para g: ψ (q, f): = φ (q) y i∈ {i, ii} y s∈S pr h fi (q, s) ← hq, algi (s) i. Por lo tanto, para encontrar un equilibrio correlacionado en un juego socrático observable con mundos estratégicamente cero de suma, solo necesitamos algoritmo BNE del Teorema 5.3 junto con un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar un equilibrio correlacionado en un juego general. Tal algoritmo existe (la definición de equilibrios correlacionados se puede traducir directamente a un LP [3]), y por lo tanto tenemos el siguiente teorema: Teorema 5.6. Podemos proporcionar acceso eficiente de Oracle y un acceso eficiente de muestreo a un equilibrio correlacionado para cualquier juego socrático de dos jugadores observable con mundos estratégicamente de suma cero. Debido a que el soporte del equilibrio correlacionado puede ser exponencialmente grande, proporcionar oráculo y acceso a muestreo es la forma natural de representar el equilibrio correlacionado. Por Lemma 5.5, también podemos calcular los equilibrios correlacionados en cualquier juego socrático para la cuidia observable para el que los equilibrios NASH son computables en los juegos inducidos Gstage2 (Q) (por ejemplo, cuando Gstage2 (Q) es de tamaño constante). Otro modelo de consultas potencialmente interesante en los juegos socráticos es lo que uno podría llamar consultas públicas, en la que tanto la elección como el resultado de una consulta de jugadores son observables por todos los jugadores del juego.(Este modelo podría ser más apropiado en presencia de espionaje corporativo o fugas de medios, o en un entorno en el que las consultas y, por lo tanto, sus resultados se realizan a simple vista). Las técnicas que hemos desarrollado en esta sección también producen exactamente los mismos resultados que para consultas observables. La prueba es realmente más simple: con las consultas públicas, los pagos de los jugadores son de conocimiento común cuando comienza la etapa 2, y por lo tanto, la etapa 2 realmente es un juego de información completa.(Todavía puede haber incertidumbre sobre el mundo real, pero todos los jugadores usan las señales observadas para inferir exactamente el mismo conjunto de posibles mundos en los que Wreal puede mentir; por lo tanto, están jugando un juego de información completa entre sí). Por lo tanto, tenemos los mismos resultados que en los teoremas 5.4 y 5.6 más simplemente, resolviendo la etapa 2 utilizando un buscador (no bayesiano) Nash-equilibrio y resolución de la etapa 1 como antes. Nuestros resultados para consultas observables son más débiles que no observables: en juegos socráticos con mundos que son estratégicamente suma cero pero no suma constante, solo encontramos un equilibrio correlacionado en el caso observable, mientras que encontramos un equilibrio NASH en el caso no observable. Podríamos esperar extender nuestras técnicas no observables a las preguntas a consultas observables, pero no hay una forma obvia de hacerlo. El obstáculo fundamental es que la restricción de pago de LPS se vuelve no lineal si hay alguna dependencia de la probabilidad de que el otro jugador haya hecho una consulta en particular. Esta dependencia surge con consultas observables, lo que sugiere que los juegos socráticos observables con mundos estratégicamente de suma cero pueden ser más difíciles de resolver.6. Trabajo relacionado Nuestro trabajo inicialmente fue motivado por la investigación en las ciencias sociales que indican que las personas reales parecen (irracionalmente) paralizadas cuando se les presentan opciones adicionales. En esta sección, revisamos brevemente algunos de estos experimentos de ciencia social y luego discutimos enfoques técnicos relacionados con la teoría de los juegos socráticos. Prima facie, la felicidad de los agentes racionales dada una opción adicional solo puede aumentar. Sin embargo, investigaciones recientes han encontrado que más opciones tienden a disminuir la felicidad: por ejemplo, los estudiantes que eligen entre opciones de crédito extra es más probable que hagan crédito adicional si se les da un pequeño subconjunto de las opciones y, además, producen trabajos de mayor calidad [35](Ver también [19].) La literatura de psicología explora una serie de explicaciones: las personas pueden calcular mal su costo de oportunidad al comparar su elección con un máximo de componentes de todas las demás opciones en lugar de la mejor alternativa [65], una nueva opción puede llamar la atención indebida a los aspectos de los aspectos de losOtras opciones [67], y así sucesivamente. El presente trabajo explora una explicación económica de este fenómeno: la información no es gratuita. Cuando hay más opciones, un tomador de decisiones debe pasar más tiempo para lograr un resultado satisfactorio. Véase, por ejemplo, el trabajo de Skyrms [68] para una perspectiva filosófica sobre el papel de la deliberación en situaciones estratégicas. Finalmente, notamos la conexión entre los juegos socráticos y la lógica modal [34], un formalismo para la lógica de posibilidad y necesidad. La observación de que los jugadores humanos generalmente no juegan estrategias racionales han inspirado algunos intentos de modelar jugadores parcialmente racionales. El modelo típico de esta racionalidad limitada con la caída [36, 64, 66] es postular los límites de la potencia computacional en la calculación de las consecuencias de una estrategia. El trabajo sobre racionalidad limitada [23, 24, 53, 58] difiere de los modelos que consideramos aquí en eso en lugar de poner limitaciones difíciles en el poder computacional de los agentes, en su lugar restringimos su conocimiento a priori del estado del mundo, exigiéndoles que pasen tiempo (y, por lo tanto, dinero/utilidad) para aprender al respecto. Los juegos estocásticos (POSG) parcialmente observables son un marco general utilizado en la IA para modelar situaciones de planificación de múltiples agentes en un entorno evolutivo y desconocido, pero la generalidad de POSG parece dificultarlos [6]. Se han realizado un trabajo reciente en el desarrollo de algoritmos para clases restringidas de POSG, sobre todo clases de POSGS-E.G., [20, 30], que son muy diferentes de los juegos competitivos estratégicamente de suma cero que abordamos en este documento. La pregunta fundamental en los Juegos Socráticos es decidir sobre el valor comparativo de hacer una consulta más costosa pero más informativa, o concluir la fase de recolección de datos y elegir la mejor opción, dada la información actual. Esta compensación ha sido explorada en una variedad de otros contextos;Un muestreo de estos contextos incluye la agregación de resultados 156 de fuentes de información propensas a retrasos [8], haciendo un razonamiento aproximado en sistemas inteligentes [72], decidiendo cuándo tomar la mejor suposición actual del diagnóstico de enfermedad de una red de creencia y cuándo continuar coninferencia [33], entre muchos otros. Este problema también se puede ver como otra perspectiva sobre la cuestión general de la exploración versus la explotación que surge a menudo en la IA: ¿cuándo es mejor buscar activamente información adicional en lugar de explotar el conocimiento que uno ya tiene?(Ver, por ejemplo, [69].) La mayor parte de este trabajo difiere significativamente del nuestro, ya que considera la planificación de un solo agente en lugar del entorno teórico del juego. Una excepción notable es el trabajo de Larson y Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44] sobre el diseño del mecanismo para agentes interactivos cuyo cálculo es costoso y limitado. Presentan un modelo en el que los jugadores deben resolver un problema de valoración computacionalmente intratable, utilizando un cálculo costoso para aprender algunos parámetros ocultos y resultados para subastas y juegos de negociación en este modelo.7. Las direcciones futuras encontrar eficientemente los equilibrios de Nash en juegos socráticos con mundos no estratégicamente cero son probablemente difícil porque la existencia de tal algoritmo para juegos clásicos ha demostrado ser poco probable [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55]. Sin embargo, ha habido algún éxito algorítmico en la búsqueda de equilibrios de Nash en entornos clásicos restringidos (por ejemplo, [21, 46, 47, 57]);Podríamos esperar extender nuestros resultados a juegos socráticos análogos. Un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar equilibrios correlacionados en los juegos socráticos generales parece más posible. Supongamos que los jugadores reciben consultas y respuestas recomendadas. La dificultad es que cuando un jugador considera una desviación de su consulta recomendada, ya conoce su respuesta recomendada en cada uno de los juegos de la etapa 2. En un equilibrio correlacionado, los jugadores esperan un recompensa generalmente depende de su estrategia recomendada y, por lo tanto, un jugador puede desviarse en la etapa 1 para aterrizar en un juego de la etapa 2 donde se le ha dado una respuesta recomendada mejor que el promedio.(Los juegos socráticos son juegos sucintos de tipo superpolinomio, por lo que los resultados papadimitriosos [56] no implican equilibrios correlacionados para ellos). Los juegos socráticos se pueden extender para permitir a los jugadores hacer consultas adaptativas, eligiendo consultas posteriores basadas en resultados anteriores. Nuestras técnicas se trasladan a O (1) rondas de consultas no observables, pero sería interesante calcular los equilibrios en juegos socráticos con consultas observables adaptables o con Ω (1) rondas de consultas no observables. Los casos especiales de juegos socráticos adaptativos están estrechamente relacionados con problemas de agente único como la latencia mínima [1, 7, 26], determinando estrategias para usar información con precios [9, 29, 37] y una versión en línea de la cobertura de prueba mínima [18,50]. Aunque existen importantes distinciones técnicas entre los juegos socráticos adaptativos y estos problemas, las técnicas de aproximación de esta literatura pueden aplicarse a los juegos socráticos. La cuestión de la aproximación plantea preguntas interesantes incluso en juegos socráticos no adaptativos. Un equilibrio de NASH Apriéxico es un perfil de estrategia α para que ningún jugador pueda aumentar su recompensa mediante un aditivo al desviarse de α. Encontrar equilibrios de Nash aproximados en los juegos socráticos adaptativos y no adaptativos es una dirección interesante para seguir. Otra extensión natural es el modelo donde los resultados de la consulta son estocásticos. En este artículo, modelamos una consulta como dividiendo deterministas los posibles mundos en subconjuntos que la consulta no puede distinguir. Sin embargo, en su lugar, se podría modelar una consulta como mapeo probabilístico del conjunto de posibles mundos en el conjunto de señales. Con esta modificación, nuestro modelo no observable se vuelve equivalente al modelo de Bergemann y V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], en el que el resultado de una consulta es una distribución posterior sobre los mundos. Nuestras técnicas nos permiten calcular los equilibrios en un modelo de cuidia estocástica, siempre que cada consulta se represente como una tabla que, para cada mundo/par de señales, enumera la probabilidad de que la consulta emita esa señal en ese mundo. También es interesante considerar la configuración en la que las consultas de los juegos se especifican mediante una representación compacta de las distribuciones de probabilidad relevantes.(Por ejemplo, uno podría considerar una configuración en la que el algoritmo solo tiene un oráculo de muestreo para las distribuciones posteriores previstas por Bergemann y V¨alim¨aki). Encontrar eficientemente los equilibrios en tales entornos sigue siendo un problema abierto. Otra configuración interesante para los juegos socráticos es cuando el conjunto Q de las consultas disponibles viene dada por Q = P (γ) -I.E., Cada jugador elige hacer un conjunto q ∈ P (γ) de consultas de un conjunto de consultas de tierra específico. Aquí tomamos el costo de la consulta como una función lineal, de modo que δ (q) = p γ∈Q δ ({γ}). Los terrenos naturales incluyen consultas de comparación (si mi oponente está jugando la estrategia AII, ¿preferiría jugar AI o ˆAi?), Consultas de estrategia (¿cuál es mi vector de pagos si juego a la estrategia ai?) Y consultas de identidad mundial (son las son las consultas (son las son lasmundo w ∈ W el mundo real?). Cuando uno puede inferir un polinomio en el número de consultas realizadas por un jugador racional, entonces nuestros resultados producen soluciones eficientes.(Por ejemplo, podemos resolver los juegos de manera eficiente en los que cada elemento de tierra γ ∈ γ tiene δ ({γ}) = ω (m - m), donde M y M denotan los pagos máximos y mínimos a cualquier jugador en cualquier mundo). Por el contrario, es NP-Hard calcular un equilibrio de Nash para dicho juego cuando cada δ ({γ}) ≤ 1/| w | 2, incluso cuando los mundos son suma constante y el jugador II solo tiene una estrategia disponible. Por lo tanto, incluso calcular una mejor respuesta para el jugador I es difícil.(Esta prueba se realiza mediante la reducción de la cobertura de establecimiento; intuitivamente, por costos de consulta suficientemente bajos, Jugador Debo identificar completamente el mundo real a través de sus consultas. Seleccionar un conjunto mínimo de estas consultas es difícil). El reproductor de computación es la mejor respuesta se puede ver como maximizar una función submodular y, por lo tanto, una mejor respuesta puede ser (1 - 1/e) ≈ 0.63 aproximado con avidez [14]. Una pregunta abierta interesante es si este cálculo aproximado de la mejor respuesta se puede aprovechar para encontrar un equilibrio de Nash aproximado.8.

        "Perhaps Californians are susceptible to Nixons advertising, but are unresponsive to Kennedys.",
        "In light of this uncertainty, the Kennedy campaign may conduct a survey, at some cost, to estimate the effectiveness of its advertising.",
        "Moreover, the larger-and more expensive-the survey, the more accurate it will be.",
        "Is the cost of a survey worth the information that it provides?",
        "How should one balance the cost of acquiring more information against the risk of playing a game with higher uncertainty?",
        "In this paper, we model situations of this type as Socratic games.",
        "As in traditional game theory, the players in a Socratic game choose actions to maximize their payoffs, but we model players with incomplete information who can make costly queries to reduce their uncertainty about the state of the world before they choose their actions.",
        "This approach contrasts with traditional game theory, in which players are usually modeled as having fixed, exogenously given information about the structure of the game and its payoffs. (In traditional games of incomplete and imperfect information, there is information that the players do not have; in Socratic games, unlike in these games, the players have a chance to acquire the missing information, at some cost.)",
        "A number of related models have been explored by economists and computer scientists motivated by similar situations, often with a focus on mechanism design and auctions; a sampling of this research includes the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44], Parkes [59], Fong [22], Compte and Jehiel [12], Rezende [63], Persico and Matthews [48, 60], Cr´emer and Khalil [15], Rasmusen [62], and Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5].",
        "The model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki is similar in many regards to the one that we explore here; see Section 7 for some discussion.",
        "A Socratic game proceeds as follows.",
        "A real world is cho150 sen randomly from a set of possible worlds according to a common prior distribution.",
        "Each player then selects an arbitrary query from a set of available costly queries and receives a corresponding piece of information about the real world.",
        "Finally each player selects an action and receives a payoff-a function of the players selected actions and the identity of the real world-less the cost of the query that he or she made.",
        "Compared to traditional game theory, the distinguishing feature of our model is the introduction of explicit costs to the players for learning arbitrary partial information about which of the many possible worlds is the real world.",
        "Our research was initially inspired by recent results in psychology on decision making, but it soon became clear that Socratic game theory is also a general tool for understanding the exploitation versus exploration tradeoff, well studied in machine learning, in a strategic multiplayer environment.",
        "This tension between the risk arising from uncertainty and the cost of acquiring information is ubiquitous in economics, political science, and beyond.",
        "Our results.",
        "We consider Socratic games under two models: an unobservable-query model where players learn only the response to their own queries and an observable-query model where players also learn which queries their opponents made.",
        "We give efficient algorithms to find Nash equilibriai.e., tuples of strategies from which no player has unilateral incentive to deviate-in broad classes of two-player Socratic games in both models.",
        "Our first result is an efficient algorithm to find Nash equilibria in unobservable-query Socratic games with constant-sum worlds, in which the sum of the players payoffs is independent of their actions.",
        "Our techniques also yield Nash equilibria in unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds.",
        "Strategically zero-sum games generalize constant-sum games by allowing the sum of the players payoffs to depend on individual players choices of strategy, but not on any interaction of their choices.",
        "Our second result is an efficient algorithm to find Nash equilibria in observable-query Socratic games with constant-sum worlds.",
        "Finally, we give an efficient algorithm to find correlated equilibria-a weaker but increasingly well-studied solution concept for games [2, 3, 32, 56, 57]-in observable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds.",
        "Like all games, Socratic games can be viewed as a special case of extensive-form games, which represent games by trees in which internal nodes represent choices made by chance or by the players, and the leaves represent outcomes that correspond to a vector of payoffs to the players.",
        "Algorithmically, the generality of extensive-form games makes them difficult to solve efficiently, and the special cases that are known to be efficiently solvable do not include even simple Socratic games.",
        "Every (complete-information) classical game is a trivial Socratic game (with a single possible world and a single trivial query), and efficiently finding Nash equilibria in classical games has been shown to be hard [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55].",
        "Therefore we would not expect to find a straightforward polynomial-time algorithm to compute Nash equilibria in general Socratic games.",
        "However, it is well known that Nash equilibria can be found efficiently via an LP for two-player constant-sum games [49, 71] (and strategically zero-sum games [51]).",
        "A Socratic game is itself a classical game, so one might hope that these results can be applied to Socratic games with constant-sum (or strategically zero-sum) worlds.",
        "We face two major obstacles in extending these classical results to Socratic games.",
        "First, a Socratic game with constant-sum worlds is not itself a constant-sum classical game-rather, the resulting classical game is only strategically zero sum.",
        "Worse yet, a Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds is not itself classically strategically zero sum-indeed, there are no known efficient algorithmic techniques to compute Nash equilibria in the resulting class of classical games. (Exponential-time algorithms like Lemke/Howson, of course, can be used [45].)",
        "Thus even when it is easy to find Nash equilibria in each of the worlds of a Socratic game, we require new techniques to solve the Socratic game itself.",
        "Second, even when the Socratic game itself is strategically zero sum, the number of possible strategies available to each player is exponential in the natural representation of the game.",
        "As a result, the standard linear programs for computing equilibria have an exponential number of variables and an exponential number of constraints.",
        "For unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds, we address these obstacles by formulating a new LP that uses only polynomially many variables (though still an exponential number of constraints) and then use ellipsoid-based techniques to solve it.",
        "For observablequery Socratic games, we handle the exponentiality by decomposing the game into stages, solving the stages separately, and showing how to reassemble the solutions efficiently.",
        "To solve the stages, it is necessary to find Nash equilibria in Bayesian strategically zero-sum games, and we give an explicit polynomial-time algorithm to do so. 2.",
        "GAMES AND SOCRATIC GAMES In this section, we review background on game theory and formally introduce Socratic games.",
        "We present these models in the context of two-player games, but the multiplayer case is a natural extension.",
        "Throughout the paper, boldface variables will be used to denote a pair of variables (e.g., a = ai, aii ).",
        "Let Pr[x ← π] denote the probability that a particular value x is drawn from the distribution π, and let Ex∼π[g(x)] denote the expectation of g(x) when x is drawn from π. 2.1 Background on Game Theory Consider two players, Player I and Player II, each of whom is attempting to maximize his or her utility (or payoff).",
        "A (two-player) game is a pair A, u , where, for i ∈ {i,ii}, • Ai is the set of pure strategies for Player i, and A = Ai, Aii ; and • ui : A → R is the utility function for Player i, and u = ui, uii .",
        "We require that A and u be common knowledge.",
        "If each Player i chooses strategy ai ∈ Ai, then the payoffs to Players I and II are ui(a) and uii(a), respectively.",
        "A game is constant sum if, for all a ∈ A, we have that ui(a) + uii(a) = c for some fixed c independent of a.",
        "Player i can also play a mixed strategy αi ∈ Ai, where Ai denotes the space of probability measures over the set Ai.",
        "Payoff functions are generalized as ui (α) = ui (αi, αii) := Ea∼α[ui (a)] = P a∈A α(a)ui (a), where the quantity α(a) = 151 αi(ai) · αii(aii) denotes the joint probability of the independent events that each Player i chooses action ai from the distribution αi.",
        "This generalization to mixed strategies is known as von Neumann/Morgenstern utility [70], in which players are indifferent between a guaranteed payoff x and an expected payoff of x.",
        "A Nash equilibrium is a pair α of mixed strategies so that neither player has an incentive to change his or her strategy unilaterally.",
        "Formally, the strategy pair α is a Nash equilibrium if and only if both ui(αi, αii) = maxαi∈Ai ui(αi, αii) and uii(αi, αii) = maxαii∈Aii uii(αi, αii); that is, the strategies αi and αii are mutual best responses.",
        "A correlated equilibrium is a distribution ψ over A that obeys the following: if a ∈ A is drawn randomly according to ψ and Player i learns ai, then no Player i has incentive to deviate unilaterally from playing ai. (A Nash equilibrium is a correlated equilibrium in which ψ(a) = αi(ai) · αii(aii) is a product distribution.)",
        "Formally, in a correlated equilibrium, for every a ∈ A we must have that ai is a best response to a randomly chosen ˆaii ∈ Aii drawn according to ψ(ai, ˆaii), and the analogous condition must hold for Player II. 2.2 Socratic Games In this section, we formally define Socratic games.",
        "A Socratic game is a 7-tuple A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ , where, for i ∈ {i,ii}: • Ai is, as before, the set of pure strategies for Player i. • W is a set of possible worlds, one of which is the real world wreal. • ui = {uw i : A → R | w ∈ W} is a set of payoff functions for Player i, one for each possible world. • S is a set of signals. • Qi is a set of available queries for Player i.",
        "When Player i makes query qi : W → S, he or she receives the signal qi(wreal).",
        "When Player i receives signal qi(wreal) in response to query qi, he or she can infer that wreal ∈ {w : qi(w) = qi(wreal)}, i.e., the set of possible worlds from which query qi cannot distinguish wreal. • p : W → [0, 1] is a probability distribution over the possible worlds. • δi : Qi → R≥0 gives the query cost for each available query for Player i.",
        "Initially, the world wreal is chosen according to the probability distribution p, but the identity of wreal remains unknown to the players.",
        "That is, it is as if the players are playing the game A, uwreal but do not know wreal.",
        "The players make queries q ∈ Q, and Player i receives the signal qi(wreal).",
        "We consider both observable queries and unobservable queries.",
        "When queries are observable, each player learns which query was made by the other player, and the results of his or her own query-that is, each Player i learns qi, qii, and qi(wreal).",
        "For unobservable queries, Player i learns only qi and qi(wreal).",
        "After learning the results of the queries, the players select strategies a ∈ A and receive as payoffs u wreal i (a) − δi(qi).",
        "In the Socratic game, a pure strategy for Player i consists of a query qi ∈ Qi and a response function mapping any result of the query qi to a strategy ai ∈ Ai to play.",
        "A players state of knowledge after a query is a point in R := Q × S or Ri := Qi × S for observable or unobservable queries, respectively.",
        "Thus Player is response function maps R or Ri to Ai.",
        "Note that the number of pure strategies is exponential, as there are exponentially many response functions.",
        "A mixed strategy involves both randomly choosing a query qi ∈ Qi and randomly choosing an action ai ∈ Ai in response to the results of the query.",
        "Formally, we will consider a mixed-strategy-function profile f = fquery , fresp to have two parts: • a function fquery i : Qi → [0, 1], where fquery i (qi) is the probability that Player i makes query qi. • a function fresp i that maps R or Ri to a probability distribution over actions.",
        "Player i chooses an action ai ∈ Ai according to the probability distribution fresp i (q, qi(w)) for observable queries, and according to fresp i (qi, qi(w)) for unobservable queries. (With unobservable queries, for example, the probability that Player I plays action ai conditioned on making query qi in world w is given by Pr[ai ← fresp i (qi, qi(w))].)",
        "Mixed strategies are typically defined as probability distributions over the pure strategies, but here we represent a mixed strategy by a pair fquery , fresp , which is commonly referred to as a behavioral strategy in the game-theory literature.",
        "As in any game with perfect recall, one can easily map a mixture of pure strategies to a behavioral strategy f = fquery , fresp that induces the same probability of making a particular query qi or playing a particular action after making a query qi in a particular world.",
        "Thus it suffices to consider only this representation of mixed strategies.",

        "The sum of the players payoffs varies depending upon their strategies, because different queries incur different costs.",
        "However, this game still has significant structure: the sum of payoffs varies only because of varying query costs.",
        "Thus the sum of payoffs does depend on players choice of strategies, but not on the interaction of their choices-i.e., for fixed functions gi and gii, we have ui(q, f) + uii(q, f) = gi(qi, fi) + gii(qii, fii) for all strategies q, f .",
        "Such games are called strategically zero sum and were introduced by Moulin and Vial [51], who describe a notion of strategic equivalence and define strategically zero-sum games as those strategically equivalent to zero-sum games.",

First, suppose that strategy profile f = fquery , fresp forms a Nash equilibrium for G. Then the following setting for the LP variables is feasible: yi qi = fquery i (qi) xi ai,qi,w = Pr[ai ← fresp i (qi, qi(w))] · yi qi ρi = P w,q∈Q,a∈A p(w) · xi ai,qi,w · xii aii,qii,w · [uw i (a) − δi(qi)].

        "Verifying that this strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium requires checking that fresp i (qi, qi(w)) is a well-defined function (from constraint VI), that fquery i and fresp i (qi, qi(w)) are probability distributions (from constraints III and IV), and that each player is playing a best response to his or her opponents strategy (from constraints I and II).",
        "Finally, from constraints I and II, the expected payoff to Player i is at most ρi.",
        "Because the right-hand side of constraint VII is equal to the expected sum of the payoffs from f and is at most ρi + ρii, the payoffs are correct and imply the lemma.",

        "Thus by Theorem 4.3 we can compute Nash equilibria for G∗ , and thus we can compute Bayesian Nash equilibria for G. (LPs for zero-sum two-player Bayesian games have been previously developed and studied [61].)",
        "Theorem 5.4.",
        "We can compute a Nash equilibrium for an arbitrary two-player observable-query Socratic game G = A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ with constant-sum worlds in polynomial time.",
        "Proof.",
        "Because each world of G is constant sum, Lemma 5.2 implies that the induced Stage-2 games Gstage2(q) are all Bayesian constant sum.",
        "Thus we can use algorithm BNE to compute a Bayesian Nash equilibrium hq,BNE := BNE(Gstage2(q)) for each q ∈ Q, by Theorem 5.3.",
        "Furthermore, again by Lemma 5.2, the induced Stage-1 game GBNE stage1 is classical strategically zero sum.",
        "Therefore we can again use algorithm BNE to compute a Nash equilibrium α := BNE(GBNE stage1), again by Theorem 5.3.",
        "Therefore, by Lemma 5.1, we can assemble α and the hq,BNE s into a Nash equilibrium for the Socratic game G. 155 We would like to extend our results on observable-query Socratic games to Socratic games with strategically zerosum worlds.",
        "While we can still find Nash equilibria in the Stage-2 games, the resulting Stage-1 game is not in general strategically zero sum.",
        "Thus, finding Nash equilibria in observable-query Socratic games with strategically zerosum worlds seems to require substantially new techniques.",
        "However, our techniques for decomposing observable-query Socratic games do allow us to find correlated equilibria in this case.",
        "Lemma 5.5.",
        "Consider an observable-query Socratic game G = A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ .",
        "Let alg be an arbitrary algorithm that finds a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in each of the derived Stage-2 games Gstage2(q), and let Galg stage1 be the derived Stage1 game.",
        "Let φ be a correlated equilibrium for Galg stage1, and let hq,alg := alg(Gstage2(q)) be a Bayesian Nash equilibrium for each Gstage2(q).",
        "Then the following distribution over pure strategies is a correlated equilibrium for G: ψ(q, f) := φ(q) Y i∈{i,ii} Y s∈S Pr h fi(q, s) ← hq,alg i (s) i .",
        "Thus to find a correlated equilibrium in an observable-query Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds, we need only algorithm BNE from Theorem 5.3 along with an efficient algorithm for finding a correlated equilibrium in a general game.",
        "Such an algorithm exists (the definition of correlated equilibria can be directly translated into an LP [3]), and therefore we have the following theorem: Theorem 5.6.",
        "We can provide both efficient oracle access and efficient sampling access to a correlated equilibrium for any observable-query two-player Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds.",
        "Because the support of the correlated equilibrium may be exponentially large, providing oracle and sampling access is the natural way to represent the correlated equilibrium.",
        "By Lemma 5.5, we can also compute correlated equilibria in any observable-query Socratic game for which Nash equilibria are computable in the induced Gstage2(q) games (e.g., when Gstage2(q) is of constant size).",
        "Another potentially interesting model of queries in Socratic games is what one might call public queries, in which both the choice and outcome of a players query is observable by all players in the game. (This model might be most appropriate in the presence of corporate espionage or media leaks, or in a setting in which the queries-and thus their results-are done in plain view.)",
        "The techniques that we have developed in this section also yield exactly the same results as for observable queries.",
        "The proof is actually simpler: with public queries, the players payoffs are common knowledge when Stage 2 begins, and thus Stage 2 really is a complete-information game. (There may still be uncertainty about the real world, but all players use the observed signals to infer exactly the same set of possible worlds in which wreal may lie; thus they are playing a complete-information game against each other.)",
        "Thus we have the same results as in Theorems 5.4 and 5.6 more simply, by solving Stage 2 using a (non-Bayesian) Nash-equilibrium finder and solving Stage 1 as before.",
        "Our results for observable queries are weaker than for unobservable: in Socratic games with worlds that are strategically zero sum but not constant sum, we find only a correlated equilibrium in the observable case, whereas we find a Nash equilibrium in the unobservable case.",
        "We might hope to extend our unobservable-query techniques to observable queries, but there is no obvious way to do so.",
        "The fundamental obstacle is that the LPs payoff constraint becomes nonlinear if there is any dependence on the probability that the other player made a particular query.",
        "This dependence arises with observable queries, suggesting that observable Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds may be harder to solve. 6.",
        "RELATED WORK Our work was initially motivated by research in the social sciences indicating that real people seem (irrationally) paralyzed when they are presented with additional options.",
        "In this section, we briefly review some of these social-science experiments and then discuss technical approaches related to Socratic game theory.",
        "Prima facie, a rational agents happiness given an added option can only increase.",
        "However, recent research has found that more choices tend to decrease happiness: for example, students choosing among extra-credit options are more likely to do extra credit if given a small subset of the choices and, moreover, produce higher-quality work [35]. (See also [19].)",
        "The psychology literature explores a number of explanations: people may miscalculate their opportunity cost by comparing their choice to a component-wise maximum of all other options instead of the single best alternative [65], a new option may draw undue attention to aspects of the other options [67], and so on.",
        "The present work explores an economic explanation of this phenomenon: information is not free.",
        "When there are more options, a decision-maker must spend more time to achieve a satisfactory outcome.",
        "See, e.g., the work of Skyrms [68] for a philosophical perspective on the role of deliberation in strategic situations.",
        "Finally, we note the connection between Socratic games and modal logic [34], a formalism for the logic of possibility and necessity.",
        "The observation that human players typically do not play rational strategies has inspired some attempts to model partially rational players.",
        "The typical model of this socalled bounded rationality [36, 64, 66] is to postulate bounds on computational power in computing the consequences of a strategy.",
        "The work on bounded rationality [23, 24, 53, 58] differs from the models that we consider here in that instead of putting hard limitations on the computational power of the agents, we instead restrict their a priori knowledge of the state of the world, requiring them to spend time (and therefore money/utility) to learn about it.",
        "Partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) are a general framework used in AI to model situations of multi-agent planning in an evolving, unknown environment, but the generality of POSGs seems to make them very difficult [6].",
        "Recent work has been done in developing algorithms for restricted classes of POSGs, most notably classes of cooperative POSGs-e.g., [20, 30]-which are very different from the competitive strategically zero-sum games we address in this paper.",
        "The fundamental question in Socratic games is deciding on the comparative value of making a more costly but more informative query, or concluding the data-gathering phase and picking the best option, given current information.",
        "This tradeoff has been explored in a variety of other contexts; a sampling of these contexts includes aggregating results 156 from delay-prone information sources [8], doing approximate reasoning in intelligent systems [72], deciding when to take the current best guess of disease diagnosis from a beliefpropagation network and when to let it continue inference [33], among many others.",
        "This issue can also be viewed as another perspective on the general question of exploration versus exploitation that arises often in AI: when is it better to actively seek additional information instead of exploiting the knowledge one already has? (See, e.g., [69].)",
        "Most of this work differs significantly from our own in that it considers single-agent planning as opposed to the game-theoretic setting.",
        "A notable exception is the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44] on mechanism design for interacting agents whose computation is costly and limited.",
        "They present a model in which players must solve a computationally intractable valuation problem, using costly computation to learn some hidden parameters, and results for auctions and bargaining games in this model. 7.",
        "FUTURE DIRECTIONS Efficiently finding Nash equilibria in Socratic games with non-strategically zero-sum worlds is probably difficult because the existence of such an algorithm for classical games has been shown to be unlikely [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55].",
        "There has, however, been some algorithmic success in finding Nash equilibria in restricted classical settings (e.g., [21, 46, 47, 57]); we might hope to extend our results to analogous Socratic games.",
        "An efficient algorithm to find correlated equilibria in general Socratic games seems more attainable.",
        "Suppose the players receive recommended queries and responses.",
        "The difficulty is that when a player considers a deviation from his recommended query, he already knows his recommended response in each of the Stage-2 games.",
        "In a correlated equilibrium, a players expected payoff generally depends on his recommended strategy, and thus a player may deviate in Stage 1 so as to land in a Stage-2 game where he has been given a better than average recommended response. (Socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type, so Papadimitrious results [56] do not imply correlated equilibria for them.)",
        "Socratic games can be extended to allow players to make adaptive queries, choosing subsequent queries based on previous results.",
        "Our techniques carry over to O(1) rounds of unobservable queries, but it would be interesting to compute equilibria in Socratic games with adaptive observable queries or with ω(1) rounds of unobservable queries.",
        "Special cases of adaptive Socratic games are closely related to single-agent problems like minimum latency [1, 7, 26], determining strategies for using priced information [9, 29, 37], and an online version of minimum test cover [18, 50].",
        "Although there are important technical distinctions between adaptive Socratic games and these problems, approximation techniques from this literature may apply to Socratic games.",
        "The question of approximation raises interesting questions even in non-adaptive Socratic games.",
        "An -approximate Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile α so that no player can increase her payoff by an additive by deviating from α.",
        "Finding approximate Nash equilibria in both adaptive and non-adaptive Socratic games is an interesting direction to pursue.",
        "Another natural extension is the model where query results are stochastic.",
        "In this paper, we model a query as deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into subsets that the query cannot distinguish.",
        "However, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals.",
        "With this modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds.",
        "Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.",
        "It is also interesting to consider settings in which the games queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions. (For example, one might consider a setting in which the algorithm has only a sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki.)",
        "Efficiently finding equilibria in such settings remains an open problem.",
        "Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries.",
        "Here we take the query cost to be a linear function, so that δ(q) = P γ∈q δ({γ}).",
        "Natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my opponent is playing strategy aii, would I prefer to play ai or ˆai? ), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if I play strategy ai? ), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ W the real world?).",
        "When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions. (For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)",
        "Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy.",
        "Thus even computing a best response for Player I is hard. (This proof proceeds by reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, Player I must fully identify the actual world through his queries.",
        "Selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries is hard.)",
        "Computing Player Is best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14].",
        "An interesting open question is whether this approximate best-response calculation can be leveraged to find an approximate Nash equilibrium. 8.",

                "First, a Socratic game with constant-sum worlds is not itself a constant-sum classical game-rather, the resulting classical game is only strategically zero sum.",
                "Worse yet, a Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds is not itself classically strategically zero sum-indeed, there are no known efficient algorithmic techniques to compute Nash equilibria in the resulting class of classical games. (Exponential-time algorithms like Lemke/Howson, of course, can be used [45].)",
                "Thus even when it is easy to find Nash equilibria in each of the worlds of a Socratic game, we require new techniques to solve the Socratic game itself.",
                "Second, even when the Socratic game itself is strategically zero sum, the number of possible strategies available to each player is exponential in the natural representation of the game.",

                "However, recent research has found that more choices tend to decrease happiness: for example, students choosing among extra-credit options are more likely to do extra credit if given a small subset of the choices and, moreover, produce higher-quality work [35]. (See also [19].)",
                "The psychology literature explores a number of explanations: people may miscalculate their opportunity cost by comparing their choice to a component-wise maximum of all other options instead of the single best alternative [65], a new option may draw undue attention to aspects of the other options [67], and so on.",
                "The present work explores an economic explanation of this phenomenon: information is not free.",
                "When there are more options, a decision-maker must spend more time to achieve a satisfactory outcome.",
                "See, e.g., the work of Skyrms [68] for a philosophical perspective on the role of deliberation in strategic situations.",
                "Finally, we note the connection between Socratic games and modal logic [34], a formalism for the logic of possibility and necessity.",
                "The observation that human players typically do not play rational strategies has inspired some attempts to model partially rational players.",
                "The typical model of this socalled bounded rationality [36, 64, 66] is to postulate bounds on computational power in computing the consequences of a strategy.",
                "The work on bounded rationality [23, 24, 53, 58] differs from the models that we consider here in that instead of putting hard limitations on the computational power of the agents, we instead restrict their a priori knowledge of the state of the world, requiring them to spend time (and therefore money/utility) to learn about it.",
                "Partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) are a general framework used in AI to model situations of multi-agent planning in an evolving, unknown environment, but the generality of POSGs seems to make them very difficult [6].",
                "Recent work has been done in developing algorithms for restricted classes of POSGs, most notably classes of cooperative POSGs-e.g., [20, 30]-which are very different from the competitive strategically zero-sum games we address in this paper.",
                "The fundamental question in Socratic games is deciding on the comparative value of making a more costly but more informative query, or concluding the data-gathering phase and picking the best option, given current information.",
                "This tradeoff has been explored in a variety of other contexts; a sampling of these contexts includes aggregating results 156 from delay-prone information sources [8], doing approximate reasoning in intelligent systems [72], deciding when to take the current best guess of disease diagnosis from a beliefpropagation network and when to let it continue inference [33], among many others.",
                "This issue can also be viewed as another perspective on the general question of exploration versus exploitation that arises often in AI: when is it better to actively seek additional information instead of exploiting the knowledge one already has? (See, e.g., [69].)",
                "Most of this work differs significantly from our own in that it considers single-agent planning as opposed to the game-theoretic setting.",
                "A notable exception is the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44] on mechanism design for interacting agents whose computation is costly and limited.",
                "They present a model in which players must solve a computationally intractable valuation problem, using costly computation to learn some hidden parameters, and results for auctions and bargaining games in this model. 7.",
                "FUTURE DIRECTIONS Efficiently finding Nash equilibria in Socratic games with non-strategically zero-sum worlds is probably difficult because the existence of such an algorithm for classical games has been shown to be unlikely [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55].",
                "There has, however, been some algorithmic success in finding Nash equilibria in restricted classical settings (e.g., [21, 46, 47, 57]); we might hope to extend our results to analogous Socratic games.",
                "An efficient algorithm to find correlated equilibria in general Socratic games seems more attainable.",
                "Suppose the players receive recommended queries and responses.",
                "The difficulty is that when a player considers a deviation from his recommended query, he already knows his recommended response in each of the Stage-2 games.",
                "In a correlated equilibrium, a players expected payoff generally depends on his recommended strategy, and thus a player may deviate in Stage 1 so as to land in a Stage-2 game where he has been given a better than average recommended response. (Socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type, so Papadimitrious results [56] do not imply correlated equilibria for them.)",
                "Socratic games can be extended to allow players to make adaptive queries, choosing subsequent queries based on previous results.",
                "Our techniques carry over to O(1) rounds of unobservable queries, but it would be interesting to compute equilibria in Socratic games with adaptive observable queries or with ω(1) rounds of unobservable queries.",
                "Special cases of adaptive Socratic games are closely related to single-agent problems like minimum latency [1, 7, 26], determining strategies for using priced information [9, 29, 37], and an online version of minimum test cover [18, 50].",
                "Although there are important technical distinctions between adaptive Socratic games and these problems, approximation techniques from this literature may apply to Socratic games.",
                "The question of approximation raises interesting questions even in non-adaptive Socratic games.",
                "An -approximate Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile α so that no player can increase her payoff by an additive by deviating from α.",
                "Finding approximate Nash equilibria in both adaptive and non-adaptive Socratic games is an interesting direction to pursue.",
                "Another natural extension is the model where query results are stochastic.",
                "In this paper, we model a query as deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into subsets that the query cannot distinguish.",
                "However, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals.",
                "With this modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds.",
                "Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.",
                "It is also interesting to consider settings in which the games queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions. (For example, one might consider a setting in which the algorithm has only a sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki.)",
                "Efficiently finding equilibria in such settings remains an open problem.",
                "Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries.",
                "Here we take the query cost to be a linear function, so that δ(q) = P γ∈q δ({γ}).",
                "Natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my opponent is playing strategy aii, would I prefer to play ai or ˆai? ), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if I play strategy ai? ), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ W the real world?).",
                "When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions. (For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)",
                "Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy.",
                "Thus even computing a best response for Player I is hard. (This proof proceeds by reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, Player I must fully identify the actual world through his queries.",
                "Selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries is hard.)",
                "Computing Player Is best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14].",
                "An interesting open question is whether this approximate best-response calculation can be leveraged to find an approximate Nash equilibrium. 8.",

                "First, a Socratic game with constant-sum worlds is not itself a constant-sum classical game-rather, the resulting classical game is only strategically zero sum.",
                "Worse yet, a Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds is not itself classically strategically zero sum-indeed, there are no known efficient algorithmic techniques to compute Nash equilibria in the resulting class of classical games. (Exponential-time algorithms like Lemke/Howson, of course, can be used [45].)",
                "Thus even when it is easy to find Nash equilibria in each of the worlds of a Socratic game, we require new techniques to solve the Socratic game itself.",
                "Second, even when the Socratic game itself is strategically zero sum, the number of possible strategies available to each player is exponential in the natural representation of the game.",
                "As a result, the standard linear programs for computing equilibria have an exponential number of variables and an exponential number of constraints.",
                "For unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds, we address these obstacles by formulating a new LP that uses only polynomially many variables (though still an exponential number of constraints) and then use ellipsoid-based techniques to solve it.",
                "For observablequery Socratic games, we handle the exponentiality by decomposing the game into stages, solving the stages separately, and showing how to reassemble the solutions efficiently.",

                "The psychology literature explores a number of explanations: people may miscalculate their opportunity cost by comparing their choice to a component-wise maximum of all other options instead of the single best alternative [65], a new option may draw undue attention to aspects of the other options [67], and so on.",
                "The present work explores an economic explanation of this phenomenon: information is not free.",
                "When there are more options, a decision-maker must spend more time to achieve a satisfactory outcome.",
                "See, e.g., the work of Skyrms [68] for a philosophical perspective on the role of deliberation in strategic situations.",
                "Finally, we note the connection between Socratic games and modal logic [34], a formalism for the logic of possibility and necessity.",
                "The observation that human players typically do not play rational strategies has inspired some attempts to model partially rational players.",
                "The typical model of this socalled bounded rationality [36, 64, 66] is to postulate bounds on computational power in computing the consequences of a strategy.",
                "The work on bounded rationality [23, 24, 53, 58] differs from the models that we consider here in that instead of putting hard limitations on the computational power of the agents, we instead restrict their a priori knowledge of the state of the world, requiring them to spend time (and therefore money/utility) to learn about it.",
                "Partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) are a general framework used in AI to model situations of multi-agent planning in an evolving, unknown environment, but the generality of POSGs seems to make them very difficult [6].",
                "Recent work has been done in developing algorithms for restricted classes of POSGs, most notably classes of cooperative POSGs-e.g., [20, 30]-which are very different from the competitive strategically zero-sum games we address in this paper.",
                "The fundamental question in Socratic games is deciding on the comparative value of making a more costly but more informative query, or concluding the data-gathering phase and picking the best option, given current information.",
                "This tradeoff has been explored in a variety of other contexts; a sampling of these contexts includes aggregating results 156 from delay-prone information sources [8], doing approximate reasoning in intelligent systems [72], deciding when to take the current best guess of disease diagnosis from a beliefpropagation network and when to let it continue inference [33], among many others.",
                "This issue can also be viewed as another perspective on the general question of exploration versus exploitation that arises often in AI: when is it better to actively seek additional information instead of exploiting the knowledge one already has? (See, e.g., [69].)",
                "Most of this work differs significantly from our own in that it considers single-agent planning as opposed to the game-theoretic setting.",
                "A notable exception is the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44] on mechanism design for interacting agents whose computation is costly and limited.",
                "They present a model in which players must solve a computationally intractable valuation problem, using costly computation to learn some hidden parameters, and results for auctions and bargaining games in this model. 7.",
                "FUTURE DIRECTIONS Efficiently finding Nash equilibria in Socratic games with non-strategically zero-sum worlds is probably difficult because the existence of such an algorithm for classical games has been shown to be unlikely [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55].",
                "There has, however, been some algorithmic success in finding Nash equilibria in restricted classical settings (e.g., [21, 46, 47, 57]); we might hope to extend our results to analogous Socratic games.",
                "An efficient algorithm to find correlated equilibria in general Socratic games seems more attainable.",
                "Suppose the players receive recommended queries and responses.",
                "The difficulty is that when a player considers a deviation from his recommended query, he already knows his recommended response in each of the Stage-2 games.",
                "In a correlated equilibrium, a players expected payoff generally depends on his recommended strategy, and thus a player may deviate in Stage 1 so as to land in a Stage-2 game where he has been given a better than average recommended response. (Socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type, so Papadimitrious results [56] do not imply correlated equilibria for them.)",
                "Socratic games can be extended to allow players to make adaptive queries, choosing subsequent queries based on previous results.",
                "Our techniques carry over to O(1) rounds of unobservable queries, but it would be interesting to compute equilibria in Socratic games with adaptive observable queries or with ω(1) rounds of unobservable queries.",
                "Special cases of adaptive Socratic games are closely related to single-agent problems like minimum latency [1, 7, 26], determining strategies for using priced information [9, 29, 37], and an online version of minimum test cover [18, 50].",
                "Although there are important technical distinctions between adaptive Socratic games and these problems, approximation techniques from this literature may apply to Socratic games.",
                "The question of approximation raises interesting questions even in non-adaptive Socratic games.",
                "An -approximate Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile α so that no player can increase her payoff by an additive by deviating from α.",
                "Finding approximate Nash equilibria in both adaptive and non-adaptive Socratic games is an interesting direction to pursue.",
                "Another natural extension is the model where query results are stochastic.",
                "In this paper, we model a query as deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into subsets that the query cannot distinguish.",
                "However, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals.",
                "With this modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds.",
                "Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.",
                "It is also interesting to consider settings in which the games queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions. (For example, one might consider a setting in which the algorithm has only a sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki.)",
                "Efficiently finding equilibria in such settings remains an open problem.",
                "Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries.",
                "Here we take the query cost to be a linear function, so that δ(q) = P γ∈q δ({γ}).",
                "Natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my opponent is playing strategy aii, would I prefer to play ai or ˆai? ), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if I play strategy ai? ), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ W the real world?).",
                "When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions. (For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)",
                "Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy.",
                "Thus even computing a best response for Player I is hard. (This proof proceeds by reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, Player I must fully identify the actual world through his queries.",
                "Selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries is hard.)",
                "Computing Player Is best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14].",
                "An interesting open question is whether this approximate best-response calculation can be leveraged to find an approximate Nash equilibrium. 8.",

(Exponential-time algorithms like Lemke/Howson, of course, can be used [45].)",
                "Thus even when it is easy to find Nash equilibria in each of the worlds of a Socratic game, we require new techniques to solve the Socratic game itself.",
                "Second, even when the Socratic game itself is strategically zero sum, the number of possible strategies available to each player is exponential in the natural representation of the game.",

                "For unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds, we address these obstacles by formulating a new LP that uses only polynomially many variables (though still an exponential number of constraints) and then use ellipsoid-based techniques to solve it.",
                "For observablequery Socratic games, we handle the exponentiality by decomposing the game into stages, solving the stages separately, and showing how to reassemble the solutions efficiently.",

(Socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type, so Papadimitrious results [56] do not imply correlated equilibria for them.)",
                "Socratic games can be extended to allow players to make adaptive queries, choosing subsequent queries based on previous results.",
                "Our techniques carry over to O(1) rounds of unobservable queries, but it would be interesting to compute equilibria in Socratic games with adaptive observable queries or with ω(1) rounds of unobservable queries.",
                "Special cases of adaptive Socratic games are closely related to single-agent problems like minimum latency [1, 7, 26], determining strategies for using priced information [9, 29, 37], and an online version of minimum test cover [18, 50].",
                "Although there are important technical distinctions between adaptive Socratic games and these problems, approximation techniques from this literature may apply to Socratic games.",
                "The question of approximation raises interesting questions even in non-adaptive Socratic games.",
                "An -approximate Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile α so that no player can increase her payoff by an additive by deviating from α.",
                "Finding approximate Nash equilibria in both adaptive and non-adaptive Socratic games is an interesting direction to pursue.",
                "Another natural extension is the model where query results are stochastic.",
                "In this paper, we model a query as deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into subsets that the query cannot distinguish.",
                "However, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals.",
                "With this modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds.",
                "Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.",
                "It is also interesting to consider settings in which the games queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions. (For example, one might consider a setting in which the algorithm has only a sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki.)",
                "Efficiently finding equilibria in such settings remains an open problem.",
                "Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries.",
                "Here we take the query cost to be a linear function, so that δ(q) = P γ∈q δ({γ}).",
                "Natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my opponent is playing strategy aii, would I prefer to play ai or ˆai? ), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if I play strategy ai? ), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ W the real world?).",
                "When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions. (For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)",
                "Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy.",
                "Thus even computing a best response for Player I is hard. (This proof proceeds by reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, Player I must fully identify the actual world through his queries.",
                "Selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries is hard.)",
                "Computing Player Is best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14].",
                "An interesting open question is whether this approximate best-response calculation can be leveraged to find an approximate Nash equilibrium. 8.",

(For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)",

                "Computing Player Is best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14].",

                "This approach contrasts with traditional game theory, in which players are usually modeled as having fixed, exogenously given information about the structure of the game and its payoffs. (In traditional games of incomplete and imperfect information, there is information that the players do not have; in Socratic games, unlike in these games, the players have a chance to acquire the missing information, at some cost.)",
                "A number of related models have been explored by economists and computer scientists motivated by similar situations, often with a focus on mechanism design and auctions; a sampling of this research includes the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44], Parkes [59], Fong [22], Compte and Jehiel [12], Rezende [63], Persico and Matthews [48, 60], Cr´emer and Khalil [15], Rasmusen [62], and Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5].",

                "Compared to traditional game theory, the distinguishing feature of our model is the introduction of explicit costs to the players for learning arbitrary partial information about which of the many possible worlds is the real world.",
                "Our research was initially inspired by recent results in psychology on decision making, but it soon became clear that Socratic game theory is also a general tool for understanding the exploitation versus exploration tradeoff, well studied in machine learning, in a strategic multiplayer environment.",

                "First, a Socratic game with constant-sum worlds is not itself a constant-sum classical game-rather, the resulting classical game is only strategically zero sum.",
                "Worse yet, a Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds is not itself classically strategically zero sum-indeed, there are no known efficient algorithmic techniques to compute Nash equilibria in the resulting class of classical games. (Exponential-time algorithms like Lemke/Howson, of course, can be used [45].)",
                "Thus even when it is easy to find Nash equilibria in each of the worlds of a Socratic game, we require new techniques to solve the Socratic game itself.",
                "Second, even when the Socratic game itself is strategically zero sum, the number of possible strategies available to each player is exponential in the natural representation of the game.",
                "As a result, the standard linear programs for computing equilibria have an exponential number of variables and an exponential number of constraints.",
                "For unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds, we address these obstacles by formulating a new LP that uses only polynomially many variables (though still an exponential number of constraints) and then use ellipsoid-based techniques to solve it.",
                "For observablequery Socratic games, we handle the exponentiality by decomposing the game into stages, solving the stages separately, and showing how to reassemble the solutions efficiently.",

                "Thus to find a correlated equilibrium in an observable-query Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds, we need only algorithm BNE from Theorem 5.3 along with an efficient algorithm for finding a correlated equilibrium in a general game.",

                "Another potentially interesting model of queries in Socratic games is what one might call public queries, in which both the choice and outcome of a players query is observable by all players in the game. (This model might be most appropriate in the presence of corporate espionage or media leaks, or in a setting in which the queries-and thus their results-are done in plain view.)",
                "The techniques that we have developed in this section also yield exactly the same results as for observable queries.",
                "The proof is actually simpler: with public queries, the players payoffs are common knowledge when Stage 2 begins, and thus Stage 2 really is a complete-information game. (There may still be uncertainty about the real world, but all players use the observed signals to infer exactly the same set of possible worlds in which wreal may lie; thus they are playing a complete-information game against each other.)",

                "Our results for observable queries are weaker than for unobservable: in Socratic games with worlds that are strategically zero sum but not constant sum, we find only a correlated equilibrium in the observable case, whereas we find a Nash equilibrium in the unobservable case.",

                "However, recent research has found that more choices tend to decrease happiness: for example, students choosing among extra-credit options are more likely to do extra credit if given a small subset of the choices and, moreover, produce higher-quality work [35]. (See also [19].)",
                "The psychology literature explores a number of explanations: people may miscalculate their opportunity cost by comparing their choice to a component-wise maximum of all other options instead of the single best alternative [65], a new option may draw undue attention to aspects of the other options [67], and so on.",

                "The work on bounded rationality [23, 24, 53, 58] differs from the models that we consider here in that instead of putting hard limitations on the computational power of the agents, we instead restrict their a priori knowledge of the state of the world, requiring them to spend time (and therefore money/utility) to learn about it.",
                "Partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) are a general framework used in AI to model situations of multi-agent planning in an evolving, unknown environment, but the generality of POSGs seems to make them very difficult [6].",
                "Recent work has been done in developing algorithms for restricted classes of POSGs, most notably classes of cooperative POSGs-e.g., [20, 30]-which are very different from the competitive strategically zero-sum games we address in this paper.",
                "The fundamental question in Socratic games is deciding on the comparative value of making a more costly but more informative query, or concluding the data-gathering phase and picking the best option, given current information.",
                "This tradeoff has been explored in a variety of other contexts; a sampling of these contexts includes aggregating results 156 from delay-prone information sources [8], doing approximate reasoning in intelligent systems [72], deciding when to take the current best guess of disease diagnosis from a beliefpropagation network and when to let it continue inference [33], among many others.",
                "This issue can also be viewed as another perspective on the general question of exploration versus exploitation that arises often in AI: when is it better to actively seek additional information instead of exploiting the knowledge one already has? (See, e.g., [69].)",
                "Most of this work differs significantly from our own in that it considers single-agent planning as opposed to the game-theoretic setting.",

                "They present a model in which players must solve a computationally intractable valuation problem, using costly computation to learn some hidden parameters, and results for auctions and bargaining games in this model. 7.",
                "FUTURE DIRECTIONS Efficiently finding Nash equilibria in Socratic games with non-strategically zero-sum worlds is probably difficult because the existence of such an algorithm for classical games has been shown to be unlikely [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55].",
                "There has, however, been some algorithmic success in finding Nash equilibria in restricted classical settings (e.g., [21, 46, 47, 57]); we might hope to extend our results to analogous Socratic games.",

                "Suppose the players receive recommended queries and responses.",
                "The difficulty is that when a player considers a deviation from his recommended query, he already knows his recommended response in each of the Stage-2 games.",
                "In a correlated equilibrium, a players expected payoff generally depends on his recommended strategy, and thus a player may deviate in Stage 1 so as to land in a Stage-2 game where he has been given a better than average recommended response. (Socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type, so Papadimitrious results [56] do not imply correlated equilibria for them.)",
                "Socratic games can be extended to allow players to make adaptive queries, choosing subsequent queries based on previous results.",
                "Our techniques carry over to O(1) rounds of unobservable queries, but it would be interesting to compute equilibria in Socratic games with adaptive observable queries or with ω(1) rounds of unobservable queries.",
                "Special cases of adaptive Socratic games are closely related to single-agent problems like minimum latency [1, 7, 26], determining strategies for using priced information [9, 29, 37], and an online version of minimum test cover [18, 50].",
                "Although there are important technical distinctions between adaptive Socratic games and these problems, approximation techniques from this literature may apply to Socratic games.",

                "An -approximate Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile α so that no player can increase her payoff by an additive by deviating from α.",
                "Finding approximate Nash equilibria in both adaptive and non-adaptive Socratic games is an interesting direction to pursue.",
                "Another natural extension is the model where query results are stochastic.",
                "In this paper, we model a query as deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into subsets that the query cannot distinguish.",
                "However, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals.",
                "With this modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds.",
                "Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.",
                "It is also interesting to consider settings in which the games queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions. (For example, one might consider a setting in which the algorithm has only a sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki.)",
                "Efficiently finding equilibria in such settings remains an open problem.",
                "Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries.",
                "Here we take the query cost to be a linear function, so that δ(q) = P γ∈q δ({γ}).",
                "Natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my opponent is playing strategy aii, would I prefer to play ai or ˆai? ), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if I play strategy ai? ), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ W the real world?).",
                "When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions. (For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)",
                "Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy.",
                "Thus even computing a best response for Player I is hard. (This proof proceeds by reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, Player I must fully identify the actual world through his queries.",
                "Selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries is hard.)",
                "Computing Player Is best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14].",

                "We give efficient algorithms to find Nash equilibriai.e., tuples of strategies from which no player has unilateral incentive to deviate-in broad classes of two-player Socratic games in both models.",
                "Our first result is an efficient algorithm to find Nash equilibria in unobservable-query Socratic games with constant-sum worlds, in which the sum of the players payoffs is independent of their actions.",

                "Like all games, Socratic games can be viewed as a special case of extensive-form games, which represent games by trees in which internal nodes represent choices made by chance or by the players, and the leaves represent outcomes that correspond to a vector of payoffs to the players.",
                "Algorithmically, the generality of extensive-form games makes them difficult to solve efficiently, and the special cases that are known to be efficiently solvable do not include even simple Socratic games.",

                "Therefore we would not expect to find a straightforward polynomial-time algorithm to compute Nash equilibria in general Socratic games.",

                "We face two major obstacles in extending these classical results to Socratic games.",
                "First, a Socratic game with constant-sum worlds is not itself a constant-sum classical game-rather, the resulting classical game is only strategically zero sum.",
                "Worse yet, a Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds is not itself classically strategically zero sum-indeed, there are no known efficient algorithmic techniques to compute Nash equilibria in the resulting class of classical games. (Exponential-time algorithms like Lemke/Howson, of course, can be used [45].)",
                "Thus even when it is easy to find Nash equilibria in each of the worlds of a Socratic game, we require new techniques to solve the Socratic game itself.",
                "Second, even when the Socratic game itself is strategically zero sum, the number of possible strategies available to each player is exponential in the natural representation of the game.",
                "As a result, the standard linear programs for computing equilibria have an exponential number of variables and an exponential number of constraints.",
                "For unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds, we address these obstacles by formulating a new LP that uses only polynomially many variables (though still an exponential number of constraints) and then use ellipsoid-based techniques to solve it.",
                "For observablequery Socratic games, we handle the exponentiality by decomposing the game into stages, solving the stages separately, and showing how to reassemble the solutions efficiently.",
                "To solve the stages, it is necessary to find Nash equilibria in Bayesian strategically zero-sum games, and we give an explicit polynomial-time algorithm to do so. 2.",

                "Because the support of the correlated equilibrium may be exponentially large, providing oracle and sampling access is the natural way to represent the correlated equilibrium.",
                "By Lemma 5.5, we can also compute correlated equilibria in any observable-query Socratic game for which Nash equilibria are computable in the induced Gstage2(q) games (e.g., when Gstage2(q) is of constant size).",
                "Another potentially interesting model of queries in Socratic games is what one might call public queries, in which both the choice and outcome of a players query is observable by all players in the game. (This model might be most appropriate in the presence of corporate espionage or media leaks, or in a setting in which the queries-and thus their results-are done in plain view.)",
                "The techniques that we have developed in this section also yield exactly the same results as for observable queries.",
                "The proof is actually simpler: with public queries, the players payoffs are common knowledge when Stage 2 begins, and thus Stage 2 really is a complete-information game. (There may still be uncertainty about the real world, but all players use the observed signals to infer exactly the same set of possible worlds in which wreal may lie; thus they are playing a complete-information game against each other.)",
                "Thus we have the same results as in Theorems 5.4 and 5.6 more simply, by solving Stage 2 using a (non-Bayesian) Nash-equilibrium finder and solving Stage 1 as before.",
                "Our results for observable queries are weaker than for unobservable: in Socratic games with worlds that are strategically zero sum but not constant sum, we find only a correlated equilibrium in the observable case, whereas we find a Nash equilibrium in the unobservable case.",
                "We might hope to extend our unobservable-query techniques to observable queries, but there is no obvious way to do so.",
                "The fundamental obstacle is that the LPs payoff constraint becomes nonlinear if there is any dependence on the probability that the other player made a particular query.",
                "This dependence arises with observable queries, suggesting that observable Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds may be harder to solve. 6.",
                "RELATED WORK Our work was initially motivated by research in the social sciences indicating that real people seem (irrationally) paralyzed when they are presented with additional options.",
                "In this section, we briefly review some of these social-science experiments and then discuss technical approaches related to Socratic game theory.",
                "Prima facie, a rational agents happiness given an added option can only increase.",
                "However, recent research has found that more choices tend to decrease happiness: for example, students choosing among extra-credit options are more likely to do extra credit if given a small subset of the choices and, moreover, produce higher-quality work [35]. (See also [19].)",
                "The psychology literature explores a number of explanations: people may miscalculate their opportunity cost by comparing their choice to a component-wise maximum of all other options instead of the single best alternative [65], a new option may draw undue attention to aspects of the other options [67], and so on.",
                "The present work explores an economic explanation of this phenomenon: information is not free.",
                "When there are more options, a decision-maker must spend more time to achieve a satisfactory outcome.",
                "See, e.g., the work of Skyrms [68] for a philosophical perspective on the role of deliberation in strategic situations.",
                "Finally, we note the connection between Socratic games and modal logic [34], a formalism for the logic of possibility and necessity.",
                "The observation that human players typically do not play rational strategies has inspired some attempts to model partially rational players.",
                "The typical model of this socalled bounded rationality [36, 64, 66] is to postulate bounds on computational power in computing the consequences of a strategy.",
                "The work on bounded rationality [23, 24, 53, 58] differs from the models that we consider here in that instead of putting hard limitations on the computational power of the agents, we instead restrict their a priori knowledge of the state of the world, requiring them to spend time (and therefore money/utility) to learn about it.",
                "Partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) are a general framework used in AI to model situations of multi-agent planning in an evolving, unknown environment, but the generality of POSGs seems to make them very difficult [6].",
                "Recent work has been done in developing algorithms for restricted classes of POSGs, most notably classes of cooperative POSGs-e.g., [20, 30]-which are very different from the competitive strategically zero-sum games we address in this paper.",
                "The fundamental question in Socratic games is deciding on the comparative value of making a more costly but more informative query, or concluding the data-gathering phase and picking the best option, given current information.",
                "This tradeoff has been explored in a variety of other contexts; a sampling of these contexts includes aggregating results 156 from delay-prone information sources [8], doing approximate reasoning in intelligent systems [72], deciding when to take the current best guess of disease diagnosis from a beliefpropagation network and when to let it continue inference [33], among many others.",
                "This issue can also be viewed as another perspective on the general question of exploration versus exploitation that arises often in AI: when is it better to actively seek additional information instead of exploiting the knowledge one already has? (See, e.g., [69].)",
                "Most of this work differs significantly from our own in that it considers single-agent planning as opposed to the game-theoretic setting.",
                "A notable exception is the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44] on mechanism design for interacting agents whose computation is costly and limited.",
                "They present a model in which players must solve a computationally intractable valuation problem, using costly computation to learn some hidden parameters, and results for auctions and bargaining games in this model. 7.",
                "FUTURE DIRECTIONS Efficiently finding Nash equilibria in Socratic games with non-strategically zero-sum worlds is probably difficult because the existence of such an algorithm for classical games has been shown to be unlikely [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55].",
                "There has, however, been some algorithmic success in finding Nash equilibria in restricted classical settings (e.g., [21, 46, 47, 57]); we might hope to extend our results to analogous Socratic games.",
                "An efficient algorithm to find correlated equilibria in general Socratic games seems more attainable.",
                "Suppose the players receive recommended queries and responses.",
                "The difficulty is that when a player considers a deviation from his recommended query, he already knows his recommended response in each of the Stage-2 games.",
                "In a correlated equilibrium, a players expected payoff generally depends on his recommended strategy, and thus a player may deviate in Stage 1 so as to land in a Stage-2 game where he has been given a better than average recommended response. (Socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type, so Papadimitrious results [56] do not imply correlated equilibria for them.)",
                "Socratic games can be extended to allow players to make adaptive queries, choosing subsequent queries based on previous results.",
                "Our techniques carry over to O(1) rounds of unobservable queries, but it would be interesting to compute equilibria in Socratic games with adaptive observable queries or with ω(1) rounds of unobservable queries.",
                "Special cases of adaptive Socratic games are closely related to single-agent problems like minimum latency [1, 7, 26], determining strategies for using priced information [9, 29, 37], and an online version of minimum test cover [18, 50].",
                "Although there are important technical distinctions between adaptive Socratic games and these problems, approximation techniques from this literature may apply to Socratic games.",
                "The question of approximation raises interesting questions even in non-adaptive Socratic games.",
                "An -approximate Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile α so that no player can increase her payoff by an additive by deviating from α.",
                "Finding approximate Nash equilibria in both adaptive and non-adaptive Socratic games is an interesting direction to pursue.",
                "Another natural extension is the model where query results are stochastic.",
                "In this paper, we model a query as deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into subsets that the query cannot distinguish.",
                "However, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals.",
                "With this modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds.",
                "Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.",
                "It is also interesting to consider settings in which the games queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions. (For example, one might consider a setting in which the algorithm has only a sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki.)",
                "Efficiently finding equilibria in such settings remains an open problem.",
                "Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries.",
                "Here we take the query cost to be a linear function, so that δ(q) = P γ∈q δ({γ}).",
                "Natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my opponent is playing strategy aii, would I prefer to play ai or ˆai? ), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if I play strategy ai? ), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ W the real world?).",
                "When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions. (For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)",
                "Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy.",
                "Thus even computing a best response for Player I is hard. (This proof proceeds by reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, Player I must fully identify the actual world through his queries.",
                "Selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries is hard.)",
                "Computing Player Is best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14].",
                "An interesting open question is whether this approximate best-response calculation can be leveraged to find an approximate Nash equilibrium. 8.",

                "Partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) are a general framework used in AI to model situations of multi-agent planning in an evolving, unknown environment, but the generality of POSGs seems to make them very difficult [6].",
                "Recent work has been done in developing algorithms for restricted classes of POSGs, most notably classes of cooperative POSGs-e.g., [20, 30]-which are very different from the competitive strategically zero-sum games we address in this paper.",
                "The fundamental question in Socratic games is deciding on the comparative value of making a more costly but more informative query, or concluding the data-gathering phase and picking the best option, given current information.",
                "This tradeoff has been explored in a variety of other contexts; a sampling of these contexts includes aggregating results 156 from delay-prone information sources [8], doing approximate reasoning in intelligent systems [72], deciding when to take the current best guess of disease diagnosis from a beliefpropagation network and when to let it continue inference [33], among many others.",
                "This issue can also be viewed as another perspective on the general question of exploration versus exploitation that arises often in AI: when is it better to actively seek additional information instead of exploiting the knowledge one already has? (See, e.g., [69].)",
                "Most of this work differs significantly from our own in that it considers single-agent planning as opposed to the game-theoretic setting.",
                "A notable exception is the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44] on mechanism design for interacting agents whose computation is costly and limited.",
                "They present a model in which players must solve a computationally intractable valuation problem, using costly computation to learn some hidden parameters, and results for auctions and bargaining games in this model. 7.",
                "FUTURE DIRECTIONS Efficiently finding Nash equilibria in Socratic games with non-strategically zero-sum worlds is probably difficult because the existence of such an algorithm for classical games has been shown to be unlikely [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55].",
                "There has, however, been some algorithmic success in finding Nash equilibria in restricted classical settings (e.g., [21, 46, 47, 57]); we might hope to extend our results to analogous Socratic games.",
                "An efficient algorithm to find correlated equilibria in general Socratic games seems more attainable.",
                "Suppose the players receive recommended queries and responses.",
                "The difficulty is that when a player considers a deviation from his recommended query, he already knows his recommended response in each of the Stage-2 games.",
                "In a correlated equilibrium, a players expected payoff generally depends on his recommended strategy, and thus a player may deviate in Stage 1 so as to land in a Stage-2 game where he has been given a better than average recommended response. (Socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type, so Papadimitrious results [56] do not imply correlated equilibria for them.)",
                "Socratic games can be extended to allow players to make adaptive queries, choosing subsequent queries based on previous results.",
                "Our techniques carry over to O(1) rounds of unobservable queries, but it would be interesting to compute equilibria in Socratic games with adaptive observable queries or with ω(1) rounds of unobservable queries.",
                "Special cases of adaptive Socratic games are closely related to single-agent problems like minimum latency [1, 7, 26], determining strategies for using priced information [9, 29, 37], and an online version of minimum test cover [18, 50].",
                "Although there are important technical distinctions between adaptive Socratic games and these problems, approximation techniques from this literature may apply to Socratic games.",
                "The question of approximation raises interesting questions even in non-adaptive Socratic games.",
                "An -approximate Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile α so that no player can increase her payoff by an additive by deviating from α.",
                "Finding approximate Nash equilibria in both adaptive and non-adaptive Socratic games is an interesting direction to pursue.",
                "Another natural extension is the model where query results are stochastic.",
                "In this paper, we model a query as deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into subsets that the query cannot distinguish.",
                "However, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals.",
                "With this modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds.",
                "Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.",
                "It is also interesting to consider settings in which the games queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions. (For example, one might consider a setting in which the algorithm has only a sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki.)",
                "Efficiently finding equilibria in such settings remains an open problem.",
                "Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries.",
                "Here we take the query cost to be a linear function, so that δ(q) = P γ∈q δ({γ}).",
                "Natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my opponent is playing strategy aii, would I prefer to play ai or ˆai? ), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if I play strategy ai? ), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ W the real world?).",
                "When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions. (For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)",
                "Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy.",
                "Thus even computing a best response for Player I is hard. (This proof proceeds by reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, Player I must fully identify the actual world through his queries.",
                "Selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries is hard.)",
                "Computing Player Is best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14].",
                "An interesting open question is whether this approximate best-response calculation can be leveraged to find an approximate Nash equilibrium. 8.",

                "In this paper, we model a query as deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into subsets that the query cannot distinguish.",
                "However, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals.",
                "With this modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds.",
                "Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.",
                "It is also interesting to consider settings in which the games queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions. (For example, one might consider a setting in which the algorithm has only a sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki.)",
                "Efficiently finding equilibria in such settings remains an open problem.",
                "Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries.",
                "Here we take the query cost to be a linear function, so that δ(q) = P γ∈q δ({γ}).",
                "Natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my opponent is playing strategy aii, would I prefer to play ai or ˆai? ), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if I play strategy ai? ), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ W the real world?).",
                "When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions. (For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)",
                "Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy.",
                "Thus even computing a best response for Player I is hard. (This proof proceeds by reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, Player I must fully identify the actual world through his queries.",
                "Selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries is hard.)",
                "Computing Player Is best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14].",
                "An interesting open question is whether this approximate best-response calculation can be leveraged to find an approximate Nash equilibrium. 8.",

                "Compared to traditional game theory, the distinguishing feature of our model is the introduction of explicit costs to the players for learning arbitrary partial information about which of the many possible worlds is the real world.",
                "Our research was initially inspired by recent results in psychology on decision making, but it soon became clear that Socratic game theory is also a general tool for understanding the exploitation versus exploration tradeoff, well studied in machine learning, in a strategic multiplayer environment.",

                "This approach contrasts with traditional game theory, in which players are usually modeled as having fixed, exogenously given information about the structure of the game and its payoffs. (In traditional games of incomplete and imperfect information, there is information that the players do not have; in Socratic games, unlike in these games, the players have a chance to acquire the missing information, at some cost.)",
                "A number of related models have been explored by economists and computer scientists motivated by similar situations, often with a focus on mechanism design and auctions; a sampling of this research includes the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44], Parkes [59], Fong [22], Compte and Jehiel [12], Rezende [63], Persico and Matthews [48, 60], Cr´emer and Khalil [15], Rasmusen [62], and Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5].",

                "Finally each player selects an action and receives a payoff-a function of the players selected actions and the identity of the real world-less the cost of the query that he or she made.",
                "Compared to traditional game theory, the distinguishing feature of our model is the introduction of explicit costs to the players for learning arbitrary partial information about which of the many possible worlds is the real world.",
                "Our research was initially inspired by recent results in psychology on decision making, but it soon became clear that Socratic game theory is also a general tool for understanding the exploitation versus exploration tradeoff, well studied in machine learning, in a strategic multiplayer environment.",

                "We consider Socratic games under two models: an unobservable-query model where players learn only the response to their own queries and an observable-query model where players also learn which queries their opponents made.",
                "We give efficient algorithms to find Nash equilibriai.e., tuples of strategies from which no player has unilateral incentive to deviate-in broad classes of two-player Socratic games in both models.",
                "Our first result is an efficient algorithm to find Nash equilibria in unobservable-query Socratic games with constant-sum worlds, in which the sum of the players payoffs is independent of their actions.",
                "Our techniques also yield Nash equilibria in unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds.",
                "Strategically zero-sum games generalize constant-sum games by allowing the sum of the players payoffs to depend on individual players choices of strategy, but not on any interaction of their choices.",

                "Finally, we give an efficient algorithm to find correlated equilibria-a weaker but increasingly well-studied solution concept for games [2, 3, 32, 56, 57]-in observable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds.",
                "Like all games, Socratic games can be viewed as a special case of extensive-form games, which represent games by trees in which internal nodes represent choices made by chance or by the players, and the leaves represent outcomes that correspond to a vector of payoffs to the players.",
                "Algorithmically, the generality of extensive-form games makes them difficult to solve efficiently, and the special cases that are known to be efficiently solvable do not include even simple Socratic games.",
                "Every (complete-information) classical game is a trivial Socratic game (with a single possible world and a single trivial query), and efficiently finding Nash equilibria in classical games has been shown to be hard [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55].",
                "Therefore we would not expect to find a straightforward polynomial-time algorithm to compute Nash equilibria in general Socratic games.",
                "However, it is well known that Nash equilibria can be found efficiently via an LP for two-player constant-sum games [49, 71] (and strategically zero-sum games [51]).",
                "A Socratic game is itself a classical game, so one might hope that these results can be applied to Socratic games with constant-sum (or strategically zero-sum) worlds.",
                "We face two major obstacles in extending these classical results to Socratic games.",
                "First, a Socratic game with constant-sum worlds is not itself a constant-sum classical game-rather, the resulting classical game is only strategically zero sum.",
                "Worse yet, a Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds is not itself classically strategically zero sum-indeed, there are no known efficient algorithmic techniques to compute Nash equilibria in the resulting class of classical games.

(Socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type, so Papadimitrious results [56] do not imply correlated equilibria for them.)",

                "Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries.",

                "Natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my opponent is playing strategy aii, would I prefer to play ai or ˆai? ), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if I play strategy ai? ), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ W the real world?).",
                "When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions. (For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)",
                "Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy.",

                "First, a Socratic game with constant-sum worlds is not itself a constant-sum classical game-rather, the resulting classical game is only strategically zero sum.",

(Exponential-time algorithms like Lemke/Howson, of course, can be used [45].)",
                "Thus even when it is easy to find Nash equilibria in each of the worlds of a Socratic game, we require new techniques to solve the Socratic game itself.",
                "Second, even when the Socratic game itself is strategically zero sum, the number of possible strategies available to each player is exponential in the natural representation of the game.",

                "For unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds, we address these obstacles by formulating a new LP that uses only polynomially many variables (though still an exponential number of constraints) and then use ellipsoid-based techniques to solve it.",
                "For observablequery Socratic games, we handle the exponentiality by decomposing the game into stages, solving the stages separately, and showing how to reassemble the solutions efficiently.",

                "Thus we can use <br>algorithm</br> BNE to compute a Bayesian Nash equilibrium hq,BNE := BNE(Gstage2(q)) for each q ∈ Q, by Theorem 5.3.",
                "Furthermore, again by Lemma 5.2, the induced Stage-1 game GBNE stage1 is classical strategically zero sum.",
                "Therefore we can again use <br>algorithm</br> BNE to compute a Nash equilibrium α := BNE(GBNE stage1), again by Theorem 5.3.",
                "Therefore, by Lemma 5.1, we can assemble α and the hq,BNE s into a Nash equilibrium for the Socratic game G. 155 We would like to extend our results on observable-query Socratic games to Socratic games with strategically zerosum worlds.",
                "While we can still find Nash equilibria in the Stage-2 games, the resulting Stage-1 game is not in general strategically zero sum.",
                "Thus, finding Nash equilibria in observable-query Socratic games with strategically zerosum worlds seems to require substantially new techniques.",
                "However, our techniques for decomposing observable-query Socratic games do allow us to find correlated equilibria in this case.",
                "Lemma 5.5.",
                "Consider an observable-query Socratic game G = A, W, u, S, Q, p, δ .",
                "Let alg be an arbitrary <br>algorithm</br> that finds a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in each of the derived Stage-2 games Gstage2(q), and let Galg stage1 be the derived Stage1 game.",
                "Let φ be a correlated equilibrium for Galg stage1, and let hq,alg := alg(Gstage2(q)) be a Bayesian Nash equilibrium for each Gstage2(q).",
                "Then the following distribution over pure strategies is a correlated equilibrium for G: ψ(q, f) := φ(q) Y i∈{i,ii} Y s∈S Pr h fi(q, s) ← hq,alg i (s) i .",
                "Thus to find a correlated equilibrium in an observable-query Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds, we need only <br>algorithm</br> BNE from Theorem 5.3 along with an efficient <br>algorithm</br> for finding a correlated equilibrium in a general game.",
                "Such an <br>algorithm</br> exists (the definition of correlated equilibria can be directly translated into an LP [3]), and therefore we have the following theorem: Theorem 5.6.",
                "We can provide both efficient oracle access and efficient sampling access to a correlated equilibrium for any observable-query two-player Socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds.",
                "Because the support of the correlated equilibrium may be exponentially large, providing oracle and sampling access is the natural way to represent the correlated equilibrium.",
                "By Lemma 5.5, we can also compute correlated equilibria in any observable-query Socratic game for which Nash equilibria are computable in the induced Gstage2(q) games (e.g., when Gstage2(q) is of constant size).",
                "Another potentially interesting model of queries in Socratic games is what one might call public queries, in which both the choice and outcome of a players query is observable by all players in the game. (This model might be most appropriate in the presence of corporate espionage or media leaks, or in a setting in which the queries-and thus their results-are done in plain view.)",
                "The techniques that we have developed in this section also yield exactly the same results as for observable queries.",
                "The proof is actually simpler: with public queries, the players payoffs are common knowledge when Stage 2 begins, and thus Stage 2 really is a complete-information game. (There may still be uncertainty about the real world, but all players use the observed signals to infer exactly the same set of possible worlds in which wreal may lie; thus they are playing a complete-information game against each other.)",
                "Thus we have the same results as in Theorems 5.4 and 5.6 more simply, by solving Stage 2 using a (non-Bayesian) Nash-equilibrium finder and solving Stage 1 as before.",
                "Our results for observable queries are weaker than for unobservable: in Socratic games with worlds that are strategically zero sum but not constant sum, we find only a correlated equilibrium in the observable case, whereas we find a Nash equilibrium in the unobservable case.",
                "We might hope to extend our unobservable-query techniques to observable queries, but there is no obvious way to do so.",
                "The fundamental obstacle is that the LPs payoff constraint becomes nonlinear if there is any dependence on the probability that the other player made a particular query.",
                "This dependence arises with observable queries, suggesting that observable Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds may be harder to solve. 6.",
                "RELATED WORK Our work was initially motivated by research in the social sciences indicating that real people seem (irrationally) paralyzed when they are presented with additional options.",
                "In this section, we briefly review some of these social-science experiments and then discuss technical approaches related to Socratic game theory.",
                "Prima facie, a rational agents happiness given an added option can only increase.",
                "However, recent research has found that more choices tend to decrease happiness: for example, students choosing among extra-credit options are more likely to do extra credit if given a small subset of the choices and, moreover, produce higher-quality work [35]. (See also [19].)",
                "The psychology literature explores a number of explanations: people may miscalculate their opportunity cost by comparing their choice to a component-wise maximum of all other options instead of the single best alternative [65], a new option may draw undue attention to aspects of the other options [67], and so on.",
                "The present work explores an economic explanation of this phenomenon: information is not free.",
                "When there are more options, a decision-maker must spend more time to achieve a satisfactory outcome.",
                "See, e.g., the work of Skyrms [68] for a philosophical perspective on the role of deliberation in strategic situations.",
                "Finally, we note the connection between Socratic games and modal logic [34], a formalism for the logic of possibility and necessity.",
                "The observation that human players typically do not play rational strategies has inspired some attempts to model partially rational players.",
                "The typical model of this socalled bounded rationality [36, 64, 66] is to postulate bounds on computational power in computing the consequences of a strategy.",
                "The work on bounded rationality [23, 24, 53, 58] differs from the models that we consider here in that instead of putting hard limitations on the computational power of the agents, we instead restrict their a priori knowledge of the state of the world, requiring them to spend time (and therefore money/utility) to learn about it.",
                "Partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) are a general framework used in AI to model situations of multi-agent planning in an evolving, unknown environment, but the generality of POSGs seems to make them very difficult [6].",
                "Recent work has been done in developing algorithms for restricted classes of POSGs, most notably classes of cooperative POSGs-e.g., [20, 30]-which are very different from the competitive strategically zero-sum games we address in this paper.",
                "The fundamental question in Socratic games is deciding on the comparative value of making a more costly but more informative query, or concluding the data-gathering phase and picking the best option, given current information.",
                "This tradeoff has been explored in a variety of other contexts; a sampling of these contexts includes aggregating results 156 from delay-prone information sources [8], doing approximate reasoning in intelligent systems [72], deciding when to take the current best guess of disease diagnosis from a beliefpropagation network and when to let it continue inference [33], among many others.",
                "This issue can also be viewed as another perspective on the general question of exploration versus exploitation that arises often in AI: when is it better to actively seek additional information instead of exploiting the knowledge one already has? (See, e.g., [69].)",
                "Most of this work differs significantly from our own in that it considers single-agent planning as opposed to the game-theoretic setting.",
                "A notable exception is the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44] on mechanism design for interacting agents whose computation is costly and limited.",
                "They present a model in which players must solve a computationally intractable valuation problem, using costly computation to learn some hidden parameters, and results for auctions and bargaining games in this model. 7.",
                "FUTURE DIRECTIONS Efficiently finding Nash equilibria in Socratic games with non-strategically zero-sum worlds is probably difficult because the existence of such an <br>algorithm</br> for classical games has been shown to be unlikely [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55].",
                "There has, however, been some algorithmic success in finding Nash equilibria in restricted classical settings (e.g., [21, 46, 47, 57]); we might hope to extend our results to analogous Socratic games.",
                "An efficient <br>algorithm</br> to find correlated equilibria in general Socratic games seems more attainable.",
                "Suppose the players receive recommended queries and responses.",
                "The difficulty is that when a player considers a deviation from his recommended query, he already knows his recommended response in each of the Stage-2 games.",
                "In a correlated equilibrium, a players expected payoff generally depends on his recommended strategy, and thus a player may deviate in Stage 1 so as to land in a Stage-2 game where he has been given a better than average recommended response. (Socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type, so Papadimitrious results [56] do not imply correlated equilibria for them.)",
                "Socratic games can be extended to allow players to make adaptive queries, choosing subsequent queries based on previous results.",
                "Our techniques carry over to O(1) rounds of unobservable queries, but it would be interesting to compute equilibria in Socratic games with adaptive observable queries or with ω(1) rounds of unobservable queries.",
                "Special cases of adaptive Socratic games are closely related to single-agent problems like minimum latency [1, 7, 26], determining strategies for using priced information [9, 29, 37], and an online version of minimum test cover [18, 50].",
                "Although there are important technical distinctions between adaptive Socratic games and these problems, approximation techniques from this literature may apply to Socratic games.",
                "The question of approximation raises interesting questions even in non-adaptive Socratic games.",
                "An -approximate Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile α so that no player can increase her payoff by an additive by deviating from α.",
                "Finding approximate Nash equilibria in both adaptive and non-adaptive Socratic games is an interesting direction to pursue.",
                "Another natural extension is the model where query results are stochastic.",
                "In this paper, we model a query as deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into subsets that the query cannot distinguish.",
                "However, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals.",
                "With this modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds.",
                "Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.",
                "It is also interesting to consider settings in which the games queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions. (For example, one might consider a setting in which the <br>algorithm</br> has only a sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki.)",
                "Efficiently finding equilibria in such settings remains an open problem.",
                "Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries.",
                "Here we take the query cost to be a linear function, so that δ(q) = P γ∈q δ({γ}).",
                "Natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my opponent is playing strategy aii, would I prefer to play ai or ˆai? ), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if I play strategy ai? ), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ W the real world?).",
                "When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions. (For example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ Γ has δ({γ}) = Ω(M − M), where M and M denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)",
                "Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy.",
                "Thus even computing a best response for Player I is hard. (This proof proceeds by reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, Player I must fully identify the actual world through his queries.",
                "Selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries is hard.)",
                "Computing Player Is best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14].",
