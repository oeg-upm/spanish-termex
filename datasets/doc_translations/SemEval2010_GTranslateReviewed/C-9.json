Hauck Distributed Systems Laboratory University of Ulm franz.hauck@uni-ulm.de ABSTRACT As the idea of virtualisation of compute power, storage and bandwidth becomes more and more important, grid computing evolves and is applied to a rising number of applications. The environment for decentralized adaptive services (EDAS) provides a grid-like infrastructure for user-accessed, longterm services (e.g. webserver, source-code repository etc.). It aims at supporting the autonomous execution and evolution of services in terms of scalability and resource-aware distribution. EDAS offers flexible service models based on distributed mobile objects ranging from a traditional clientserver scenario to a fully peer-to-peer based approach. Automatic, dynamic resource management allows optimized use of available resources while minimizing the administrative complexity.

INTRODUCTION Infrastructures for grid computing aim at virtualizing a group of computers, servers, and storage as one large computing system. Resource management is a key issue in such systems, needed for an efficient and automated distribution of tasks on the grid. Such grid infrastructures are often deployed at enterprise level, but projects like SETI@home [1] have demonstrated the feasibility of more decentralized grids as well. Current grid computing infrastructures dont provide sufficient support for the execution of distributed, useraccessed, long-term services as they are designed to solve compute- or data-intensive tasks with a more or less fixed set of parameters. The common three-phase approach of resource discovery, system selection and job execution fails for services that change their resource demand over time due to interactive user access and run for a long period of time. Instead an infrastructure for long-term services has to place services based on their current demand and their estimated future requirements. If the distribution turns out to be wrong (e.g. a node gets overloaded) the service has to be migrated within the grid (e.g. to a more powerful and less loaded node). Migration however is expensive as the whole state of a service has to be transfered. Additionally a non-replicated service is not accessible during migration. Therefore the resource management has to avoid migration if possible. Furthermore a service concept has to be provided that evades overload in the first place, and secondly inhibits service unavailability if migration cant be avoided. EDAS [2] aims at providing a grid-like infrastructure for user-accessed, long-term services that allows the dynamic adaptation at run-time, provides a management infrastructure, and offers system-level support for scalability and fault tolerance. Nodes can dynamically join and leave the infrastructure, and all management tasks, especially the resource management, are decentralized. The environment is built upon our AspectIX [3] middleware infrastructure, which directly supports QoS-based, dynamic reconfiguration of services. The resource management focuses on the execution of services that have a long, potentially infinite, operating time. Theses services are organized in projects. Each project has a distributed execution scope called a service environment. Such an environment possibly spans multiple institutions. Each institution represents an administrative domain that can support a project with a fixed set of resources. Our approach supports the adaptive resource management of all projects in scope of an institution based on an algorithm inspired by the diffusive algorithms for decentralized loadbalancing [4]. It is not known how to optimally subdivide these resources for the services as the resource demand of services can change over time or even frequently fluctuate. To provide resources as needed, our approach automatically rededicates evenly free or not needed resources between service instances across projects and nodes. The whole process Article 5 of rededication is scalable as it is decentralized and respects certain limits like the physically available resources of a node and the amount of resources dedicated to a project. In cases where rededication is not possible, the migration of the demanding service is initiated. EDAS further supports flexible service models, including a fully centralized client/server structure, completely peer-topeer based systems, and various configurations in between that allow a controlled use of peer resources based on the fragmented object model [5]. The overall goal is to provide a generic service architecture that allows to implement the service functionality once, and then, ideally, run this service with different service models and adapt it at run-time, thereby scaling from a single user local instance to a multidomain-spanning scalable service. To reduce the implementation effort of such services a framework has been developed that supports the run-time evolution from a traditional client/server scenario to an active replicated server with clients interacting in a hybrid peer-to-peer architecture as known from Napster. In a longterm-service grid infrastructure, active replication has various benefits: Replicas can join and leave the object group and therefore replicas can be migrated without service unavailability. Load of non-modifying requests can be evenly distributed across the replicas making overload situations less likely. Finally a certain amount of node crashes can be tolerated. The following section describes the used features of AspectIX followed by a brief overview of the core components and concepts of EDAS. Section 4 explains the self-managing and rededication concepts of distributed adaptive resource management. Section 5 describes the framework for decentralized adaptive services. Section 6 describes related work and finally Section 7 concludes the paper. 2. BASIC MIDDLEWARE The EDAS environment is based on the AspectIX middleware. At its core, it provides a CORBA-compliant ORB and, as such, supports heterogeneous distributed systems. Furthermore AspectIX supports the fragmented object model [5] that is used to implement and provide decentralized adaptive services. In the fragmented object model, the distinction between client stubs and the server object is no longer present (Fig. 1). From an abstract point of view, a fragmented object is a unit with unique identity, interface, behavior, and state, like in classic object-oriented design. The implementation of these properties however is not bound to a specific location, but may be distributed arbitrarily on various fragments. Any client that wants to access the fragmented object needs a local fragment, which provides an interface identical to that of a traditional stub. However internal distribution and interaction is not only transparent on the outer interface of the distributed object, but may even change dynamically at runtime. This allows the fragmented object model to adapt to changing environment conditions or quality of service requirements. It offers to change the service model on demand from traditional client-server to a peer-to-peer based approach and all kind of intermediate stages by migration and exchanging of fragments. 3. EDAS CORE COMPONENTS Figure 1: Fragmented object on three nodes EDAS has three major components: Every node that actively supports decentralized adaptive services provides a home environment. The home environment basically manages resources of one or more nodes belonging to the same administrative domain or institution. The service environment is spread over a set of domains that support a certain project and relies on basic services from the corresponding home environments. The service environment supports the execution of services belonging to the same project. Finally, the decentralized adaptive service is dynamically distributed within the scope of an associated service environment. The home environment has the role of a mediator between the nodes of an institution and one or more service environments, each running a set of services. Fig. 2 shows three domains each running a home environment that spans all nodes of the respective domains. Every node provides a set of resources. Each domain has a manager who can use that home environment to assign resources to service environments and to revoke them. Apart from providing system load and all kinds of resource-usage information to the service environment, the home environment also notifies about all important system events like a node shutdown or crash. A service environment represents a scope of distribution for one or more services. Usually, a service environment is owned by one organization or community and dedicated to one project. A service manager can start, stop, and configure services through the interface of the service environment and decides which resources provided by home environments are accepted. In most cases a service environment is spread over more than one administrative domain as shown in Fig. 2. One of the main tasks of the service environment is to support the migration of services or service components especially between different home environments. The service environment thereby takes available resources, the requirements of the services, and the policies provided by the service manager into account. The migration of service components can be necessary for various reasons, like node shutdown, resource constraints, and the growth or shrinkage of a service environment. 4. DECENTRALIZED RESOURCEMANAGEMENT Resource management for long-term services has other requirements than resource management in common grid computing environments. For instance even in the context of traditional grid systems it is very difficult to determine or even only estimate the resource requirements of a task [6]. For long-term services this is even harder, and it is likely that the resource demand frequently changes. This turns Article 5 Host FHost D Host E Host A Host C Service Environment Service B Service A Home Env. Home Environment Home Environment Boundary of the fragmented object Service Manager Domain Manager Domain Manager Figure 2: EDAS Scenario the optimal distribution of services over a set of nodes into a difficult problem. In general the migration of services is a prerequisite of EDAS as it offers a solution if the initial distribution decision was wrong (e.g. initial start of previously unknown service) or the demand of services has changed substantially. But migration is costly, since the whole state of a service possibly including program code has to be transfered. If the service is not replicated it will be unavailable during migration. Taking this into account a resource management should place services and adaptively rededicate resources between services and nodes as needed to prevent migration. As EDAS aims at providing a grid-like infrastructure for a large set of nodes that can join and leave the system all resource management tasks have to be decentralized to be scalable and should not require global knowledge. The resource management can be structured into the following different tasks: • Adding and changing the assigned resources of a service environment • Automatic placement of service at startup time and during migration due to overload • Keeping all kind of resource limits, especially the limits of service environments • Compensate leaving and crashed nodes In the next sections we will describe what kind of resource limits there are and how to do resource management based on these basic conditions. 4.1 Resource Limits Our approach manages resources on two stages, the node level and the service-environment level. At the node level we monitor usage of all kind of physical resources like disk space, memory, CPU and network bandwidth but also logical ones like open files, sockets and threads. The entity of monitoring is a service or a service component in case of a decentralized adaptive service. Every service has so called local limits that restrict the resource usage in context of the current node. If a service runs the risk of exceeding such a local limit the home environment tries to extend the limits or notifies the responsible service environment if rededication is not possible. Reaching a local limit can be caused by two reasons: an overloaded node or an overloaded service environment. In the first case service migration might help, in the second case migration to another administrative domain might be an option, or simply reducing resource demand by stopping the service. Of course there could be more than one service of the same service environment at a node. Therefore the assigned resources of a service environment at a node can be easily computed by summing up all local limits of its services. Furthermore each node has node limits that restrict the overall usage of certain resources. A node limit must never exceed the physical resource (e.g. disk space) of a node and might be much smaller, e.g., for supporting local users. The sum of all local limits at a node must never exceed the node limit of a resource. Therefore observing and controlling the local limits will keep the node limits and preventing overload. NodeLimitNode ≥ numberOfLocalLimitsNodeX i=1 LocalLimiti At the institution level the resource usage of a service environment and its associated services is also restricted by so-called global limits. These limits determine the maximum resource usage of a project in scope of a home environment. The sum of all local limits on all nodes of the institution for a certain project therefore never exceeds its global limit. GlobaleLimitSE ≥ numberOfLocalLimitsSEX i=1 LocalLimiti 4.2 Adaptive Resource Rededication We start with a straight-forward implementation to describe the principal workflow. Then we propose an approach for a more efficient solution and discuss its problems. If a new project should be supported by a home environment it is first necessary to identify the nodes that offer sufficient unassigned resources to start a service. This can be achieved in a naive implementation by using a flooding approach like it is done by the Gnutella protocol assuming the nodes are connected in a random graph. These resources then can be assigned to the service environment of the new project which further on can start services on these nodes. Of course a home environment supports usually numerous projects. Each of these projects has resource shares on various nodes, some of them occupied by services, other free and unused. As the resource demand of a service changes it might be possible that a service reaches its local limit if the service is under high demand. What happens next depends on the overall resource usage of the service environment and the resource consumption at the local node. If the service environment has not reached its global limit and the node is not overloaded the dependent local limit of the service should be extended simply by reducing a local limit at another node of the same service environment. When all resources of the node are assigned to other service environments there are two possibilities. All resources are used by services, so we have to migrate a service, or the resources are assigned but not used. In the later case we shall rededicate resources and assign them to the demanding service environment. Finally the service environment might have reached its global limit. In this case the resource consumption has to be reduced either by migrating the service to another domain and its depended home environment or simply by bounding resource usage and if this is not possible, stopping the service. In contrary to the setup of a new service environment which is not time critical and a less frequent task the adaptation of local limits occurs frequently and needs to be done Article 5 almost immediately. Thus it is not an option to use broadcast searches for rededication. Instead a more efficient approach with a bounded complexity is necessary. The same applies for detecting if a global limit is reached by a service environment. Currently we investigate if this can be achieved by using a diffusive algorithm[4] like it is used for decentralized load balancing. Thereby all nodes of a system are partitioned in groups that overlap partially. The union of all groups achieves a full coverage. Group members frequently exchange load information and balance the load by migration. In our case we aim not at balancing the load but the amount of available free resources of a service environment. Each node that supports a certain service environment is at least connected to another node that supports the same project. This way it always should be known if a service environment has still enough resources and therefore if a service can grow. There still remain open issues like if the diffusively balanced free resources should be tightly connected to the real resources, comparable to reservations. In this case there might be problems if a node supports several service environments which all have services running at the node and a node limit is exceeded which would require service migration. In fact it can be needless as the services might not use all the assigned resources but the diffusive algorithm caused the limit overrun by equally balancing the free resources of all supported service environments. If we remove the mapping between free resources and real resources of a node we can evade these situations. However it gets more complicated to determine the free and unassigned resources of a home environment. 4.3 Placement of Services Independent of the mapping of free resources the placement of a service is, as already stated, a difficult problem. Distributing the services equally over all nodes would surely prevent migration in the average case even if resource demand of services changes. However if the resource demand of services varies highly and the grid is clogged by many projects it might be that a service cant be placed because the free resources are too scattered. A different approach would be to consider it as an variant of the bin-packing problem that aims at packing items in bins by optimizing the number of used bins. In our case we need an online approach as the items are not known in advance and we have a multi-dimensional problem since a service has various resource requirements. The number of bins is bounded as we have a finite number of nodes in our grid. An algorithm for this problem has recently been proposed by Epstein and van Stee in [7]. On the downside this algorithm needs to know all nodes and their actual usage. As the placement of a service is not a time critical problem again a flooding based approach might offer a solution. To reduce the number of answers only nodes that provide sufficient resources need to reply. It has also to be considered to transform the algorithm to a distributed one. Another problem might be that the algorithm optimizes the occupancy too strong. Therefore demand changes of service can lead to overloaded nodes and causing migration. We believe this can be prevented by not only considering the actual resource consumption to determine the resource demand of a service but taking the previous demand into account. 5. DECENTRALIZED ADAPTIVE SERVICE MODEL In EDAS a decentralized, adaptive service normally matches a traditional service accessed by users like a web server, an instant messaging server or a source code repository. Such a service is represented by a fragmented object. This object expands or shrinks in the scope spanned by the associated service environment depending on the service demands and for fault-tolerance reasons. Usually every part of the object is mobile and can be migrated if necessary. Each service has at least two interfaces: one for management tasks and another service specific for the end user. The management interface offers methods to start, stop, and configure service instances. As this set of features requires an enormous implementation effort to do it anew for each service implementation we support the development of decentralized adaptive services through a framework and an extended version of IDL in combination with a special IDL-compiler [8]. The core idea is to develop a service in usual client/server fashion as it is done in plain CORBA. This service then can be started and executed on the grid as a common servant. Additionally it should be possible to migrate the service. This can be achieved by using value type based approach to describe the service state as done in [9] or using the language supplied serialization mechanisms. As we would like to tolerate node crashes and the service should be available during migration we support the active replication of the service. This is achieved by generating special client-side stubs that communicate with one of the replicas. To keep the connection between clients and the replicated object we use time-bounded references [10] that restrict the migration but make the usage of location services (to cope with outdate references) obsolete. The replicas are synchronized via a group communication framework. The IDL extension consists of additional modifiers that affect code generation for client and server side. These are retain to mark non-modifying operations which allows faster responses and load balancing of those requests. Furthermore one can mark methods as local which indicates that they can be locally processed. In this case the IDLcompiler creates placeholder for local execution. Apart form methods that are usual static this is useful to implement client-side contribution and interaction. For example if a client-stub offers a method which results in a file transfer it is possible to integrate a custom protocol that forwards a modified request to the replicated object which returns not the file as in the common case but URLs that point to clients that previously requested the file. Now the clientstub fetches the data from the offered location and responds as if it was supplied by the server object. This peer-to-peer based behavior as known from Napster is transparent to the client and can be switched on and off depending on environment conditions like load and community as needed. Finally we provide another modifier to mark administrative operations. If a method is marked with admin an authentication is necessary. The method to authenticate is pluggable and might be by pass-phrase, internet address or any other authentication scheme. This modifier facilitates the creation of service management methods. Article 5 6. RELATED WORK Grid infrastructures like the Globus-Toolkit [11] provide services and mechanisms for distributed heterogeneous environments to combine resources on demand to solve resource consuming and compute intensive tasks. Due to this orientation they focus on different service models, provide no support for object mobility if even supporting a distributed object approach at all. But most important they follow a different resource management approach as they target the parallel execution of a large number of short and midterm tasks. JavaSymphony [12] and Ibis [13] provide object mobility but are limited to the Java programming language and focus on object oriented high performance computing. Actively replicated objects are provided by Jgroup [14] based on RMI. On top of this basic middleware a replication management layer has been implemented called ARM [15]. JGroup focus on the active replication of objects but lacks support for more flexible services like EDAS does. ARM can be compared to EDAS but supports no resource aware distribution. Fog [16] and Globe [17] are basic middleware environments that support the fragmented object approach. Globe considers replication and caching. Both systems lack support for resource aware distribution. 7. CONCLUSION AND ONGOING WORK Based on the fragmented object model and the architecture of the EDAS environment, decentralized adaptive services can be easily designed, implemented and executed. As described the resource management can be decomposed in two main problems that have to be solved. Controlling and managing of resource limits including ensuring that the assigned resources are available (even in the context of node crashes) and the autonomous placement of services. For both problems we offer a solution, a currently implemented simulation environment will verify their feasibility. In a next step the resource management will be integrate in an already implemented prototype of the EDAS architecture. As described we have already an early implementation of the framework for the decentralized adaptive services. This framework has to be extended to smoothly interact with the resource management and the EDAS architecture. In a final step we need to implement some services that verify the usability of the whole EDAS project. 8. REFERENCES [1] D. Werthimer S. Bowyer J. Cobb D. Gedye D. Anderson W. T. Sullivan, III.

INTRODUCCIÓN Infraestructuras para la computación de la cuadrícula Apunte a virtualizar un grupo de computadoras, servidores y almacenamiento como un gran sistema informático. La gestión de recursos es un problema clave en tales sistemas, necesarios para una distribución eficiente y automatizada de tareas en la red. Dichas infraestructuras de cuadrícula a menudo se implementan a nivel empresarial, pero proyectos como Seti@Home [1] también han demostrado la viabilidad de las redes más descentralizadas. Las infraestructuras de computación de la cuadrícula actuales no proporcionan un soporte suficiente para la ejecución de servicios distribuidos, usamentados y a largo plazo, ya que están diseñados para resolver tareas de computación o información intensiva con un conjunto de parámetros más o menos fijo. El enfoque trifásico común del descubrimiento de recursos, la selección del sistema y la ejecución del trabajo falla por los servicios que cambian su demanda de recursos con el tiempo debido al acceso interactivo a los usuarios y se ejecutan durante un largo período de tiempo. En cambio, una infraestructura para los servicios a largo plazo debe colocar los servicios en función de su demanda actual y sus requisitos futuros estimados. Si la distribución resulta ser incorrecta (por ejemplo, un nodo se sobrecarga), el servicio debe migrarse dentro de la cuadrícula (por ejemplo, a un nodo más potente y menos cargado). Sin embargo, la migración es costosa ya que todo el estado de un servicio debe transferirse. Además, no es accesible un servicio no replicado durante la migración. Por lo tanto, la gestión de recursos debe evitar la migración si es posible. Además, se debe proporcionar un concepto de servicio que evade la sobrecarga en primer lugar, e inhibe en segundo lugar la falta de disponibilidad del servicio si la migración no se puede evitar. EDAS [2] tiene como objetivo proporcionar una infraestructura similar a la red para servicios a largo plazo de acceso a los usuarios que permite la adaptación dinámica en tiempo de ejecución, proporciona una infraestructura de gestión y ofrece soporte a nivel de sistema para la escalabilidad y la tolerancia a las fallas. Los nodos pueden unirse dinámicamente y abandonar la infraestructura, y todas las tareas de gestión, especialmente la gestión de recursos, están descentralizadas. El entorno se basa en nuestra infraestructura de middleware Suppectix [3], que admite directamente la reconfiguración dinámica de servicios basada en QoS. La gestión de recursos se centra en la ejecución de servicios que tienen un tiempo de funcionamiento largo y potencialmente infinito. Estos servicios están organizados en proyectos. Cada proyecto tiene un alcance de ejecución distribuido llamado entorno de servicio. Tal entorno posiblemente abarca múltiples instituciones. Cada institución representa un dominio administrativo que puede respaldar un proyecto con un conjunto fijo de recursos. Nuestro enfoque respalda la gestión de recursos adaptativos de todos los proyectos en el alcance de una institución basada en un algoritmo inspirado en los algoritmos difusivos para el balance de carga descentralizado [4]. No se sabe cómo subdividir de manera óptima estos recursos para los servicios, ya que la demanda de recursos de los servicios puede cambiar con el tiempo o incluso fluctuar con frecuencia. Para proporcionar recursos según sea necesario, nuestro enfoque rededica automáticamente los recursos de manera uniforme o no necesaria entre las instancias de servicio en los proyectos y nodos. Todo el Artículo 5 del proceso de rededicación es escalable, ya que está descentralizado y respeta ciertos límites como los recursos físicamente disponibles de un nodo y la cantidad de recursos dedicados a un proyecto. En los casos en que la rededicación no es posible, se inicia la migración del servicio exigente. EDAS admite aún más modelos de servicio flexibles, incluida una estructura de cliente/servidor totalmente centralizada, sistemas basados en el tope por pares y varias configuraciones entre los que permiten un uso controlado de recursos de pares basados en el modelo de objeto fragmentado [5]. El objetivo general es proporcionar una arquitectura de servicio genérico que permita implementar la funcionalidad del servicio una vez, y luego, idealmente, ejecutar este servicio con diferentes modelos de servicio y adaptarla en tiempo de ejecución, lo que amplía de una sola instancia local de usuario a una mulidominio.-Spanning Scalable Service. Para reducir el esfuerzo de implementación de dichos servicios, se ha desarrollado un marco que admite la evolución del tiempo de ejecución de un escenario tradicional de cliente/servidor a un servidor replicado activo con clientes que interactúan en una arquitectura híbrida de pares a igual como se conoce desde Napster. En una infraestructura de cuadrícula de servicio a largo plazo, la replicación activa tiene varios beneficios: las réplicas pueden unirse y dejar el grupo de objetos y, por lo tanto, las réplicas se pueden migrar sin falta de disponibilidad del servicio. La carga de solicitudes no modificadoras se puede distribuir uniformemente a través de las réplicas, lo que hace que las situaciones de sobrecarga sean menos probables. Finalmente, se puede tolerar una cierta cantidad de bloqueos de nodo. La siguiente sección describe las características utilizadas de Suppeix seguidas de una breve descripción de los componentes y conceptos centrales de EDAS. La Sección 4 explica los conceptos de autogestión y rededicación de la gestión distribuida de recursos adaptativos. La Sección 5 describe el marco para los servicios adaptativos descentralizados. La Sección 6 describe el trabajo relacionado y finalmente la Sección 7 concluye el documento.2. Middleware básico El entorno EDAS se basa en el middleware de Suppeix. En esencia, proporciona un orbe compatible con Corba y, como tal, admite sistemas distribuidos heterogéneos. Además, Suppeix admite el modelo de objetos fragmentado [5] que se utiliza para implementar y proporcionar servicios adaptativos descentralizados. En el modelo de objeto fragmentado, la distinción entre los trozos del cliente y el objeto del servidor ya no está presente (Fig. 1). Desde un punto de vista abstracto, un objeto fragmentado es una unidad con identidad, interfaz, comportamiento y estado únicos, como en el diseño clásico orientado a objetos. Sin embargo, la implementación de estas propiedades no está vinculada a una ubicación específica, sino que puede distribuirse arbitrariamente en varios fragmentos. Cualquier cliente que desee acceder al objeto fragmentado necesita un fragmento local, que proporciona una interfaz idéntica a la de un trozo tradicional. Sin embargo, la distribución e interacción interna no solo es transparente en la interfaz externa del objeto distribuido, sino que incluso puede cambiar dinámicamente en tiempo de ejecución. Esto permite que el modelo de objeto fragmentado se adapte a las condiciones de entorno cambiante o los requisitos de calidad de servicio. Ofrece cambiar el modelo de servicio a pedido del servidor de cliente tradicional a un enfoque de pares a igual y todo tipo de etapas intermedias mediante la migración e intercambio de fragmentos.3. Componentes centrales de EDAS Figura 1: Objeto fragmentado en tres nodos EDAS tiene tres componentes principales: cada nodo que admite activamente servicios adaptativos descentralizados proporciona un entorno de inicio. El entorno del hogar básicamente administra los recursos de uno o más nodos que pertenecen al mismo dominio o institución administrativa. El entorno de servicio se extiende sobre un conjunto de dominios que respaldan un determinado proyecto y se basan en los servicios básicos de los entornos domésticos correspondientes. El entorno de servicio admite la ejecución de servicios que pertenecen al mismo proyecto. Finalmente, el servicio adaptativo descentralizado se distribuye dinámicamente dentro del alcance de un entorno de servicio asociado. El entorno del hogar tiene el papel de un mediador entre los nodos de una institución y uno o más entornos de servicio, cada uno con un conjunto de servicios. La figura 2 muestra tres dominios, cada uno con un entorno doméstico que abarca todos los nodos de los dominios respectivos. Cada nodo proporciona un conjunto de recursos. Cada dominio tiene un gerente que puede usar ese entorno doméstico para asignar recursos a entornos de servicio y revocarlos. Además de proporcionar carga del sistema y todo tipo de información de uso de recursos al entorno de servicio, el entorno doméstico también notifica sobre todos los eventos importantes del sistema como un cierre o bloqueo de nodo. Un entorno de servicio representa un alcance de distribución para uno o más servicios. Por lo general, un entorno de servicio es propiedad de una organización o comunidad y se dedica a un proyecto. Un administrador de servicios puede iniciar, detener y configurar servicios a través de la interfaz del entorno de servicio y decidir qué recursos proporcionados por los entornos domésticos son aceptados. En la mayoría de los casos, un entorno de servicio se extiende en más de un dominio administrativo como se muestra en la figura 2. Una de las principales tareas del entorno de servicio es apoyar la migración de servicios o componentes de servicios, especialmente entre diferentes entornos de hogar. El entorno de servicio tiene en cuenta los recursos disponibles, los requisitos de los servicios y las políticas proporcionadas por el Gerente de Servicios. La migración de componentes de servicio puede ser necesaria por varias razones, como el cierre de nodos, las limitaciones de recursos y el crecimiento o la contracción de un entorno de servicio.4. La gestión descentralizada de recursos de gestión de recursos para servicios a largo plazo tiene otros requisitos que la gestión de recursos en entornos de computación de la red comunes. Por ejemplo, incluso en el contexto de los sistemas de cuadrícula tradicionales, es muy difícil determinar o incluso estimar los requisitos de recursos de una tarea [6]. Para los servicios a largo plazo, esto es aún más difícil, y es probable que la demanda de recursos cambie con frecuencia. Esto se convierte en el artículo 5 Host Fhost D Host E Host A Host C Servicio Servicio Servicio B Servicio A Home Env. Entorno de inicio entorno de inicio límite del fragmentado Administrador de dominios de Service Manager Domain Manager Figura 2: Escenario EDAS La distribución óptima de los servicios sobre un conjunto de nodos en un problema difícil. En general, la migración de servicios es un requisito previo de EDAS, ya que ofrece una solución si la decisión de distribución inicial fue incorrecta (por ejemplo, inicio inicial del servicio previamente desconocido) o la demanda de servicios ha cambiado sustancialmente. Pero la migración es costosa, ya que todo el estado de un servicio posiblemente incluye el código del programa debe transferirse. Si el servicio no se replica, no estará disponible durante la migración. Teniendo esto en cuenta, una gestión de recursos debe colocar los servicios y redindicar los recursos de forma adaptativa entre los servicios y los nodos según sea necesario para evitar la migración. Como EDAS tiene como objetivo proporcionar una infraestructura similar a la red para un gran conjunto de nodos que pueden unirse y dejar el sistema, todas las tareas de gestión de recursos deben descentralizarse para ser escalables y no deben requerir conocimiento global. La gestión de recursos se puede estructurar en las siguientes tareas diferentes: • Agregar y cambiar los recursos asignados de un entorno de servicio • Colocación automática del servicio en el momento de inicio y durante la migración debido a la sobrecarga • Mantener todo tipo de límites de recursos, especialmente los límites de servicioentornos • Compensar los nodos de salida y bloqueados En las siguientes secciones, describiremos qué tipo de límites de recursos hay y cómo hacer la gestión de recursos en función de estas condiciones básicas.4.1 Límites de recursos Nuestro enfoque gestiona los recursos en dos etapas, el nivel de nodo y el nivel de servicio-medio ambiente. En el nivel de nodo, monitoreamos el uso de todo tipo de recursos físicos, como espacio en disco, memoria, CPU y ancho de banda de red, pero también lógicos, como archivos abiertos, sockets e hilos. La entidad del monitoreo es un servicio o un componente de servicio en caso de un servicio adaptativo descentralizado. Cada servicio ha llamado límites locales que restringen el uso de recursos en el contexto del nodo actual. Si un servicio corre el riesgo de exceder el límite local de este tipo, el entorno doméstico intenta extender los límites o notifica el entorno de servicio responsable si la rededicación no es posible. Alcanzar un límite local puede ser causado por dos razones: un nodo sobrecargado o un entorno de servicio sobrecargado. En el primer caso, la migración del servicio podría ayudar, en el segundo caso, la migración a otro dominio administrativo podría ser una opción, o simplemente reducir la demanda de recursos al detener el servicio. Por supuesto, podría haber más de un servicio del mismo entorno de servicio en un nodo. Por lo tanto, los recursos asignados de un entorno de servicio en un nodo se pueden calcular fácilmente sumando todos los límites locales de sus servicios. Además, cada nodo tiene límites de nodo que restringen el uso general de ciertos recursos. Un límite de nodo nunca debe exceder el recurso físico (por ejemplo, espacio en disco) de un nodo y podría ser mucho más pequeño, por ejemplo, para apoyar a los usuarios locales. La suma de todos los límites locales en un nodo nunca debe exceder el límite de nodo de un recurso. Por lo tanto, observar y controlar los límites locales mantendrá los límites del nodo y evitan la sobrecarga. NodelimitNode ≥ NumberOfLocallImitsNodex I = 1 Locallimiti a nivel de la institución El uso de recursos de un entorno de servicio y sus servicios asociados también está restringido por los llamados límites globales. Estos límites determinan el uso máximo de recursos de un proyecto en el alcance de un entorno doméstico. La suma de todos los límites locales en todos los nodos de la institución para un determinado proyecto, por lo tanto, nunca excede su límite global. GlobalElimitse ≥ NumberOfLOCALLIMITSSEX I = 1 Locallimiti 4.2 Rededicación de recursos adaptativos Comenzamos con una implementación directa para describir el flujo de trabajo principal. Luego proponemos un enfoque para una solución más eficiente y discutimos sus problemas. Si un nuevo proyecto debe ser respaldado por un entorno de origen, primero es necesario identificar los nodos que ofrecen suficientes recursos no asignados para comenzar un servicio. Esto se puede lograr en una implementación ingenua utilizando un enfoque de inundación como el protocolo Gnutella, suponiendo que los nodos estén conectados en un gráfico aleatorio. Estos recursos se pueden asignar al entorno de servicio del nuevo proyecto que puede iniciar servicios en estos nodos. Por supuesto, un entorno domiciliario admite generalmente numerosos proyectos. Cada uno de estos proyectos tiene acciones de recursos en varios nodos, algunos de ellos ocupados por servicios, otros libres y no utilizados. A medida que la demanda de recursos de un servicio cambia, podría ser posible que un servicio alcance su límite local si el servicio está bajo una alta demanda. Lo que sucede a continuación depende del uso general de recursos del entorno de servicio y del consumo de recursos en el nodo local. Si el entorno de servicio no ha alcanzado su límite global y el nodo no está sobrecargado, el límite local dependiente del servicio debe extenderse simplemente reduciendo un límite local en otro nodo del mismo entorno de servicio. Cuando todos los recursos del nodo se asignan a otros entornos de servicio, hay dos posibilidades. Todos los recursos son utilizados por los servicios, por lo que tenemos que migrar un servicio o los recursos están asignados pero no utilizados. En el caso posterior, rededicaremos los recursos y los asignaremos al entorno de servicio exigente. Finalmente, el entorno de servicio podría haber alcanzado su límite global. En este caso, el consumo de recursos debe reducirse ya sea migrando el servicio a otro dominio y su entorno de inicio dependiendo o simplemente mediante el uso de recursos y si esto no es posible, detenga el servicio. A diferencia de la configuración de un nuevo entorno de servicio que no es crítico y una tarea menos frecuente, la adaptación de los límites locales ocurre con frecuencia y debe hacerse el artículo 5 casi de inmediato. Por lo tanto, no es una opción usar búsquedas de transmisión para la rededicación. En cambio, es necesario un enfoque más eficiente con una complejidad limitada. Lo mismo se aplica para detectar si un entorno de servicio alcanza un límite global. Actualmente investigamos si esto se puede lograr utilizando un algoritmo difusivo [4] como se usa para el equilibrio de carga descentralizada. De este modo, todos los nodos de un sistema se dividen en grupos que se superponen parcialmente. La unión de todos los grupos logra una cobertura completa. Los miembros del grupo frecuentemente intercambian información de carga y equilibran la carga por migración. En nuestro caso, apuntamos no a equilibrar la carga, sino la cantidad de recursos gratuitos disponibles de un entorno de servicio. Cada nodo que admite un determinado entorno de servicio está al menos conectado a otro nodo que admite el mismo proyecto. De esta manera, siempre debe saber si un entorno de servicio todavía tiene suficientes recursos y, por lo tanto, si un servicio puede crecer. Todavía quedan problemas abiertos, como si los recursos libres difusivamente equilibrados deberían estar estrechamente conectados con los recursos reales, comparables a las reservas. En este caso, puede haber problemas si un nodo admite varios entornos de servicio que tienen servicios que se ejecutan en el nodo y se excede un límite de nodo que requeriría la migración del servicio. De hecho, puede ser innecesario ya que los servicios pueden no usar todos los recursos asignados, pero el algoritmo difusivo causó el límite invadido al equilibrar igualmente los recursos gratuitos de todos los entornos de servicio admitidos. Si eliminamos el mapeo entre recursos gratuitos y recursos reales de un nodo, podemos evadir estas situaciones. Sin embargo, se vuelve más complicado determinar los recursos gratuitos y no asignados de un entorno doméstico.4.3 Colocación de servicios independientemente del mapeo de recursos gratuitos La colocación de un servicio es, como ya se dijo, un problema difícil. Distribuir los servicios por igual en todos los nodos seguramente evitaría la migración en el caso promedio, incluso si la demanda de recursos de los servicios cambia. Sin embargo, si la demanda de recursos de servicios varía mucho y la red está obstruida por muchos proyectos, podría ser que un servicio no se pueda colocar porque los recursos gratuitos están demasiado dispersos. Un enfoque diferente sería considerarlo como una variante del problema de llenado de contenedores que tiene como objetivo empacar elementos en los contenedores optimizando el número de contenedores usados. En nuestro caso, necesitamos un enfoque en línea ya que los elementos no se conocen de antemano y tenemos un problema multidimensional ya que un servicio tiene varios requisitos de recursos. El número de contenedores está limitado ya que tenemos un número finito de nodos en nuestra cuadrícula. Epstein y Van Stee en [7] han propuesto un algoritmo para este problema en [7]. En el lado negativo, este algoritmo necesita conocer todos los nodos y su uso real. Como la colocación de un servicio no es un problema crítico de tiempo nuevamente, un enfoque basado en inundaciones podría ofrecer una solución. Para reducir el número de respuestas, solo los nodos que proporcionan recursos suficientes deben responder. También debe considerarse para transformar el algoritmo en uno distribuido. Otro problema podría ser que el algoritmo optimiza la ocupación demasiado fuerte. Por lo tanto, los cambios en la demanda de servicio pueden conducir a nodos sobrecargados y causar migración. Creemos que esto puede evitarse no solo considerando el consumo de recursos real para determinar la demanda de recursos de un servicio, sino teniendo en cuenta la demanda anterior.5. Modelo de servicio adaptativo descentralizado en EDAS Un servicio adaptativo descentralizado normalmente coincide con un servicio tradicional accedido por usuarios como un servidor web, un servidor de mensajería instantánea o un repositorio de código fuente. Tal servicio está representado por un objeto fragmentado. Este objeto se expande o se reduce en el alcance abarcado por el entorno de servicio asociado dependiendo de las demandas del servicio y por razones de tolerancia a fallas. Por lo general, cada parte del objeto es móvil y se puede migrar si es necesario. Cada servicio tiene al menos dos interfaces: una para tareas de gestión y otro servicio específico para el usuario final. La interfaz de administración ofrece métodos para iniciar, detener y configurar instancias de servicio. Como este conjunto de características requiere un enorme esfuerzo de implementación para hacerlo de nuevo para cada implementación del servicio, apoyamos el desarrollo de servicios adaptativos descentralizados a través de un marco y una versión extendida de IDL en combinación con un compilador especial de IDL [8]. La idea principal es desarrollar un servicio de manera habitual del cliente/servidor como se hace en Plain Corba. Este servicio se puede iniciar y ejecutar en la cuadrícula como un sirviente común. Además, debería ser posible migrar el servicio. Esto se puede lograr utilizando un enfoque basado en el tipo de valor para describir el estado del servicio como se hace en [9] o utilizando los mecanismos de serialización suministrados por el lenguaje. Como nos gustaría tolerar los bloqueos de nodo y el servicio debería estar disponible durante la migración, admitimos la replicación activa del servicio. Esto se logra generando trozos especiales del lado del cliente que se comunican con una de las réplicas. Para mantener la conexión entre los clientes y el objeto replicado, utilizamos referencias limitadas por el tiempo [10] que restringen la migración, pero hacen que el uso de los servicios de ubicación (para hacer frente a las referencias anticuadas) sea obsoleto. Las réplicas se sincronizan a través de un marco de comunicación grupal. La extensión IDL consta de modificadores adicionales que afectan la generación de código para el lado del cliente y el servidor. Estos se retienen para marcar operaciones no modificadoras, lo que permite respuestas más rápidas y el equilibrio de carga de esas solicitudes. Además, uno puede marcar métodos como locales, lo que indica que pueden procesarse localmente. En este caso, el IDLCompiler crea un marcador de posición para la ejecución local. Aparte de los métodos de formulario que son habituales estáticos Esto es útil para implementar la contribución e interacción del lado del cliente. Por ejemplo, si un stub Client ofrece un método que da como resultado una transferencia de archivos, es posible integrar un protocolo personalizado que reenvíe una solicitud modificada al objeto replicado que devuelve no el archivo como en el caso común, pero las URL que apuntan a los clientes quepreviamente solicitó el archivo. Ahora el ClientStub obtiene los datos de la ubicación ofrecida y responde como si fuera suministrado por el objeto del servidor. Este comportamiento basado en igual por igual que se conoce en Napster es transparente para el cliente y se puede encender y desactivar dependiendo de las condiciones del entorno como la carga y la comunidad según sea necesario. Finalmente proporcionamos otro modificador para marcar operaciones administrativas. Si un método está marcado con Admin, es necesario una autenticación. El método para autenticarse es conectable y podría ser por frase de aprobación, dirección de Internet o cualquier otro esquema de autenticación. Este modificador facilita la creación de métodos de gestión de servicios. Artículo 5 6. Las infraestructuras de la red de trabajo relacionada como Globus-Toolkit [11] proporcionan servicios y mecanismos para entornos heterogéneos distribuidos para combinar recursos a pedido para resolver el consumo de recursos y calcular tareas intensivas. Debido a esta orientación, se centran en diferentes modelos de servicio, no proporcionan soporte para la movilidad de los objetos si incluso admite un enfoque de objeto distribuido. Pero lo más importante sigue un enfoque de gestión de recursos diferente a medida que se dirigen a la ejecución paralela de una gran cantidad de tareas a corto y medio plazo. Javasymfony [12] e IBI [13] proporcionan movilidad de objetos, pero se limitan al lenguaje de programación Java y se centran en la computación de alto rendimiento orientada a objetos. Los objetos replicados activamente son proporcionados por JGroup [14] basados en RMI. Además de este middleware básico, se ha implementado una capa de administración de replicación llamada ARM [15]. JGroup se enfoca en la replicación activa de los objetos, pero carece de soporte para servicios más flexibles como lo hace EDAS. ARM se puede comparar con EDAS, pero no admite distribución de recursos conscientes. Fog [16] y Globe [17] son entornos de middleware básicos que admiten el enfoque de objetos fragmentados. Globe considera la replicación y el almacenamiento en caché. Ambos sistemas carecen de soporte para la distribución consciente de los recursos.7. Conclusión y trabajo continuo basado en el modelo de objetos fragmentado y la arquitectura del entorno EDAS, los servicios adaptativos descentralizados se pueden diseñar, implementar y ejecutar fácilmente. Como se describe, la gestión de recursos puede descomponerse en dos problemas principales que deben resolverse. Control y gestión de límites de recursos, incluida la garantía de que los recursos asignados estén disponibles (incluso en el contexto de los bloqueos de nodos) y la colocación autónoma de los servicios. Para ambos problemas ofrecemos una solución, un entorno de simulación implementado actualmente verificará su viabilidad. En el siguiente paso, la gestión de recursos se integrará en un prototipo ya implementado de la arquitectura EDAS. Como se describe, ya tenemos una implementación temprana del marco para los servicios adaptativos descentralizados. Este marco debe extenderse para interactuar sin problemas con la gestión de recursos y la arquitectura EDAS. En un paso final necesitamos implementar algunos servicios que verifiquen la usabilidad de todo el proyecto EDAS.8. Referencias [1] D. Werthimer S. Bowyer J. Cobb D. Gedye D. Anderson W. T.

        "Each domain has a manager who can use that home environment to assign resources to service environments and to revoke them.",
        "Apart from providing system load and all kinds of resource-usage information to the service environment, the home environment also notifies about all important system events like a node shutdown or crash.",

        "One of the main tasks of the service environment is to support the migration of services or service components especially between different home environments.",
        "The service environment thereby takes available resources, the requirements of the services, and the policies provided by the service manager into account.",

        "DECENTRALIZED RESOURCEMANAGEMENT Resource management for long-term services has other requirements than resource management in common grid computing environments.",
        "For instance even in the context of traditional grid systems it is very difficult to determine or even only estimate the resource requirements of a task [6].",
        "For long-term services this is even harder, and it is likely that the resource demand frequently changes.",

        "Reaching a local limit can be caused by two reasons: an overloaded node or an overloaded service environment.",
        "In the first case service migration might help, in the second case migration to another administrative domain might be an option, or simply reducing resource demand by stopping the service.",
        "Of course there could be more than one service of the same service environment at a node.",
        "Therefore the assigned resources of a service environment at a node can be easily computed by summing up all local limits of its services.",
        "Furthermore each node has node limits that restrict the overall usage of certain resources.",
        "A node limit must never exceed the physical resource (e.g. disk space) of a node and might be much smaller, e.g., for supporting local users.",
        "The sum of all local limits at a node must never exceed the node limit of a resource.",
        "Therefore observing and controlling the local limits will keep the node limits and preventing overload.",
        "NodeLimitNode ≥ numberOfLocalLimitsNodeX i=1 LocalLimiti At the institution level the resource usage of a service environment and its associated services is also restricted by so-called global limits.",
        "These limits determine the maximum resource usage of a project in scope of a home environment.",
        "The sum of all local limits on all nodes of the institution for a certain project therefore never exceeds its global limit.",
        "GlobaleLimitSE ≥ numberOfLocalLimitsSEX i=1 LocalLimiti 4.2 Adaptive Resource Rededication We start with a straight-forward implementation to describe the principal workflow.",
        "Then we propose an approach for a more efficient solution and discuss its problems.",
        "If a new project should be supported by a home environment it is first necessary to identify the nodes that offer sufficient unassigned resources to start a service.",
        "This can be achieved in a naive implementation by using a flooding approach like it is done by the Gnutella protocol assuming the nodes are connected in a random graph.",
        "These resources then can be assigned to the service environment of the new project which further on can start services on these nodes.",
        "Of course a home environment supports usually numerous projects.",
        "Each of these projects has resource shares on various nodes, some of them occupied by services, other free and unused.",
        "As the resource demand of a service changes it might be possible that a service reaches its local limit if the service is under high demand.",
        "What happens next depends on the overall resource usage of the service environment and the resource consumption at the local node.",
        "If the service environment has not reached its global limit and the node is not overloaded the dependent local limit of the service should be extended simply by reducing a local limit at another node of the same service environment.",
        "When all resources of the node are assigned to other service environments there are two possibilities.",
        "All resources are used by services, so we have to migrate a service, or the resources are assigned but not used.",
        "In the later case we shall rededicate resources and assign them to the demanding service environment.",
        "Finally the service environment might have reached its global limit.",
        "In this case the resource consumption has to be reduced either by migrating the service to another domain and its depended home environment or simply by bounding resource usage and if this is not possible, stopping the service.",
        "In contrary to the setup of a new service environment which is not time critical and a less frequent task the adaptation of local limits occurs frequently and needs to be done Article 5 almost immediately.",
        "Thus it is not an option to use broadcast searches for rededication.",
        "Instead a more efficient approach with a bounded complexity is necessary.",
        "The same applies for detecting if a global limit is reached by a service environment.",
        "Currently we investigate if this can be achieved by using a diffusive algorithm[4] like it is used for decentralized load balancing.",
        "Thereby all nodes of a system are partitioned in groups that overlap partially.",
        "The union of all groups achieves a full coverage.",
        "Group members frequently exchange load information and balance the load by migration.",
        "In our case we aim not at balancing the load but the amount of available free resources of a service environment.",
        "Each node that supports a certain service environment is at least connected to another node that supports the same project.",
        "This way it always should be known if a service environment has still enough resources and therefore if a service can grow.",
        "There still remain open issues like if the diffusively balanced free resources should be tightly connected to the real resources, comparable to reservations.",
        "In this case there might be problems if a node supports several service environments which all have services running at the node and a node limit is exceeded which would require service migration.",
        "In fact it can be needless as the services might not use all the assigned resources but the diffusive algorithm caused the limit overrun by equally balancing the free resources of all supported service environments.",
        "If we remove the mapping between free resources and real resources of a node we can evade these situations.",
        "However it gets more complicated to determine the free and unassigned resources of a home environment. 4.3 Placement of Services Independent of the mapping of free resources the placement of a service is, as already stated, a difficult problem.",
        "Distributing the services equally over all nodes would surely prevent migration in the average case even if resource demand of services changes.",
        "However if the resource demand of services varies highly and the grid is clogged by many projects it might be that a service cant be placed because the free resources are too scattered.",
        "A different approach would be to consider it as an variant of the bin-packing problem that aims at packing items in bins by optimizing the number of used bins.",
        "In our case we need an online approach as the items are not known in advance and we have a multi-dimensional problem since a service has various resource requirements.",
        "The number of bins is bounded as we have a finite number of nodes in our grid.",
        "An algorithm for this problem has recently been proposed by Epstein and van Stee in [7].",
        "On the downside this algorithm needs to know all nodes and their actual usage.",
        "As the placement of a service is not a time critical problem again a flooding based approach might offer a solution.",
        "To reduce the number of answers only nodes that provide sufficient resources need to reply.",
        "It has also to be considered to transform the algorithm to a distributed one.",
        "Another problem might be that the algorithm optimizes the occupancy too strong.",
        "Therefore demand changes of service can lead to overloaded nodes and causing migration.",
        "We believe this can be prevented by not only considering the actual resource consumption to determine the resource demand of a service but taking the previous demand into account. 5.",
        "DECENTRALIZED ADAPTIVE SERVICE MODEL In EDAS a decentralized, adaptive service normally matches a traditional service accessed by users like a web server, an instant messaging server or a source code repository.",
        "Such a service is represented by a fragmented object.",
        "This object expands or shrinks in the scope spanned by the associated service environment depending on the service demands and for fault-tolerance reasons.",
        "Usually every part of the object is mobile and can be migrated if necessary.",
        "Each service has at least two interfaces: one for management tasks and another service specific for the end user.",
        "The management interface offers methods to start, stop, and configure service instances.",
        "As this set of features requires an enormous implementation effort to do it anew for each service implementation we support the development of decentralized adaptive services through a framework and an extended version of IDL in combination with a special IDL-compiler [8].",
        "The core idea is to develop a service in usual client/server fashion as it is done in plain CORBA.",
        "This service then can be started and executed on the grid as a common servant.",
        "Additionally it should be possible to migrate the service.",
        "This can be achieved by using value type based approach to describe the service state as done in [9] or using the language supplied serialization mechanisms.",
        "As we would like to tolerate node crashes and the service should be available during migration we support the active replication of the service.",
        "This is achieved by generating special client-side stubs that communicate with one of the replicas.",
        "To keep the connection between clients and the replicated object we use time-bounded references [10] that restrict the migration but make the usage of location services (to cope with outdate references) obsolete.",
        "The replicas are synchronized via a group communication framework.",
        "The IDL extension consists of additional modifiers that affect code generation for client and server side.",
        "These are retain to mark non-modifying operations which allows faster responses and load balancing of those requests.",
        "Furthermore one can mark methods as local which indicates that they can be locally processed.",
        "In this case the IDLcompiler creates placeholder for local execution.",
        "Apart form methods that are usual static this is useful to implement client-side contribution and interaction.",
        "For example if a client-stub offers a method which results in a file transfer it is possible to integrate a custom protocol that forwards a modified request to the replicated object which returns not the file as in the common case but URLs that point to clients that previously requested the file.",
        "Now the clientstub fetches the data from the offered location and responds as if it was supplied by the server object.",
        "This peer-to-peer based behavior as known from Napster is transparent to the client and can be switched on and off depending on environment conditions like load and community as needed.",
        "Finally we provide another modifier to mark administrative operations.",
        "If a method is marked with admin an authentication is necessary.",
        "The method to authenticate is pluggable and might be by pass-phrase, internet address or any other authentication scheme.",
        "This modifier facilitates the creation of service management methods.",
        "Article 5 6.",
        "RELATED WORK Grid infrastructures like the Globus-Toolkit [11] provide services and mechanisms for distributed heterogeneous environments to combine resources on demand to solve resource consuming and compute intensive tasks.",
        "Due to this orientation they focus on different service models, provide no support for object mobility if even supporting a distributed object approach at all.",
        "But most important they follow a different resource management approach as they target the parallel execution of a large number of short and midterm tasks.",
        "JavaSymphony [12] and Ibis [13] provide object mobility but are limited to the Java programming language and focus on object oriented high performance computing.",
        "Actively replicated objects are provided by Jgroup [14] based on RMI.",
        "On top of this basic middleware a replication management layer has been implemented called ARM [15].",
        "JGroup focus on the active replication of objects but lacks support for more flexible services like EDAS does.",
        "ARM can be compared to EDAS but supports no resource aware distribution.",
        "Fog [16] and Globe [17] are basic middleware environments that support the fragmented object approach.",
        "Globe considers replication and caching.",
        "Both systems lack support for resource aware distribution. 7.",
        "CONCLUSION AND ONGOING WORK Based on the fragmented object model and the architecture of the EDAS environment, decentralized adaptive services can be easily designed, implemented and executed.",
        "As described the resource management can be decomposed in two main problems that have to be solved.",
        "Controlling and managing of resource limits including ensuring that the assigned resources are available (even in the context of node crashes) and the autonomous placement of services.",
        "For both problems we offer a solution, a currently implemented simulation environment will verify their feasibility.",
        "In a next step the resource management will be integrate in an already implemented prototype of the EDAS architecture.",
        "As described we have already an early implementation of the framework for the decentralized adaptive services.",
        "This framework has to be extended to smoothly interact with the resource management and the EDAS architecture.",
        "In a final step we need to implement some services that verify the usability of the whole EDAS project. 8.",

                "However it gets more complicated to determine the free and unassigned resources of a home environment. 4.3 Placement of Services Independent of the mapping of free resources the placement of a service is, as already stated, a difficult problem.",

                "For long-term services this is even harder, and it is likely that the resource demand frequently changes.",

                "In general the migration of services is a prerequisite of EDAS as it offers a solution if the initial distribution decision was wrong (e.g. initial start of previously unknown service) or the demand of services has changed substantially.",
                "But migration is costly, since the whole state of a service possibly including program code has to be transfered.",
                "If the service is not replicated it will be unavailable during migration.",
                "Taking this into account a resource management should place services and adaptively rededicate resources between services and nodes as needed to prevent migration.",
                "As EDAS aims at providing a grid-like infrastructure for a large set of nodes that can join and leave the system all resource management tasks have to be decentralized to be scalable and should not require global knowledge.",
                "The resource management can be structured into the following different tasks: • Adding and changing the assigned resources of a service environment • Automatic placement of service at startup time and during migration due to overload • Keeping all kind of resource limits, especially the limits of service environments • Compensate leaving and crashed nodes In the next sections we will describe what kind of resource limits there are and how to do resource management based on these basic conditions. 4.1 Resource Limits Our approach manages resources on two stages, the node level and the service-environment level.",
                "At the node level we monitor usage of all kind of physical resources like disk space, memory, CPU and network bandwidth but also logical ones like open files, sockets and threads.",
                "The entity of monitoring is a service or a service component in case of a decentralized adaptive service.",
                "Every service has so called local limits that restrict the resource usage in context of the current node.",
                "If a service runs the risk of exceeding such a local limit the home environment tries to extend the limits or notifies the responsible service environment if rededication is not possible.",
                "Reaching a local limit can be caused by two reasons: an overloaded node or an overloaded service environment.",
                "In the first case service migration might help, in the second case migration to another administrative domain might be an option, or simply reducing resource demand by stopping the service.",
                "Of course there could be more than one service of the same service environment at a node.",
                "Therefore the assigned resources of a service environment at a node can be easily computed by summing up all local limits of its services.",
                "Furthermore each node has node limits that restrict the overall usage of certain resources.",
                "A node limit must never exceed the physical resource (e.g. disk space) of a node and might be much smaller, e.g., for supporting local users.",
                "The sum of all local limits at a node must never exceed the node limit of a resource.",
                "Therefore observing and controlling the local limits will keep the node limits and preventing overload.",
                "NodeLimitNode ≥ numberOfLocalLimitsNodeX i=1 LocalLimiti At the institution level the resource usage of a service environment and its associated services is also restricted by so-called global limits.",
                "These limits determine the maximum resource usage of a project in scope of a home environment.",
                "The sum of all local limits on all nodes of the institution for a certain project therefore never exceeds its global limit.",
                "GlobaleLimitSE ≥ numberOfLocalLimitsSEX i=1 LocalLimiti 4.2 Adaptive Resource Rededication We start with a straight-forward implementation to describe the principal workflow.",
                "Then we propose an approach for a more efficient solution and discuss its problems.",
                "If a new project should be supported by a home environment it is first necessary to identify the nodes that offer sufficient unassigned resources to start a service.",
                "This can be achieved in a naive implementation by using a flooding approach like it is done by the Gnutella protocol assuming the nodes are connected in a random graph.",
                "These resources then can be assigned to the service environment of the new project which further on can start services on these nodes.",
                "Of course a home environment supports usually numerous projects.",
                "Each of these projects has resource shares on various nodes, some of them occupied by services, other free and unused.",
                "As the resource demand of a service changes it might be possible that a service reaches its local limit if the service is under high demand.",
                "What happens next depends on the overall resource usage of the service environment and the resource consumption at the local node.",
                "If the service environment has not reached its global limit and the node is not overloaded the dependent local limit of the service should be extended simply by reducing a local limit at another node of the same service environment.",
                "When all resources of the node are assigned to other service environments there are two possibilities.",
                "All resources are used by services, so we have to migrate a service, or the resources are assigned but not used.",
                "In the later case we shall rededicate resources and assign them to the demanding service environment.",
                "Finally the service environment might have reached its global limit.",
                "In this case the resource consumption has to be reduced either by migrating the service to another domain and its depended home environment or simply by bounding resource usage and if this is not possible, stopping the service.",
                "In contrary to the setup of a new service environment which is not time critical and a less frequent task the adaptation of local limits occurs frequently and needs to be done Article 5 almost immediately.",
                "Thus it is not an option to use broadcast searches for rededication.",
                "Instead a more efficient approach with a bounded complexity is necessary.",
                "The same applies for detecting if a global limit is reached by a service environment.",
                "Currently we investigate if this can be achieved by using a diffusive algorithm[4] like it is used for decentralized load balancing.",
                "Thereby all nodes of a system are partitioned in groups that overlap partially.",
                "The union of all groups achieves a full coverage.",
                "Group members frequently exchange load information and balance the load by migration.",
                "In our case we aim not at balancing the load but the amount of available free resources of a service environment.",
                "Each node that supports a certain service environment is at least connected to another node that supports the same project.",
                "This way it always should be known if a service environment has still enough resources and therefore if a service can grow.",
                "There still remain open issues like if the diffusively balanced free resources should be tightly connected to the real resources, comparable to reservations.",
                "In this case there might be problems if a node supports several service environments which all have services running at the node and a node limit is exceeded which would require service migration.",
                "In fact it can be needless as the services might not use all the assigned resources but the diffusive algorithm caused the limit overrun by equally balancing the free resources of all supported service environments.",
                "If we remove the mapping between free resources and real resources of a node we can evade these situations.",
                "However it gets more complicated to determine the free and unassigned resources of a home environment. 4.3 Placement of Services Independent of the mapping of free resources the placement of a service is, as already stated, a difficult problem.",
                "Distributing the services equally over all nodes would surely prevent migration in the average case even if resource demand of services changes.",
                "However if the resource demand of services varies highly and the grid is clogged by many projects it might be that a service cant be placed because the free resources are too scattered.",
                "A different approach would be to consider it as an variant of the bin-packing problem that aims at packing items in bins by optimizing the number of used bins.",
                "In our case we need an online approach as the items are not known in advance and we have a multi-dimensional problem since a service has various resource requirements.",
                "The number of bins is bounded as we have a finite number of nodes in our grid.",
                "An algorithm for this problem has recently been proposed by Epstein and van Stee in [7].",
                "On the downside this algorithm needs to know all nodes and their actual usage.",
                "As the placement of a service is not a time critical problem again a flooding based approach might offer a solution.",
                "To reduce the number of answers only nodes that provide sufficient resources need to reply.",
                "It has also to be considered to transform the algorithm to a distributed one.",
                "Another problem might be that the algorithm optimizes the occupancy too strong.",
                "Therefore demand changes of service can lead to overloaded nodes and causing migration.",
                "We believe this can be prevented by not only considering the actual resource consumption to determine the resource demand of a service but taking the previous demand into account. 5.",
                "DECENTRALIZED ADAPTIVE SERVICE MODEL In EDAS a decentralized, adaptive service normally matches a traditional service accessed by users like a web server, an instant messaging server or a source code repository.",
                "Such a service is represented by a fragmented object.",
                "This object expands or shrinks in the scope spanned by the associated service environment depending on the service demands and for fault-tolerance reasons.",
                "Usually every part of the object is mobile and can be migrated if necessary.",
                "Each service has at least two interfaces: one for management tasks and another service specific for the end user.",
                "The management interface offers methods to start, stop, and configure service instances.",
                "As this set of features requires an enormous implementation effort to do it anew for each service implementation we support the development of decentralized adaptive services through a framework and an extended version of IDL in combination with a special IDL-compiler [8].",
                "The core idea is to develop a service in usual client/server fashion as it is done in plain CORBA.",
                "This service then can be started and executed on the grid as a common servant.",
                "Additionally it should be possible to migrate the service.",
                "This can be achieved by using value type based approach to describe the service state as done in [9] or using the language supplied serialization mechanisms.",
                "As we would like to tolerate node crashes and the service should be available during migration we support the active replication of the service.",
                "This is achieved by generating special client-side stubs that communicate with one of the replicas.",
                "To keep the connection between clients and the replicated object we use time-bounded references [10] that restrict the migration but make the usage of location services (to cope with outdate references) obsolete.",
                "The replicas are synchronized via a group communication framework.",
                "The IDL extension consists of additional modifiers that affect code generation for client and server side.",
                "These are retain to mark non-modifying operations which allows faster responses and load balancing of those requests.",
                "Furthermore one can mark methods as local which indicates that they can be locally processed.",
                "In this case the IDLcompiler creates placeholder for local execution.",
                "Apart form methods that are usual static this is useful to implement client-side contribution and interaction.",
                "For example if a client-stub offers a method which results in a file transfer it is possible to integrate a custom protocol that forwards a modified request to the replicated object which returns not the file as in the common case but URLs that point to clients that previously requested the file.",
                "Now the clientstub fetches the data from the offered location and responds as if it was supplied by the server object.",
                "This peer-to-peer based behavior as known from Napster is transparent to the client and can be switched on and off depending on environment conditions like load and community as needed.",

                "In this case there might be problems if a node supports several service environments which all have services running at the node and a node limit is exceeded which would require service migration.",
                "In fact it can be needless as the services might not use all the assigned resources but the diffusive algorithm caused the limit overrun by equally balancing the free resources of all supported service environments.",
                "If we remove the mapping between free resources and real resources of a node we can evade these situations.",
                "However it gets more complicated to determine the free and unassigned resources of a home environment. 4.3 Placement of Services Independent of the mapping of free resources the placement of a service is, as already stated, a difficult problem.",
                "Distributing the services equally over all nodes would surely prevent migration in the average case even if <br>resource</br> demand of services changes.",
                "However if the <br>resource</br> demand of services varies highly and the grid is clogged by many projects it might be that a service cant be placed because the free resources are too scattered.",
                "A different approach would be to consider it as an variant of the bin-packing problem that aims at packing items in bins by optimizing the number of used bins.",
                "In our case we need an online approach as the items are not known in advance and we have a multi-dimensional problem since a service has various <br>resource</br> requirements.",

                "To reduce the number of answers only nodes that provide sufficient resources need to reply.",
                "It has also to be considered to transform the algorithm to a distributed one.",
                "Another problem might be that the algorithm optimizes the occupancy too strong.",
                "Therefore demand changes of service can lead to overloaded nodes and causing migration.",
                "We believe this can be prevented by not only considering the actual <br>resource</br> consumption to determine the <br>resource</br> demand of a service but taking the previous demand into account. 5.",

                "As this set of features requires an enormous implementation effort to do it anew for each service implementation we support the development of decentralized adaptive services through a framework and an extended version of IDL in combination with a special IDL-compiler [8].",

                "However it gets more complicated to determine the free and unassigned resources of a home environment. 4.3 Placement of Services Independent of the mapping of free resources the placement of a service is, as already stated, a difficult problem.",
