Slots for ad listings are allocated via an auction-style mechanism where the higher a merchant bids, the more likely his ad is to appear above other ads on the page. In this paper we analyze the incentive, efficiency, and revenue properties of two slot auction designs: rank by bid (RBB) and rank by revenue (RBR), which correspond to stylized versions of the mechanisms currently used by Yahoo! and Google, respectively. We also consider first- and second-price payment rules together with each of these allocation rules, as both have been used historically. We consider both the short-run incomplete information setting and the long-run complete information setting. With incomplete information, neither RBB nor RBR are truthful with either first or second pricing. We find that the informational requirements of RBB are much weaker than those of RBR, but that RBR is efficient whereas RBB is not. We also show that no revenue ranking of RBB and RBR is possible given an arbitrary distribution over bidder values and relevance. With complete information, we find that no equilibrium exists with first pricing using either RBB or RBR. We show that there typically exists a multitude of equilibria with second pricing, and we bound the divergence of (economic) value in such equilibria from the value obtained assuming all merchants bid truthfully.

INTRODUCTION Today, Internet giants Google and Yahoo! boast a combined market capitalization of over $150 billion, largely on the strength of sponsored search, the fastest growing component of a resurgent online advertising industry. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that 2004 industry-wide sponsored search revenues were $3.9 billion, or 40% of total Internet advertising revenues.1 Industry watchers expect 2005 revenues to reach or exceed $7 billion.2 Roughly 80% of Googles estimated $4 billion in 2005 revenue and roughly 45% of Yahoo!s estimated $3.7 billion in 2005 revenue will likely be attributable to sponsored search.3 A number of other companies-including LookSmart, FindWhat, InterActiveCorp (Ask Jeeves), and eBay (Shopping.com)-earn hundreds of millions of dollars of sponsored search revenue annually. Sponsored search is a form of advertising where merchants pay to appear alongside web search results. For example, when a user searches for used honda accord san diego in a web search engine, a variety of commercial entities (San Diego car dealers, Honda Corp, automobile information portals, classified ad aggregators, eBay, etc...) may bid to to have their listings featured alongside the standard algorithmic search listings. Advertisers bid for placement on the page in an auction-style format where the higher they bid the more likely their listing will appear above other ads on the page. By convention, sponsored search advertisers generally pay per click, meaning that they pay only when a user clicks on their ad, and do not pay if their ad is displayed but not clicked. Though many people claim to systematically ignore sponsored search ads, Majestic Research reports that 1 www.iab.net/resources/adrevenue/pdf/IAB PwC 2004full.pdf 2 battellemedia.com/archives/002032.php 3 These are rough back of the envelope estimates. Google and Yahoo! 2005 revenue estimates were obtained from Yahoo! Finance. We assumed $7 billion in 2005 industry-wide sponsored search revenues. We used Nielsen/NetRatings estimates of search engine market share in the US, the most monetized market: wired-vig.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,69291,00.html Using comScores international search engine market share estimates would yield different estimates: www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=622 218 as many as 17% of Google searches result in a paid click, and that Google earns roughly nine cents on average for every search query they process.4 Usually, sponsored search results appear in a separate section of the page designated as sponsored above or to the right of the algorithmic results. Sponsored search results are displayed in a format similar to algorithmic results: as a list of items each containing a title, a text description, and a hyperlink to a corresponding web page. We call each position in the list a slot. Generally, advertisements that appear in a higher ranked slot (higher on the page) garner more attention and more clicks from users. Thus, all else being equal, merchants generally prefer higher ranked slots to lower ranked slots. Merchants bid for placement next to particular search queries; for example, Orbitz and Travelocity may bid for las vegas hotel while Dell and HP bid for laptop computer. As mentioned, bids are expressed as a maximum willingness to pay per click. For example, a forty-cent bid by HostRocket for web hosting means HostRocket is willing to pay up to forty cents every time a user clicks on their ad.5 The auctioneer (the search engine6 ) evaluates the bids and allocates slots to advertisers. In principle, the allocation decision can be altered with each new incoming search query, so in effect new auctions clear continuously over time as search queries arrive. Many allocation rules are plausible. In this paper, we investigate two allocation rules, roughly corresponding to the two allocation rules used by Yahoo! and Google. The rank by bid (RBB) allocation assigns slots in order of bids, with higher ranked slots going to higher bidders. The rank by revenue (RBR) allocation assigns slots in order of the product of bid times expected relevance, where relevance is the proportion of users that click on the merchants ad after viewing it. In our model, we assume that an ads expected relevance is known to the auctioneer and the advertiser (but not necessarily to other advertisers), and that clickthrough rate decays monotonically with lower ranked slots. In practice, the expected clickthrough rate depends on a number of factors, including the position on the page, the ad text (which in turn depends on the identity of the bidder), the nature and intent of the user, and the context of other ads and algorithmic results on the page, and must be learned over time by both the auctioneer and the bidder [13]. As of this writing, to a rough first-order approximation, Yahoo! employs a RBB allocation and Google employs a RBR allocation, though numerous caveats apply in both cases when it comes to the vagaries of real-world implementations.7 Even when examining a one-shot version of a slot auction, the mechanism differs from a standard multi-item auc4 battellemedia.com/archives/001102.php 5 Usually advertisers also set daily or monthly budget caps; in this paper we do not model budget constraints. 6 In the sponsored search industry, the auctioneer and search engine are not always the same entity. For example Google runs the sponsored search ads for AOL web search, with revenue being shared. Similarly, Yahoo! currently runs the sponsored search ads for MSN web search, though Microsoft will begin independent operations soon. 7 Here are two among many exceptions to the Yahoo! = RBB and Google = RBR assertion: (1) Yahoo! excludes ads deemed insufficiently relevant either by a human editor or due to poor historical click rate; (2) Google sets differing reserve prices depending on Googles estimate of ad quality. tion in subtle ways. First, a single bid per merchant is used to allocate multiple non-identical slots. Second, the bid is communicated not as a direct preference over slots, but as a preference for clicks that depend stochastically on slot allocation. We investigate a number of economic properties of RBB and RBR slot auctions. We consider the short-run incomplete information case in Section 3, adapting and extending standard analyses of single-item auctions. In Section 4 we turn to the long-run complete information case; our characterization results here draw on techniques from linear programming. Throughout, important observations are highlighted as claims supported by examples. Our contributions are as follows: • We show that with multiple slots, bidders do not reveal their true values with either RBB or RBR, and with either first- or second-pricing. • With incomplete information, we find that the informational requirements of playing the equilibrium bid are much weaker for RBB than for RBR, because bidders need not know any information about each others relevance (or even their own) with RBB. • With incomplete information, we prove that RBR is efficient but that RBB is not. • We show via a simple example that no general revenue ranking of RBB and RBR is possible. • We prove that in a complete-information setting, firstprice slot auctions have no pure strategy Nash equilibrium, but that there always exists a pure-strategy equilibrium with second pricing. • We provide a constant-factor bound on the deviation from efficiency that can occur in the equilibrium of a second-price slot auction. In Section 2 we specify our model of bidders and the various slot auction formats. In Section 3.1 we study the incentive properties of each format, asking in which cases agents would bid truthfully. There is possible confusion here because the second-price design for slot auctions is reminiscent of the Vickrey auction for a single item; we note that for slot auctions the Vickrey mechanism is in fact very different from the second-price mechanism, and so they have different incentive properties.8 In Section 3.2 we derive the Bayes-Nash equilibrium bids for the various auction formats. This is useful for the efficiency and revenue results in later sections. It should become clear in this section that slot auctions in our model are a straightforward generalization of single-item auctions. Sections 3.3 and 3.4 address questions of efficiency and revenue under incomplete information, respectively. In Section 4.1 we determine whether pure-strategy equilibria exist for the various auction formats, under complete information. In Section 4.2 we derive bounds on the deviation from efficiency in the pure-strategy equilibria of secondprice slot auctions. Our approach is positive rather than normative. We aim to clarify the incentive, efficiency, and revenue properties of two slot auction designs currently in use, under settings of 8 Other authors have also made this observation [5, 6]. 219 incomplete and complete information. We do not attempt to derive the optimal mechanism for a slot auction. Related work. Feng et al. [7] compare the revenue performance of various ranking mechanisms for slot auctions in a model with incomplete information, much as we do in Section 3.4, but they obtain their results via simulations whereas we perform an equilibrium analysis. Liu and Chen [12] study properties of slot auctions under incomplete information. Their setting is essentially the same as ours, except they restrict their attention to a model with a single slot and a binary type for bidder relevance (high or low). They find that RBR is efficient, but that no general revenue ranking of RBB and RBR is possible, which agrees with our results. They also take a design approach and show how the auctioneer should assign relevance scores to optimize its revenue. Edelman et al. [6] model the slot auction problem both as a static game of complete information and a dynamic game of incomplete information. They study the locally envyfree equilibria of the static game of complete information; this is a solution concept motivated by certain bidding behaviors that arise due to the presence of budget constraints. They do not view slot auctions as static games of incomplete information as we do, but do study them as dynamic games of incomplete information and derive results on the uniqueness and revenue properties of the resulting equilibria. They also provide a nice description of the evolution of the market for sponsored search. Varian [18] also studies slot auctions under a setting of complete information. He focuses on symmetric equilibria, which are a refinement of Nash equilibria appropriate for slot auctions. He provides bounds on the revenue obtained in equilibrium. He also gives bounds that can be used to infer bidder values given their bids, and performs some empirical analysis using these results. In contrast, we focus instead on efficiency and provide bounds on the deviation from efficiency in complete-information equilibria. 2. PRELIMINARIES We focus on a slot auction for a single keyword. In a setting of incomplete information, a bidder knows only distributions over others private information (value per click and relevance). With complete information, a bidder knows others private information, and so does not need to rely on distributions to strategize. We first describe the model for the case with incomplete information, and drop the distributional information from the model when we come to the complete-information case in Section 4. 2.1 The Model There is a fixed number K of slots to be allocated among N bidders. We assume without loss of generality that K ≤ N, since superfluous slots can remain blank. Bidder i assigns a value of Xi to each click received on its advertisement, regardless of this advertisements rank.9 The probability that is advertisement will be clicked if viewed is Ai ∈ [0, 1]. We refer to Ai as bidder is relevance. We refer to Ri = AiXi as bidder is revenue. The Xi, Ai, and Ri are random 9 Indeed Kitts et al. [10] find that in their sample of actual click data, the correlation between rank and conversion rate is not statistically significant. However, for the purposes of our model it is also important that bidders believe that conversion rate does not vary with rank. variables and we denote their realizations by xi, αi, and ri respectively. The probability that an advertisement will be viewed if placed in slot j is γj ∈ [0, 1]. We assume γ1 > γ2 > . . . > γK. Hence bidder is advertisement will have a clickthrough rate of γjαi if placed in slot j. Of course, an advertisement does not receive any clicks if it is not allocated a slot. Each bidders value and relevance pair (Xi, Ai) is independently and identically distributed on [0, ¯x] × [0, 1] according to a continuous density function f that has full support on its domain. The density f and slot probabilities γ1, . . . , γK are common knowledge. Only bidder i knows the realization xi of its value per click Xi. Both bidder i and the seller know the realization αi of Ai, but this realization remains unobservable to the other bidders. We assume that bidders have quasi-linear utility functions. That is, the expected utility to bidder i of obtaining the slot of rank j at a price of b per click is ui(j, b) = γjαi(xi − b) If the advertising firms bidding in the slot auction are riskneutral and have ample liquidity, quasi-linearity is a reasonable assumption. The assumptions of independence, symmetry, and riskneutrality made above are all quite standard in single-item auction theory [11, 19]. The assumption that clickthrough rate decays monotonically with lower slots-by the same factors for each agent-is unique to the slot auction problem. We view it as a main contribution of our work to show that this assumption allows for tractable analysis of the slot auction problem using standard tools from singleitem auction theory. It also allows for interesting results in the complete information case. A common model of decaying clickthrough rate is the exponential decay model, where γk = 1 δk−1 with decay δ > 1. Feng et al. [7] state that their actual clickthrough data is fitted extremely well by an exponential decay model with δ = 1.428. Our model lacks budget constraints, which are an important feature of real slot auctions. With budget constraints keyword auctions cannot be considered independently of one another, because the budget must be allocated across multiple keywords-a single advertiser typically bids on multiple keywords relevant to his business. Introducing this element into the model is an important next step for future work.10 2.2 Auction Formats In a slot auction a bidder provides to the seller a declared value per click ˜xi(xi, αi) which depends on his true value and relevance. We often denote this declared value (bid) by ˜xi for short. Since a bidders relevance αi is observable to the seller, the bidder cannot misrepresent it. We denote the kth highest of the N declared values by ˜x(k) , and the kth highest of the N declared revenues by ˜r(k) , where the declared revenue of bidder i is ˜ri = αi ˜xi. We consider two types of allocation rules, rank by bid (RBB) and rank by revenue (RBR): 10 Models with budget constraints have begun to appear in this research area. Abrams [1] and Borgs et al. [3] design multi-unit auctions for budget-constrained bidders, which can be interpreted as slot auctions, with a focus on revenue optimization and truthfulness. Mehta et al. [14] address the problem of matching user queries to budget-constrained advertisers so as to maximize revenue. 220 RBB. Slot k goes to bidder i if and only if ˜xi = ˜x(k) . RBR. Slot k goes to bidder i if and only if ˜ri = ˜r(k) . We will commonly represent an allocation by a one-to-one function σ : [K] → [N], where [n] is the set of integers {1, 2, . . . , n}. Hence slot k goes to bidder σ(k). We also consider two different types of payment rules. Note that no matter what the payment rule, a bidder that is not allocated a slot will pay 0 since his listing cannot receive any clicks. First-price. The bidder allocated slot k, namely σ(k), pays ˜xσ(k) per click under both the RBB and RBR allocation rules. Second-price. If k < N, bidder σ(k) pays ˜xσ(k+1) per click under the RBB rule, and pays ˜rσ(k+1)/ασ(k) per click under the RBR rule. If k = N, bidder σ(k) pays 0 per click.11 Intuitively, a second-price payment rule sets a bidders payment to the lowest bid it could have declared while maintaining the same ranking, given the allocation rule used. Overture introduced the first slot auction design in 1997, using a first-price RBB scheme. Google then followed in 2000 with a second-price RBR scheme. In 2002, Overture (at this point acquired by Yahoo!) then switched to second pricing but still allocates using RBB. One possible reason for the switch is given in Section 4. We assume that ties are broken as follows in the event that two agents make the exact same bid or declare the same revenue. There is a permutation of the agents κ : [N] → [N] that is fixed beforehand. If the bids of agents i and j are tied, then agent i obtains a higher slot if and only if κ(i) < κ(j). This is consistent with the practice in real slot auctions where ties are broken by the bidders order of arrival. 3. INCOMPLETE INFORMATION 3.1 Incentives It should be clear that with a first-price payment rule, truthful bidding is neither a dominant strategy nor an ex post Nash equilibrium using either RBB or RBR, because this guarantees a payoff of 0. There is always an incentive to shade true values with first pricing. The second-price payment rule is reminiscent of the secondprice (Vickrey) auction used for selling a single item, and in a Vickrey auction it is a dominant strategy for a bidder to reveal his true value for the item [19]. However, using a second-price rule in a slot auction together with either allocation rule above does not yield an incentive-compatible mechanism, either in dominant strategies or ex post Nash equilibrium.12 With a second-price rule there is no incentive for a bidder to bid higher than his true value per click using either RBB or RBR: this either leads to no change 11 We are effectively assuming a reserve price of zero, but in practice search engines charge a non-zero reserve price per click. 12 Unless of course there is only a single slot available, since this is the single-item case. With a single slot both RBB and RBR with a second-price payment rule are dominantstrategy incentive-compatible. in the outcome, or a situation in which he will have to pay more than his value per click for each click received, resulting in a negative payoff.13 However, with either allocation rule there may be an incentive to shade true values with second pricing. Claim 1. With second pricing and K ≥ 2, truthful bidding is not a dominant strategy nor an ex post Nash equilibrium for either RBB or RBR. Example. There are two agents and two slots. The agents have relevance α1 = α2 = 1, whereas γ1 = 1 and γ2 = 1/2. Agent 1 has a value of x1 = 6 per click, and agent 2 has a value of x2 = 4 per click. Let us first consider the RBB rule. Suppose agent 2 bids truthfully. If agent 1 also bids truthfully, he wins the first slot and obtains a payoff of 2. However, if he shades his bid down below 4, he obtains the second slot at a cost of 0 per click yielding a payoff of 3. Since the agents have equal relevance, the exact same situation holds with the RBR rule. Hence truthful bidding is not a dominant strategy in either format, and neither is it an ex post Nash equilibrium. To find payments that make RBB and RBR dominantstrategy incentive-compatible, we can apply Holmstroms lemma [9] (see also chapter 3 in Milgrom [15]). Under the restriction that a bidder with value 0 per click does not pay anything (even if he obtains a slot, which can occur if there are as many slots as bidders), this lemma implies that there is a unique payment rule that achieves dominant-strategy incentive compatibility for either allocation rule. For RBB, the bidder allocated slot k is charged per click KX i=k+1 (γi−1 − γi)˜x(i) + γK ˜x(K+1) (1) Note that if K = N, ˜x(K+1) = 0 since there is no K + 1th bidder. For RBR, the bidder allocated slot k is charged per click 1 ασ(k) KX i=k+1 (γi−1 − γi)˜r(i) + γK ˜r(K+1) ! (2) Using payment rule (2) and RBR, the auctioneer is aware of the true revenues of the bidders (since they reveal their values truthfully), and hence ranks them according to their true revenues. We show in Section 3.3 that this allocation is in fact efficient. Since the VCG mechanism is the unique mechanism that is efficient, truthful, and ensures bidders with value 0 pay nothing (by the Green-Laffont theorem [8]), the RBR rule and payment scheme (2) constitute exactly the VCG mechanism. In the VCG mechanism an agent pays the externality he imposes on others. To understand payment (2) in this sense, note that the first term is the added utility (due to an increased clickthrough rate) agents in slots k + 1 to K would receive if they were all to move up a slot; the last term is the utility that the agent with the K +1st revenue would receive by obtaining the last slot as opposed to nothing. The leading coefficient simply reduces the agents expected payment to a payment per click. 13 In a dynamic setting with second pricing, there may be an incentive to bid higher than ones true value in order to exhaust competitors budgets. This phenomenon is commonly called bid jamming or antisocial bidding [4]. 221 3.2 Equilibrium Analysis To understand the efficiency and revenue properties of the various auction formats, we must first understand which rankings of the bidders occur in equilibrium with different allocation and payment rule combinations. The following lemma essentially follows from the Monotonic Selection Theorem by Milgrom and Shannon [16]. Lemma 1. In a RBB (RBR) auction with either a firstor second-price payment rule, the symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium bid is strictly increasing with value ( revenue). As a consequence of this lemma, we find that RBB and RBR auctions allocate the slots greedily by the true values and revenues of the agents, respectively (whether using firstor second-price payment rules). This will be relevant in Section 3.3 below. For a first-price payment rule, we can explicitly derive the symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium bid functions for RBB and RBR auctions. The purpose of this exercise is to lend qualitative insights into the parameters that influence an agents bidding, and to derive formulae for the expected revenue in RBB and RBR auctions in order to make a revenue ranking of these two allocation rules (in Section 3.4). Let G(y) be the expected resulting clickthrough rate, in a symmetric equilibrium of the RBB auction (with either payment rule), to a bidder with value y and relevance α = 1. Let H(y) be the analogous quantity for a bidder with revenue y and relevance 1 in a RBR auction. By Lemma 1, a bidder with value y will obtain slot k in a RBB auction if y is the kth highest of the true realized values. The same applies in a RBR auction when y is the kth highest of the true realized revenues. Let FX (y) be the distribution function for value, and let FR(y) be the distribution function for revenue. The probability that y is the kth highest out of N values is N − 1 k − 1 ! (1 − FX (y))k−1 FX (y)N−k whereas the probability that y is the kth highest out of N revenues is the same formula with FR replacing FX . Hence we have G(y) = KX k=1 γk N − 1 k − 1 ! (1 − FX (y))k−1 FX (y)N−k The H function is analogous to G with FR replacing FX . In the two propositions that follow, g and h are the derivatives of G and H respectively. We omit the proof of the next proposition, because it is almost identical to the derivation of the equilibrium bid in the single-item case (see Krishna [11], Proposition 2.2). Proposition 1. The symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium strategies in a first-price RBB auction are given by ˜xB (x, α) = 1 G(x) Z x 0 y g(y)dy The first-price equilibrium above closely parallels the firstprice equilibrium in the single-item model. With a single item g is the density of the second highest value among all N agent values, whereas in a slot auction it is a weighted combination of the densities for the second, third, etc. highest values. Note that the symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium bid in a first-price RBB auction does not depend on a bidders relevance α. To see clearly why, note that a bidder chooses a bid b so as to maximize the objective αG(˜x−1 (b))(x − b) and here α is just a leading constant factor. So dropping it does not change the set of optimal solutions. Hence the equilibrium bid depends only on the value x and function G, and G in turn depends only on the marginal cumulative distribution of value FX . So really only the latter needs to be common knowledge to the bidders. On the other hand, we will now see that information about relevance is needed for bidders to play the equilibrium in the first-price RBR auction. So the informational requirements for a first-price RBB auction are much weaker than for a first-price RBR auction: in the RBB auction a bidder need not know his own relevance, and need not know any distributional information over others relevance in order to play the equilibrium. Again we omit the next propositions proof since it is so similar to the one above. Proposition 2. The symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium strategies in a first-price RBR auction are given by ˜xR (x, α) = 1 αH(αx) Z αx 0 y h(y) dy Here it can be seen that the equilibrium bid is increasing with x, but not necessarily with α. This should not be much of a concern to the auctioneer, however, because in any case the declared revenue in equilibrium is always increasing in the true revenue. It would be interesting to obtain the equilibrium bids when using a second-price payment rule, but it appears that the resulting differential equations for this case do not have a neat analytical solution. Nonetheless, the same conclusions about the informational requirements of the RBB and RBR rules still hold, as can be seen simply by inspecting the objective function associated with an agents bidding problem for the second-price case. 3.3 Efficiency A slot auction is efficient if in equilibrium the sum of the bidders revenues from their allocated slots is maximized. Using symmetry as our equilibrium selection criterion, we find that the RBB auction is not efficient with either payment rule. Claim 2. The RBB auction is not efficient with either first or second pricing. Example. There are two agents and one slot, with γ1 = 1. Agent 1 has a value of x1 = 6 per click and relevance α1 = 1/2. Agent 2 has a value of x2 = 4 per click and relevance α2 = 1. By Lemma 1, agents are ranked greedily by value. Hence agent 1 obtains the lone slot, for a total revenue of 3 to the agents. However, it is most efficient to allocate the slot to agent 2, for a total revenue of 4. Examples with more agents or more slots are simple to construct along the same lines. On the other hand, under our assumptions on how clickthrough rate decreases with lower rank, the RBR auction is efficient with either payment rule. 222 Theorem 1. The RBR auction is efficient with either first- or second-price payments rules. Proof. Since by Lemma 1 the agents equilibrium bids are increasing functions of their revenues in the RBR auction, slots are allocated greedily according to true revenues. Let σ be a non-greedy allocation. Then there are slots s, t with s < t and rσ(s) < rσ(t). We can switch the agents in slots s and t to obtain a new allocation, and the difference between the total revenue in this new allocation and the original allocations total revenue is ` γtrσ(s) + γsrσ(t) ´ − ` γsrσ(s) + γtrσ(t) ´ = (γs − γt) ` rσ(t) − rσ(s) ´ Both parenthesized terms above are positive. Hence the switch has increased the total revenue to the bidders. If we continue to perform such switches, we will eventually reach a greedy allocation of greater revenue than the initial allocation. Since the initial allocation was arbitrary, it follows that a greedy allocation is always efficient, and hence the RBR auctions allocation is efficient. Note that the assumption that clickthrough rate decays montonically by the same factors γ1, . . . , γK for all agents is crucial to this result. A greedy allocation scheme does not necessarily find an efficient solution if the clickthrough rates are monotonically decreasing in an independent fashion for each agent. 3.4 Revenue To obtain possible revenue rankings for the different auction formats, we first note that when the allocation rule is fixed to RBB, then using either a first-price, second-price, or truthful payment rule leads to the same expected revenue in a symmetric, increasing Bayes-Nash equilibrium. Because a RBB auction ranks agents by their true values in equilibrium for any of these payment rules (by Lemma 1), it follows that expected revenue is the same for all these payment rules, following arguments that are virtually identical to those used to establish revenue equivalence in the singleitem case (see e.g. Proposition 3.1 in Krishna [11]). The same holds for RBR auctions; however, the revenue ranking of the RBB and RBR allocation rules is still unclear. Because of this revenue equivalence principle, we can choose whichever payment rule is most convenient for the purpose of making revenue comparisons. Using Propositions 1 and 2, it is a simple matter to derive formulae for the expected revenue under both allocation rules. The payment of an agent in a RBB auction is mB (x, α) = αG(x)˜xV (x, α) The expected revenue is then N · E ˆ mV (X, A) ˜ , where the expectation is taken with respect to the joint density of value and relevance. The expected revenue formula for RBR auctions is entirely analogous using ˜xR (x, α) and the H function. With these in hand we can obtain revenue rankings for specific numbers of bidders and slots, and specific distributions over values and relevance. Claim 3. For fixed K, N, and fixed γ1, . . . , γK, no revenue ranking of RBB and RBR is possible for an arbitrary density f. Example. Assume there are 2 bidders, 2 slots, and that γ1 = 1, γ2 = 1/2. Assume that value-relevance pairs are uniformly distributed over [0, 1]× [0, 1]. For such a distribution with a closed-form formula, it is most convenient to use the revenue formulae just derived. RBB dominates RBR in terms of revenue for these parameters. The formula for the expected revenue in a RBB auction yields 1/12, whereas for RBR auctions we have 7/108. Assume instead that with probability 1/2 an agents valuerelevance pair is (1, 1/2), and that with probability 1/2 it is (1/2, 1). In this scenario it is more convenient to appeal to formulae (1) and (2). In a truthful auction the second agent will always pay 0. According to (1), in a truthful RBB auction the first agent makes an expected payment of E ˆ (γ1 − γ2)Aσ(1)Xσ(2) ˜ = 1 2 E ˆ Aσ(1) ˜ E ˆ Xσ(2) ˜ where we have used the fact that value and relevance are independently distributed for different agents. The expected relevance of the agent with the highest value is E ˆ Aσ(1) ˜ = 5/8. The expected second highest value is also E ˆ Xσ(2) ˜ = 5/8. The expected revenue for a RBB auction here is then 25/128. According to (2), in a truthful RBR auction the first agent makes an expected payment of E ˆ (γ1 − γ2)Rσ(2) ˜ = 1 2 E ˆ Rσ(2) ˜ In expectation the second highest revenue is E ˆ Rσ(2) ˜ = 1/2, so the expected revenue for a RBR auction is 1/4. Hence in this case the RBR auction yields higher expected revenue.1415 This example suggests the following conjecture: when value and relevance are either uncorrelated or positively correlated, RBB dominates RBR in terms of revenue. When value and relevance are negatively correlated, RBR dominates. 4. COMPLETE INFORMATION In typical slot auctions such as those run by Yahoo! and Google, bidders can adjust their bids up or down at any time. As B¨orgers et al. [2] and Edelman et al. [6] have noted, this can be viewed as a continuous-time process in which bidders learn each others bids. If the process stabilizes the result can then be modeled as a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies of the static one-shot game of complete information, since each bidder will be playing a best-response to the others bids.16 This argument seems especially appropriate for Yahoo!s slot auction design where all bids are 14 To be entirely rigorous and consistent with our initial assumptions, we should have constructed a continuous probability density with full support over an appropriate domain. Taking the domain to be e.g. [0, 1] × [0, 1] and a continuous density with full support that is sufficiently concentrated around (1, 1/2) and (1/2, 1), with roughly equal mass around both, would yield the same conclusion. 15 Claim 3 should serve as a word of caution, because Feng et al. [7] find through their simulations that with a bivariate normal distribution over value-relevance pairs, and with 5 slots, 15 bidders, and δ = 2, RBR dominates RBB in terms of revenue for any level of correlation between value and relevance. However, they assume that bidding behavior in a second-price slot auction can be well approximated by truthful bidding. 16 We do not claim that bidders will actually learn each others private information (value and relevance), just that for a stable set of bids there is a corresponding equilibrium of the complete information game. 223 made public. Google keeps bids private, but experimentation can allow one to discover other bids, especially since second pricing automatically reveals to an agent the bid of the agent ranked directly below him. 4.1 Equilibrium Analysis In this section we ask whether a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists in a RBB or RBR slot auction, with either first or second pricing. Before dealing with the first-price case there is a technical issue involving ties. In our model we allow bids to be nonnegative real numbers for mathematical convenience, but this can become problematic because there is then no bid that is just higher than another. We brush over such issues by assuming that an agent can bid infinitesimally higher than another. This is imprecise but allows us to focus on the intuition behind the result that follows. See Reny [17] for a full treatment of such issues. For the remainder of the paper, we assume that there are as many slots as bidders. The following result shows that there can be no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with first pricing.17 Note that the argument holds for both RBB and RBR allocation rules. For RBB, bids should be interpreted as declared values, and for RBR as declared revenues. Theorem 2. There exists no complete information Nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the first-price slot auction, for any possible values of the agents, whether using a RBB or RBR allocation rule. Proof. Let σ : [K] → [N] be the allocation of slots to the agents resulting from their bids. Let ri and bi be the revenue and bid of the agent ranked ith , respectively. Note that we cannot have bi > bi+1, or else the agent in slot i can make a profitable deviation by instead bidding bi − > bi+1 for small enough > 0. This does not change its allocation, but increases its profit. Hence we must have bi = bi+1 (i.e. with one bidder bidding infinitesimally higher than the other). Since this holds for any two consecutive bidders, it follows that in a Nash equilibrium all bidders must be bidding 0 (since the bidder ranked last matches the bid directly below him, which is 0 by default because there is no such bid). But this is impossible: consider the bidder ranked last. The identity of this bidder is always clear given the deterministic tie-breaking rule. This bidder can obtain the top spot and increase his revenue by (γ1 −γK)rK > 0 by bidding some > 0, and for small enough this is necessarily a profitable deviation. Hence there is no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. On the other hand, we find that in a second-price slot auction there can be a multitude of pure strategy Nash equilibria. The next two lemmas give conditions that characterize the allocations that can occur as a result of an equilibrium profile of bids, given fixed agent values and revenues. Then if we can exhibit an allocation that satisfies these conditions, there must exist at least one equilibrium. We first consider the RBR case. 17 B¨orgers et al. [2] have proven this result in a model with three bidders and three slots, and we generalize their argument. Edelman et al. [6] also point out this non-existence phenomenon. They only illustrate the fact with an example because the result is quite immediate. Lemma 2. Given an allocation σ, there exists a Nash equilibrium profile of bids b leading to σ in a second-price RBR slot auction if and only if „ 1 − γi γj+1 « rσ(i) ≤ rσ(j) for 1 ≤ j ≤ N − 2 and i ≥ j + 2. Proof. There exists a desired vector b which constitutes a Nash equilibrium if and only if the following set of inequalities can be satisfied (the variables are the πi and bj): πi ≥ γj(rσ(i) − bj) ∀i, ∀j < i (3) πi ≥ γj(rσ(i) − bj+1) ∀i, ∀j > i (4) πi = γi(rσ(i) − bi+1) ∀i (5) bi ≥ bi+1 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1 (6) πi ≥ 0, bi ≥ 0 ∀i Here rσ(i) is the revenue of the agent allocated slot i, and πi and bi may be interpreted as this agents surplus and declared revenue, respectively. We first argue that constraints (6) can be removed, because the inequalities above can be satisfied if and only if the inequalities without (6) can be satisfied. The necessary direction is immediate. Assume we have a vector (π, b) which satisfies all inequalities above except (6). Then there is some i for which bi < bi+1. Construct a new vector (π, b ) identical to the original except with bi+1 = bi. We now have bi = bi+1. An agent in slot k < i sees the price of slot i decrease from bi+1 to bi+1 = bi, but this does not make i more preferred than k to this agent because we have πk ≥ γi−1(rσ(k) − bi) ≥ γi(rσ(k) − bi) = γi(rσ(k) −bi+1) (i.e. because the agent in slot k did not originally prefer slot i − 1 at price bi, he will not prefer slot i at price bi). A similar argument applies for agents in slots k > i + 1. The agent in slot i sees the price of this slot go down, which only makes it more preferred. Finally, the agent in slot i + 1 sees no change in the price of any slot, so his slot remains most preferred. Hence inequalities (3)-(5) remain valid at (π, b ). We first make this change to the bi+1 where bi < bi+1 and index i is smallest. We then recursively apply the change until we eventually obtain a vector that satisfies all inequalities. We safely ignore inequalities (6) from now on. By the Farkas lemma, the remaining inequalities can be satisfied if and only if there is no vector z such that X i,j (γj rσ(i)) zσ(i)j > 0 X i>j γjzσ(i)j + X i<j γj−1zσ(i)j−1 ≤ 0 ∀j (7) X j zσ(i)j ≤ 0 ∀i (8) zσ(i)j ≥ 0 ∀i, ∀j = i zσ(i)i free ∀i Note that a variable of the form zσ(i)i appears at most once in a constraint of type (8), so such a variable can never be positive. Also, zσ(i)1 = 0 for all i = 1 by constraint (7), since such variables never appear with another of the form zσ(i)i. Now if we wish to raise zσ(i)j above 0 by one unit for j = i, we must lower zσ(i)i by one unit because of the constraint of type (8). Because γjrσ(i) ≤ γirσ(i) for i < j, raising 224 zσ(i)j with i < j while adjusting other variables to maintain feasibility cannot make the objective P i,j(γjrσ(i))zσ(i)j positive. If this objective is positive, then this is due to some component zσ(i)j with i > j being positive. Now for the constraints of type (7), if i > j then zσ(i)j appears with zσ(j−1)j−1 (for 1 < j < N). So to raise the former variable γ−1 j units and maintain feasibility, we must (I) lower zσ(i)i by γ−1 j units, and (II) lower zσ(j−1)j−1 by γ−1 j−1 units. Hence if the following inequalities hold: rσ(i) ≤ „ γi γj « rσ(i) + rσ(j−1) (9) for 2 ≤ j ≤ N − 1 and i > j, raising some zσ(i)j with i > j cannot make the objective positive, and there is no z that satisfies all inequalities above. Conversely, if some inequality (9) does not hold, the objective can be made positive by raising the corresponding zσ(i)j and adjusting other variables so that feasibility is just maintained. By a slight reindexing, inequalities (9) yield the statement of the theorem. The RBB case is entirely analogous. Lemma 3. Given an allocation σ, there exists a Nash equilibrium profile of bids b leading to σ in a second-price RBB slot auction if and only if „ 1 − γi γj+1 « xσ(i) ≤ xσ(j) for 1 ≤ j ≤ N − 2 and i ≥ j + 2. Proof Sketch. The proof technique is the same as in the previous lemma. The desired Nash equilibrium exists if and only if a related set of inequalities can be satisfied; by the Farkas lemma, this occurs if and only if an alternate set of inequalities cannot be satisfied. The conditions that determine whether the latter holds are given in the statement of the lemma. The two lemmas above immediately lead to the following result. Theorem 3. There always exists a complete information Nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the second-price RBB slot auction. There always exists an efficient complete information Nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the secondprice RBR slot auction. Proof. First consider RBB. Suppose agents are ranked according to their true values. Since xσ(i) ≤ xσ(j) for i > j, the system of inequalities in Lemma 3 is satisfied, and the allocation is the result of some Nash equilibrium bid profile. By the same type of argument but appealing to Lemma 2 for RBR, there exists a Nash equilibrium bid profile such that bidders are ranked according to their true revenues. By Theorem 1, this latter allocation is efficient. This theorem establishes existence but not uniqueness. Indeed we expect that in many cases there will be multiple allocations (and hence equilibria) which satisfy the conditions of Lemmas 2 and 3. In particular, not all equilibria of a second-price RBR auction will be efficient. For instance, according to Lemma 2, with two agents and two slots any allocation can arise in a RBR equilibrium because no constraints apply. Theorems 2 and 3 taken together provide a possible explanation for Yahoo!s switch from first to second pricing. We saw in Section 3.1 that this does not induce truthfulness from bidders. With first pricing, there will always be some bidder that feels compelled to adjust his bid. Second pricing is more convenient because an equilibrium can be reached, and this reduces the cost of bid management. 4.2 Efficiency For a given allocation rule, we call the allocation that would result if the bidders reported their values truthfully the standard allocation. Hence in the standard RBB allocation bidders are ranked by true values, and in the standard RBR allocation they are ranked by true revenues. According to Lemmas 2 and 3, a ranking that results from a Nash equilibrium profile can only deviate from the standard allocation by having agents with relatively similar values or revenues switch places. That is, if ri > rj then with RBR agent j can be ranked higher than i only if the ratio rj/ri is sufficiently large; similarly for RBB. This suggests that the value of an equilibrium allocation cannot differ too much from the value obtained in the standard allocation, and the following theorems confirms this. For an allocation σ of slots to agents, we denote its total value by f(σ) = PN i=1 γirσ(i). We denote by g(σ) = PN i=1 γixσ(i) allocation σs value when assuming all agents have identical relevance, normalized to 1. Let L = min i=1,...,N−1 min  γi+1 γi , 1 − γi+2 γi+1 ff (where by default γN+1 = 0). Let ηx and ηr be the standard allocations when using RBB and RBR, respectively. Theorem 4. For an allocation σ that results from a purestrategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBR slot auction, we have f(σ) ≥ Lf(ηr). Proof. We number the agents so that agent i has the ith highest revenue, so r1 ≥ r2 ≥ . . . ≥ rN . Hence the standard allocation has value f(ηr) = PN i=1 γiri. To prove the theorem, we will make repeated use of the fact thatP k akP k bk ≥ mink ak bk when the ak and bk are positive. Note that according to Lemma 2, if agent i lies at least two slots below slot j, then rσ(j) ≥ ri 1 − γj+2 γj+1 . It may be the case that for some slot i, we have σ(i) > i and for slots k > i + 1 we have σ(k) > i. We then say that slot i is inverted. Let S be the set of agents with indices at least i + 1; there are N − i of these. If slot i is inverted, it is occupied by some agent from S. Also all slots strictly lower than i + 1 must be occupied by the remaining agents from S, since σ(k) > i for k ≥ i + 2. The agent in slot i + 1 must then have an index σ(i + 1) ≤ i (note this means slot i + 1 cannot be inverted). Now there are two cases. In the first case we have σ(i) = i + 1. Then γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ γi+1ri + γiri+1 γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ min  γi+1 γi , γi γi+1 ff = γi+1 γi In the second case we have σ(i) > i+1. Then since all agents in S except the one in slot i lie strictly below slot i + 1, and 225 the agent in slot i is not agent i + 1, it must be that agent i+1 is in a slot strictly below slot i+1. This means that it is at least two slots below the agent that actually occupies slot i, and by Lemma 2 we then have rσ(i) ≥ ri+1 1 − γi+2 γi+1 . Thus, γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ γi+1ri + γirσ(i) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ min  γi+1 γi , 1 − γi+2 γi+1 ff If slot i is not inverted, then on one hand we may have σ(i) ≤ i, in which case rσ(i)/ri ≥ 1. On the other hand we may have σ(i) > i but there is some agent with index j ≤ i that lies at least two slots below slot i. Then by Lemma 2, rσ(i) ≥ rj 1 − γi+2 γi+1 ≥ ri 1 − γi+2 γi+1 . We write i ∈ I if slot i is inverted, and i ∈ I if neither i nor i − 1 are inverted. By our arguments above two consecutive slots cannot be inverted, so we can write f(σ) f(γr) = P i∈I ` γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) ´ + P i∈I γirσ(i) P i∈I (γiri + γi+1ri+1) + P i∈I γiri ≥ min  min i∈I  γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ff , min i∈I  γirσ(i) γiri ffff ≥ L and this completes the proof. Note that for RBR, the standard value is also the efficient value by Theorem 1. Also note that for an exponential decay model, L = min ˘1 δ , 1 − 1 δ ¯ . With δ = 1.428 (see Section 2.1), the factor is L ≈ 1/3.34, so the total value in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBR slot auction is always within a factor of 3.34 of the efficient value with such a discount. Again for RBB we have an analogous result. Theorem 5. For an allocation σ that results from a purestrategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBB slot auction, we have g(σ) ≥ Lg(ηx). Proof Sketch. Simply substitute bidder values for bidder revenues in the proof of Theorem 4, and appeal to Lemma 3. 5. CONCLUSIONS This paper analyzed stylized versions of the slot auction designs currently used by Yahoo! and Google, namely rank by bid (RBB) and rank by revenue (RBR), respectively. We also considered first and second pricing rules together with each of these allocation rules, since both have been used historically. We first studied the short-run setting with incomplete information, corresponding to the case where agents have just approached the mechanism. Our equilibrium analysis revealed that RBB has much weaker informational requirements than RBR, because bidders need not know any information about relevance (even their own) to play the Bayes-Nash equilibrium. However, RBR leads to an efficient allocation in equilibrium, whereas RBB does not. We showed that for an arbitrary distribution over value and relevance, no revenue ranking of RBB and RBR is possible. We hope that the tools we used to establish these results (revenue equivalence, the form of first-price equilibria, the truthful payments rules) will help others wanting to pursue further analyses of slot auctions. We also studied the long-run case where agents have experimented with their bids and each settled on one they find optimal. We argued that a stable set of bids in this setting can be modeled as a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of the static game of complete information. We showed that no pure-strategy equilibrium exists with either RBB or RBR using first pricing, but that with second pricing there always exists such an equilibrium (in the case of RBR, an efficient equilibrium). In general second pricing allows for multiple pure-strategy equilibria, but we showed that the value of such equilibria diverges by only a constant factor from the value obtained if all agents bid truthfully (which in the case of RBR is the efficient value). 6. FUTURE WORK Introducing budget constraints into the model is a natural next step for future work. The complication here lies in the fact that budgets are often set for entire campaigns rather than single keywords. Assuming that the optimal choice of budget can be made independent of the choice of bid for a specific keyword, it can be shown that it is a dominant-strategy to report this optimal budget with ones bid. The problem is then to ascertain that bids and budgets can indeed be optimized separately, or to find a plausible model where deriving equilibrium bids and budgets together is tractable. Identifying a condition on the distribution over value and relevance that actually does yield a revenue ranking of RBB and RBR (such as correlation between value and relevance, perhaps) would yield a more satisfactory characterization of their relative revenue properties. Placing bounds on the revenue obtained in a complete information equilibrium is also a relevant question. Because the incomplete information case is such a close generalization of the most basic single-item auction model, it would be interesting to see which standard results from single-item auction theory (e.g. results with risk-averse bidders, an endogenous number of bidders, asymmetries, etc...) automatically generalize and which do not, to fully understand the structural differences between single-item and slot auctions.

Introducción hoy, los gigantes de Internet Google y Yahoo!Cuenta con una capitalización de mercado combinada de más de $ 150 mil millones, en gran parte sobre la fortaleza de la búsqueda patrocinada, el componente de más rápido crecimiento de una industria de publicidad en línea resurgente. PricewaterhouseCoopers estima que los ingresos de búsqueda patrocinados en toda la industria de 2004 fueron de $ 3.9 mil millones, o el 40% del total de ingresos por publicidad de Internet.1 Los observadores de la industria esperan que los ingresos de 2005 alcancen o superen los $ 7 mil millones.2 aproximadamente el 80% de los Googles estimaron $ 4 mil millones en 2005 y aproximadamente en 2005 y aproximadamente aproximadamente.El 45% de los ingresos estimados por $ 3.7 mil millones en 2005 probablemente serán atribuibles a la búsqueda patrocinada.3 Varias de otras compañías, incluidas las miradas, FindwAn, InterActIVECorp (Ask Jeeves) y eBay (Shoping.com) -Ancientos de millones de millones de millones de millones de personas.de dólares de ingresos de búsqueda patrocinados anualmente. La búsqueda patrocinada es una forma de publicidad donde los comerciantes pagan para aparecer junto con los resultados de búsqueda web. Por ejemplo, cuando un usuario busca Honda Accord San Diego usado en un motor de búsqueda web, una variedad de entidades comerciales (los concesionarios de automóviles de San Diego, Honda Corp, portales de información de automóviles, agregadores de anuncios clasificados, eBay, etc.) pueden ofertarPara tener sus listados aparecidos junto con los listados de búsqueda algorítmica estándar. Los anunciantes ofertan para la ubicación en la página en un formato de estilo de subasta donde más alto ofertan, más probable es que aparezca su listado por encima de otros anuncios en la página. Por convención, los anunciantes de búsqueda patrocinados generalmente pagan por clic, lo que significa que solo pagan cuando un usuario hace clic en su anuncio y no pagan si su anuncio se muestra pero no se hace clic. Aunque muchas personas afirman ignorar sistemáticamente los anuncios de búsqueda patrocinados, Majestic Research informa que 1 www.iab.net/resources/adrevenue/pdf/iab pwc 2004full.pdf 2 battellemedia.com/archives/002032.php 3 Estas son ásperas de las ásperas de lasEstimaciones de sobre. Google y Yahoo!Las estimaciones de ingresos de 2005 se obtuvieron de Yahoo! Finanzas. Asumimos $ 7 mil millones en los ingresos de búsqueda patrocinados por toda la industria de 2005. Utilizamos las estimaciones de Nielsen/Netratings de la cuota de mercado de los motores de búsqueda en los EE.

Los resultados de búsqueda patrocinados se muestran en un formato similar a los resultados algorítmicos: como una lista de elementos, cada uno que contiene un título, una descripción de texto y un hipervínculo a una página web correspondiente. Llamamos a cada posición en la lista una ranura. En general, los anuncios que aparecen en una ranura de mayor clasificación (más alta en la página) atraen más atención y más clics de los usuarios. Por lo tanto, todo lo demás es igual, los comerciantes generalmente prefieren ranuras de mayor rango a espacios de rango más bajo. Los comerciantes ofertan por la colocación junto a consultas de búsqueda particulares;Por ejemplo, Orbitz y Travelocity pueden ofertar para el Hotel Las Vegas, mientras que Dell y HP ofrecen una computadora portátil. Como se mencionó, las ofertas se expresan como una disposición máxima para pagar por clic. Por ejemplo, una oferta de cuarenta centavos por Hostrocket para alojamiento web significa que Hostrocket está dispuesto a pagar hasta cuarenta centavos cada vez que un usuario hace clic en su anuncio.5 El subastador (el motor de búsqueda6) evalúa las ofertas y asigna ranuras a los anunciantes. En principio, la decisión de asignación se puede alterar con cada nueva consulta de búsqueda entrante, por lo que, en efecto, nuevas subastas se despejan continuamente con el tiempo a medida que llegan consultas de búsqueda. Muchas reglas de asignación son plausibles. En este documento, investigamos dos reglas de asignación, que corresponden aproximadamente a las dos reglas de asignación utilizadas por Yahoo!y Google. La asignación de rango por BID (RBB) asigna espacios en orden de ofertas, con espacios de mayor rango que van a los postores superiores. La asignación de rango por ingresos (RBR) asigna espacios en orden del producto de los tiempos de oferta esperados, donde la relevancia es la proporción de usuarios que hacen clic en el anuncio de comerciantes después de verlo. En nuestro modelo, suponemos que el subastador y el anunciante se conocen una relevancia de ADS esperada (pero no necesariamente para otros anunciantes), y que la tasa de clics decae monotónicamente con ranuras de menor rango. En la práctica, la tasa de clics esperada depende de una serie de factores, incluida la posición en la página, el texto del anuncio (que a su vez depende de la identidad del postor), la naturaleza y la intención del usuario, y el contexto de otrosLos anuncios y los resultados algorítmicos en la página, y el subastador debe aprender con el tiempo tanto por el subastador como por el postor [13]. Al momento de escribir esto, a una aproximación aproximada de primer orden, Yahoo!emplea una asignación de RBB y Google emplea una asignación RBR, aunque numerosas advertencias se aplican en ambos casos cuando se trata de los caprichos de las implementaciones del mundo real.7 Incluso cuando se examina una versión de una sola vez de una subasta de ranura, el mecanismo difiere de un estándarMulti-item AUC4 Battellemedia.com/archives/001102.php 5 Por lo general, los anunciantes también establecen límites de presupuesto diarios o mensuales;En este artículo no modelamos restricciones presupuestarias.6 En la industria de búsqueda patrocinada, el subastador y el motor de búsqueda no siempre son la misma entidad. Por ejemplo, Google ejecuta los anuncios de búsqueda patrocinados para la búsqueda web de AOL, con los ingresos compartidos. Del mismo modo, Yahoo!Actualmente ejecuta los anuncios de búsqueda patrocinados para la búsqueda web de MSN, aunque Microsoft comenzará las operaciones independientes pronto.7 Aquí hay dos entre muchas excepciones al Yahoo!= RBB y Google = Afirmación RBR: (1) Yahoo!excluye los anuncios que se consideran insuficientemente relevantes por un editor humano o por una mala tasa de clics históricos;(2) Google establece diferentes precios de reserva dependiendo de la estimación de Googles de la calidad de los anuncios.ción de manera sutil. Primero, se utiliza una sola oferta por comerciante para asignar múltiples espacios no idénticos. En segundo lugar, la oferta se comunica no como una preferencia directa sobre las ranuras, sino como una preferencia por los clics que dependen estocásticamente de la asignación de ranuras. Investigamos una serie de propiedades económicas de las subastas de ranuras RBB y RBR. Consideramos el caso de información incompleta a corto plazo en la Sección 3, adaptando y extendiendo análisis estándar de subastas de elementos únicos. En la Sección 4 pasamos al caso de información completa a largo plazo;Nuestros resultados de caracterización aquí se basan en técnicas de programación lineal. En todo momento, las observaciones importantes se destacan como reclamos respaldados por ejemplos. Nuestras contribuciones son las siguientes: • Mostramos que con múltiples espacios, los postores no revelan sus valores verdaderos con RBB o RBR, y con el primer o segundo precio.• Con información incompleta, encontramos que los requisitos informativos para jugar la oferta de equilibrio son mucho más débiles para RBB que para RBR, porque los postores no necesitan saber ninguna información sobre la relevancia de los demás (o incluso la suya) con RBB.• Con información incompleta, demostramos que RBR es eficiente pero que RBB no lo es.• Mostramos a través de un ejemplo simple de que no es posible una clasificación de ingresos generales de RBB y RBR.• Probamos que en un entorno de información completa, las subastas de ranuras de primer precio no tienen una estrategia pura equilibrio Nash, pero que siempre existe un equilibrio de estrategia pura con el segundo precio.• Proporcionamos un límite de factor constante en la desviación de la eficiencia que puede ocurrir en el equilibrio de una subasta de ranura de segundo precio. En la Sección 2 especificamos nuestro modelo de postores y los diversos formatos de subasta de ranuras. En la Sección 3.1 estudiamos las propiedades de incentivos de cada formato, preguntando en qué casos los agentes ofertarían con sinceridad. Aquí hay posible confusión porque el diseño de segundo precio para las subastas de ranuras recuerda a la subasta de Vickrey para un solo artículo;Observamos que para las subastas de ranuras, el mecanismo de Vickrey es, de hecho, muy diferente del mecanismo de segundo precio, por lo que tienen diferentes propiedades de incentivos.8 En la Sección 3.2 derivamos las ofertas de equilibrio de Bayes-Nash para los diversos formatos de subasta. Esto es útil para la eficiencia y los resultados de los ingresos en secciones posteriores. Debería quedar claro en esta sección que las subastas de ranuras en nuestro modelo son una generalización directa de las subastas de un solo elemento. Las secciones 3.3 y 3.4 abordan cuestiones de eficiencia e ingresos bajo información incompleta, respectivamente. En la Sección 4.1 determinamos si existen equilibrios de estrategia pura para los diversos formatos de subasta, bajo información completa. En la Sección 4.2 derivamos límites en la desviación de la eficiencia en los equilibrios de estrategia pura de las subastas de ranuras de segundo precio. Nuestro enfoque es positivo más que normativo. Nuestro objetivo es aclarar el incentivo, la eficiencia y las propiedades de ingresos de dos diseños de subastas de ranura actualmente en uso, bajo los entornos de otros 8 autores también han hecho esta observación [5, 6].219 Información incompleta y completa. No intentamos derivar el mecanismo óptimo para una subasta de ranura. Trabajo relacionado. Feng et al.[7] Compare el rendimiento de los ingresos de varios mecanismos de clasificación para las subastas de ranuras en un modelo con información incompleta, al igual que nosotros en la Sección 3.4, pero obtienen sus resultados a través de simulaciones, mientras que realizamos un análisis de equilibrio. Liu y Chen [12] Propiedades del estudio de las subastas de ranuras bajo información incompleta. Su entorno es esencialmente el mismo que el nuestro, excepto que restringen su atención a un modelo con una sola ranura y un tipo binario para la relevancia del postor (alta o baja). Encuentran que RBR es eficiente, pero que no es posible una clasificación de ingresos generales de RBB y RBR, lo que está de acuerdo con nuestros resultados. También adoptan un enfoque de diseño y muestran cómo el subastador debe asignar puntajes de relevancia para optimizar sus ingresos. Edelman et al.[6] Modele el problema de la subasta de ranura como un juego estático de información completa y un juego dinámico de información incompleta. Estudian los equilibrios locales de EnvyFree del juego estático de información completa;Este es un concepto de solución motivado por ciertos comportamientos de licitación que surgen debido a la presencia de limitaciones presupuestarias. No ven las subastas de ranuras como juegos estáticos de información incompleta como nosotros, pero los estudian como juegos dinámicos de información incompleta y obtienen resultados sobre la singularidad y las propiedades de ingresos de los equilibrios resultantes. También proporcionan una buena descripción de la evolución del mercado para la búsqueda patrocinada. Varian [18] también estudia subastas de ranura bajo una configuración de información completa. Se enfoca en los equilibrios simétricos, que son un refinamiento de los equilibrios NASH apropiados para las subastas de ranuras. Proporciona límites a los ingresos obtenidos en equilibrio. También da límites que pueden usarse para inferir valores de los postres dadas sus ofertas, y realiza algún análisis empírico utilizando estos resultados. Por el contrario, nos centramos en la eficiencia y proporcionamos límites en la desviación de la eficiencia en los equilibrios de información completa.2. Preliminares Nos centramos en una subasta de ranura para una sola palabra clave. En una configuración de información incompleta, un postor solo conoce distribuciones sobre otras información privada (valor por clic y relevancia). Con información completa, un postor conoce a otros información privada y, por lo tanto, no necesita confiar en las distribuciones para elaborar estrategias. Primero describimos el modelo para el caso con información incompleta y eliminamos la información de distribución del modelo cuando llegamos al caso de información completa en la Sección 4. 2.1 El modelo hay un número fijo K de espacios para ser asignados entre los N postores. Suponemos sin pérdida de generalidad que K ≤ n, ya que las ranuras superfluas pueden permanecer en blanco. Poster I asigna un valor de Xi a cada clic recibido en su anuncio, independientemente de este rango de anuncios.9 La probabilidad que se anuncie se haga clic si se ve es ai ∈ [0, 1]. Nos referimos a la IA ya que el postor es relevancia. Nos referimos a RI = AIXI como Bidder es ingresos. Los XI, AI y RI son aleatorios 9 de hecho Kitts et al.[10] encuentran que en su muestra de datos de clic reales, la correlación entre el rango y la tasa de conversión no es estadísticamente significativa. Sin embargo, a los efectos de nuestro modelo, también es importante que los licitadores crean que la tasa de conversión no varía con el rango.variables y denotamos sus realizaciones por Xi, αi y Ri respectivamente. La probabilidad de que se vea un anuncio si se coloca en la ranura J es γj ∈ [0, 1]. Asumimos γ1> γ2>...> γk. Por lo tanto, el postor es anuncio tendrá una tasa de clics de γjαi si se coloca en la ranura j. Por supuesto, un anuncio no recibe ningún clic si no se le asigna una ranura. El par de valor y relevancia de cada licitador (xi, ai) se distribuye de forma independiente e idéntica en [0, ¯x] × [0, 1] de acuerdo con una función de densidad continua F que tiene soporte total en su dominio. La densidad F y las probabilidades de ranura γ1 ,..., γk son de conocimiento común. Solo el postor conoce la realización XI de su valor por clic xi. Tanto el postor i como el vendedor conocen la realización αi de la IA, pero esta realización sigue siendo inobsable para los otros postores. Suponemos que los postores tienen funciones cuasi lineales de utilidad. Es decir, la utilidad esperada para que el postor i obtenga la ranura de rango J a un precio de B por clic es ui (j, b) = γjαi (xi - b) si las empresas de publicidad que ofertan en la subasta de ranura son RiskNeutral y tienenAmplia liquidez, la cuasi-linealidad es una suposición razonable. Los suposiciones de independencia, simetría y riesgo que se realizan anteriormente son bastante estándar en la teoría de la subasta de un solo ítem [11, 19]. La suposición de que la tasa de clics decae monotónicamente con ranuras más bajas, por los mismos factores para cada agente, es exclusivo del problema de la subasta de ranuras. Lo vemos como una contribución principal de nuestro trabajo para mostrar que esta suposición permite el análisis manejable del problema de la subasta de ranura utilizando herramientas estándar de la teoría de la subasta de SingeItem. También permite resultados interesantes en el caso de información completa. Un modelo común de tasa de clics en descomposición es el modelo de desintegración exponencial, donde γk = 1 ΔK - 1 con desintegración Δ> 1. Feng et al.[7] indique que sus datos de clic reales están ajustados extremadamente bien mediante un modelo de descomposición exponencial con δ = 1.428. Nuestro modelo carece de limitaciones presupuestarias, que son una característica importante de las subastas de tragamonedas reales. Con restricciones presupuestarias, las subastas de palabras clave no pueden considerarse independientemente entre sí, porque el presupuesto debe asignarse a través de múltiples palabras clave, un anunciante único que generalmente ofrece múltiples palabras clave relevantes para su negocio. Introducir este elemento en el modelo es un siguiente paso importante para el trabajo futuro. 10 2.2 Formatos de subasta en una subasta de ranura que un postor proporciona al vendedor un valor declarado por clic ˜xi (xi, αi) que depende de su verdadero valor y relevancia. A menudo denotamos este valor declarado (oferta) por ˜xi para abreviar. Dado que la relevancia de los postores αi es observable para el vendedor, el postor no puede tergiversarlo. Denotamos el más alto de los valores declarados de N por ˜x (k), y el más alto de los n. Consideramos dos tipos de reglas de asignación, rango por oferta (RBB) y rango por ingresos (RBR): 10 modelos con restricciones presupuestarias han comenzado a aparecer en esta área de investigación. Abrams [1] y Borgs et al.[3] Diseñe subastas de unidades múltiples para licitadores con presupuesto limitados, que pueden interpretarse como subastas de tragamonedas, con un enfoque en la optimización de ingresos y la veracidad. Mehta et al.[14] Aborde el problema de hacer coincidir las consultas de los usuarios con los anunciantes con presupuesto con presupuesto para maximizar los ingresos.220 RBB. Slot K va al postor i si y solo si ˜xi = ˜x (k). RBR. Slot K va al postor i si y solo si ˜ri = ˜r (k). Representaremos comúnmente una asignación mediante una función uno a uno σ: [k] → [n], donde [n] es el conjunto de enteros {1, 2 ,..., n}. Por lo tanto, la ranura K va al postor σ (k). También consideramos dos tipos diferentes de reglas de pago. Tenga en cuenta que no importa cuál sea la regla de pago, un postor que no esté asignado, un espacio pagará 0, ya que su listado no puede recibir ningún clic. Primer precio. La ranura asignada al postor k, a saber, σ (k), paga ˜xσ (k) por clic en las reglas de asignación RBB y RBR. Segundo precio. Si k <n, el postor σ (k) paga ˜xσ (k+1) por clic debajo de la regla RBB, y paga ˜rσ (k+1)/ασ (k) por clic debajo de la regla RBR. Si K = N, el licitador σ (k) paga 0 por clic.11 Intuitivamente, una regla de pago de segundo precio establece el pago de los licitadores a la oferta más baja que podría haber declarado mientras mantiene la misma clasificación, dada la regla de asignación utilizada. La Obertura introdujo el primer diseño de subasta de ranura en 1997, utilizando un esquema RBB de primer precio. Google luego siguió en 2000 con un esquema RBR de segundo precio. En 2002, la obertura (en este punto adquirida por Yahoo!) luego cambió al segundo precio, pero aún asigna el uso de RBB. Una posible razón para el interruptor se da en la Sección 4. Suponemos que los lazos se rompen de la siguiente manera en caso de que dos agentes hagan exactamente la misma oferta o declaran los mismos ingresos. Hay una permutación de los agentes κ: [n] → [n] que se fija de antemano. Si las ofertas de los agentes I y J están atados, entonces el agente I obtiene una ranura más alta si y solo si κ (i) <κ (j). Esto es consistente con la práctica en subastas de ranuras reales donde la orden de llegada de los postores rompe los lazos de los postores.3. Información incompleta 3.1 Incentivos Debe estar claro que con una regla de pago de primer precio, la licitación sincera no es una estrategia dominante ni un equilibrio ex post Nash utilizando RBB o RBR, porque esto garantiza una recompensa de 0. Siempre hay un incentivo para sombrear valores verdaderos con los primeros precios. La regla de pago de segundo precio es una reminiscencia de la subasta de Segunda Price (Vickrey) utilizada para vender un solo artículo, y en una subasta de Vickrey es una estrategia dominante para un postor revele su verdadero valor para el artículo [19]. Sin embargo, el uso de una regla de segundo precio en una subasta de ranura junto con la regla de asignación anterior no produce un mecanismo compatible con incentivos, ya sea en estrategias dominantes o equilibrio ex post nash.12 Con una regla de segundo precio, no hay incentivo para unPuestador para ofertar más alto que su valor verdadero por clic usando RBB o RBR: esto no lleva a un cambio 11, asumimos efectivamente un precio de reserva de cero, pero en la práctica los motores de búsqueda cobran un precio de reserva distinto de cero por clic.12 A menos que, por supuesto, solo haya una ranura disponible, ya que este es el caso de un solo elemento. Con una sola ranura, tanto RBB como RBR con una regla de pago de segundo precio son compatibles con incentivos dominantes.en el resultado, o en una situación en la que tendrá que pagar más de su valor por clic por cada clic recibido recibido, lo que resulta en una recompensa negativa.13 Sin embargo, con cualquiera de la regla de asignación puede haber un incentivo para sombrear valores verdaderos con el segundo precio. Reclamación 1. Con el segundo precio y K ≥ 2, la licitación sincera no es una estrategia dominante ni un equilibrio ex post Nash para RBB o RBR. Ejemplo. Hay dos agentes y dos ranuras. Los agentes tienen relevancia α1 = α2 = 1, mientras que γ1 = 1 y γ2 = 1/2. El agente 1 tiene un valor de x1 = 6 por clic, y el agente 2 tiene un valor de x2 = 4 por clic. Primero consideremos la regla RBB. Supongamos que el agente 2 oferta sinceramente. Si el agente 1 también ofrece sinceramente, gana la primera ranura y obtiene una recompensa de 2. Sin embargo, si sombrea su oferta por debajo de 4, obtiene la segunda ranura a un costo de 0 por clic, produciendo un recompensa de 3. Dado que los agentes tienen la misma relevancia, la misma situación se mantiene en la regla RBR. Por lo tanto, la oferta veraz no es una estrategia dominante en ninguno de los formatos, y tampoco es un ex equilibrio de Nash. Para encontrar pagos que realicen un incentivo dominante RBB y RBR compatible con incentivos, podemos aplicar Holmstroms Lemma [9] (ver también el Capítulo 3 en Milgrom [15]). Bajo la restricción de que un postor con valor 0 por clic no paga nada (incluso si obtiene una ranura, que puede ocurrir si hay tantos espacios como los postores), este lema implica que hay una regla de pago única que logra dominante-Compatibilidad de incentivos de estrategia para cualquiera de las reglas de asignación. Para RBB, la ranura K asignada al postor se carga por clic kx i = k+1 (γi - 1 - γi) ˜x (i)+γk ˜x (k+1) (1) Tenga en cuenta que si k = n, ˜, ˜x (k + 1) = 0 Dado que no hay K + 1º postor. Para RBR, la ranura asignada al postor se carga por clic 1 ασ (k) kx i = k+1 (γi - 1 - γi) ˜r (i)+γk ˜r (k+1)!(2) Usando la regla de pago (2) y RBR, el subastador es consciente de los verdaderos ingresos de los postores (ya que revelan sus valores con sinceridad) y, por lo tanto, los clasifica de acuerdo con sus verdaderos ingresos. Mostramos en la Sección 3.3 que esta asignación es de hecho eficiente. Dado que el mecanismo de VCG es el mecanismo único que es eficiente, sincero y garantiza que los licitantes con valor 0 no pagan nada (por el teorema de laffont verde [8]), la regla RBR y el esquema de pago (2) constituyen exactamente el mecanismo VCG. En el mecanismo de VCG, un agente paga la externalidad que impone a los demás. Para comprender el pago (2) en este sentido, tenga en cuenta que el primer término es la utilidad adicional (debido a una mayor tasa de clics), los agentes en las ranuras K + 1 a K recibirían si todos fueran para subir una ranura;El último término es la utilidad que recibiría el agente con los ingresos K +1 ° obteniendo el último espacio en lugar de nada. El coeficiente principal simplemente reduce el pago de los agentes a un pago por clic.13 En un entorno dinámico con el segundo precio, puede haber un incentivo para ofertar más alto que el verdadero valor para agotar los presupuestos de los competidores. Este fenómeno se denomina comúnmente atasco de oferta o licitación antisocial [4].221 3.2 Análisis de equilibrio Para comprender la eficiencia y las propiedades de ingresos de los diversos formatos de subasta, primero debemos comprender qué clasificaciones de los postores ocurren en equilibrio con diferentes combinaciones de reglas de asignación y pago. El siguiente lema esencialmente se deriva del teorema de selección monotónica de Milgrom y Shannon [16]. Lema 1. En una subasta de RBB (RBR) con una regla de pago de segundo precio del Primer Primer, la oferta simétrica de equilibrio de Nash Bayes está aumentando estrictamente con valor (ingresos). Como consecuencia de este lema, encontramos que las subastas RBB y RBR asignan las ranuras con avidez por los valores e ingresos verdaderos de los agentes, respectivamente (ya sea utilizando las reglas de pago de segundo precio de Firstor). Esto será relevante en la Sección 3.3 a continuación. Para una regla de pago de primer precio, podemos derivar explícitamente las funciones de oferta de equilibrio simétrica de Bayes-Nash para subastas RBB y RBR. El propósito de este ejercicio es prestar información cualitativa sobre los parámetros que influyen en la oferta de los agentes y derivan fórmulas para los ingresos esperados en las subastas RBB y RBR para hacer una clasificación de ingresos de estas dos reglas de asignación (en la Sección 3.4). Sea G (y) la tasa de clics resultante esperada, en un equilibrio simétrico de la subasta RBB (con cualquier regla de pago), a un postor con valor y y relevancia α = 1. Sea h (y) la cantidad análoga para un postor con ingresos y y relevancia 1 en una subasta RBR. Por Lemma 1, un postor con valor y obtendrá la ranura K en una subasta RBB si Y es el KTH más alto de los valores realizados verdaderos. Lo mismo se aplica en una subasta RBR cuando Y es el KTH más alto de los verdaderos ingresos realizados. Deje que FX (y) sea la función de distribución para el valor, y FR (y) sea la función de distribución para los ingresos. ¡La probabilidad de que Y sea el KTH más alto de los valores de N es N - 1 K - 1!(1 - fx (y)) k - 1 fx (y) n - k, mientras que la probabilidad de que y sea la KTH más alta de los ingresos de N es la misma fórmula con FR reemplazando FX. Por lo tanto, tenemos g (y) = kx k = 1 γk n - 1 k - 1!(1 - fx (y)) k - 1 fx (y) N - K La función H es análoga a G con FR reemplazando FX. En las dos proposiciones que siguen, G y H son los derivados de G y H respectivamente. Omitimos la prueba de la próxima proposición, porque es casi idéntica a la derivación de la oferta de equilibrio en el caso de un solo elemento (ver Krishna [11], Proposición 2.2). Proposición 1. Las estrategias simétricas de equilibrio de bayes-nash en una subasta RBB de primer precio están dadas por ˜xb (x, α) = 1 g (x) z x 0 y g (y) dy el equilibrio de primer precio por encima de estrechamente el equilibrio del primer precio enEl modelo de ítems. Con un solo ítem G es la densidad del segundo valor más alto entre todos los valores de N Agent, mientras que en una subasta de ranura es una combinación ponderada de las densidades para los valores más altos, etc. más altos. Tenga en cuenta que la oferta simétrica de equilibrio de narración de bayes en una subasta RBB de primer precio no depende de la relevancia de los licitadores α. Para ver claramente por qué, tenga en cuenta que un postor elige una oferta B para maximizar el objetivo αG (˜x - 1 (b)) (x - b) y aquí α es solo un factor constante principal. Por lo tanto, soltarlo no cambia el conjunto de soluciones óptimas. Por lo tanto, la oferta de equilibrio depende solo del valor x y la función G, y G a su vez depende solo de la distribución acumulada marginal del valor FX. Entonces, en realidad solo este último debe ser de conocimiento común para los postores. Por otro lado, ahora veremos que se necesita información sobre relevancia para que los postores jueguen el equilibrio en la subasta RBR de primer precio. Por lo tanto, los requisitos informativos para una subasta RBB de primer precio son mucho más débiles que para una subasta RBR de primer precio: en la subasta RBB, un postor no necesita saber su propia relevancia, y no necesita saber ninguna información de distribución sobre la relevancia de otros para jugarel equilibrio. Nuevamente omitimos la próxima prueba de propuestas ya que es muy similar a la anterior. Proposición 2. Las estrategias simétricas de equilibrio de bayes-nash en una subasta RBR de primer precio están dadas por ˜xr (x, α) = 1 αH (αx) z αx 0 y h (y) aquí se puede ver que la oferta de equilibrio está aumentando conX, pero no necesariamente con α. Sin embargo, esto no debería ser una gran preocupación para el subastador, porque en cualquier caso los ingresos declarados en equilibrio siempre aumentan en los ingresos verdaderos. Sería interesante obtener las ofertas de equilibrio al usar una regla de pago de segundo precio, pero parece que las ecuaciones diferenciales resultantes para este caso no tienen una solución analítica ordenada. No obstante, las mismas conclusiones sobre los requisitos informativos de las reglas RBB y RBR aún se mantienen, como se puede ver simplemente inspeccionando la función objetivo asociada con un problema de licitación de agentes para el segundo caso de precio.3.3 Eficiencia Una subasta de ranura es eficiente si en equilibrio se maximiza la suma de los ingresos de los postores de sus ranuras asignadas. Usando la simetría como criterio de selección de equilibrio, encontramos que la subasta RBB no es eficiente con ninguna regla de pago. Reclamación 2. La subasta RBB no es eficiente con el primer o segundo precio. Ejemplo. Hay dos agentes y una ranura, con γ1 = 1. El agente 1 tiene un valor de x1 = 6 por clic y relevancia α1 = 1/2. El agente 2 tiene un valor de x2 = 4 por clic y relevancia α2 = 1. Por Lemma 1, los agentes se clasifican con avidez por valor. Por lo tanto, el Agente 1 obtiene la ranura solitaria, para un ingreso total de 3 de los agentes. Sin embargo, es más eficiente asignar la ranura al Agente 2, para un ingreso total de 4. Los ejemplos con más agentes o más ranuras son fáciles de construir a lo largo de la misma línea. Por otro lado, bajo nuestras suposiciones sobre cómo la tasa de clics disminuye con el rango más bajo, la subasta RBR es eficiente con cualquier regla de pago.222 Teorema 1. La subasta RBR es eficiente con las reglas de pagos de primer o segundo precio. Prueba. Dado que por el Lema 1, las ofertas de equilibrio de los agentes están creciendo funciones de sus ingresos en la subasta RBR, las espacios se asignan con codicia de acuerdo con los verdaderos ingresos. Sea σ una asignación no gruesa. Luego hay ranuras s, t con s <t y rσ (s) <rσ (t). Podemos cambiar los agentes en las tragamonedas S y T para obtener una nueva asignación, y la diferencia entre los ingresos totales en esta nueva asignación y las asignaciones originales de ingresos totales es `γtrσ (S) + γSRσ (t) ´ -` γSRσ (S) + γtrσ (t) ´ = (γs - γt) `rσ (t) - rσ (s) ´ Ambos términos paréntesis anteriores son positivos. Por lo tanto, el cambio ha aumentado los ingresos totales para los postores. Si continuamos realizando tales interruptores, eventualmente alcanzaremos una asignación codiciosa de mayores ingresos que la asignación inicial. Dado que la asignación inicial era arbitraria, se deduce que una asignación codiciosa siempre es eficiente y, por lo tanto, la asignación de subastas RBR es eficiente. Tenga en cuenta que la suposición de que la tasa de clics decae montonicamente por los mismos factores γ1 ,..., γk para todos los agentes es crucial para este resultado. Un esquema de asignación codiciosa no necesariamente encuentra una solución eficiente si las tasas de clics están disminuyendo monotónicamente de manera independiente para cada agente.3.4 Ingresos Para obtener posibles clasificaciones de ingresos para los diferentes formatos de subasta, primero notamos que cuando la regla de asignación se fija a RBB, luego utilizando una regla de pago de primer precio, segundo precio o veraz conduce a los mismos ingresos esperados en unSymétrico, aumentando el equilibrio de bayes-nash. Debido a que una subasta de RBB clasifica a los agentes por sus valores verdaderos en equilibrio para cualquiera de estas reglas de pago (por Lemma 1), se deduce que los ingresos esperados son los mismos para todas estas reglas de pago, siguiendo argumentos que son prácticamente idénticos a los utilizados para establecer ingresosEquivalencia en el caso único (ver, p. Proposición 3.1 en Krishna [11]). Lo mismo se mantiene para las subastas RBR;Sin embargo, la clasificación de ingresos de las reglas de asignación RBB y RBR aún no está clara. Debido a este principio de equivalencia de ingresos, podemos elegir la regla de pago que sea más conveniente con el fin de hacer comparaciones de ingresos. Usando las Propuestas 1 y 2, es una cuestión simple derivar fórmulas para los ingresos esperados bajo ambas reglas de asignación. El pago de un agente en una subasta RBB es MB (x, α) = αg (x) ˜xV (x, α) El ingreso esperado es entonces n · e ˆ mV (x, a) ˜, donde se toma la expectativacon respecto a la densidad articular del valor y la relevancia. La fórmula de ingresos esperada para las subastas RBR es completamente análoga usando ˜xr (x, α) y la función H. Con estos en la mano podemos obtener clasificaciones de ingresos para números específicos de postores y espacios, y distribuciones específicas sobre valores y relevancia. Reclamación 3. Para K, N y γ1 fijos ,..., γk, no es posible la clasificación de ingresos de RBB y RBR para una densidad arbitraria f.Ejemplo. Suponga que hay 2 postores, 2 ranuras, y que γ1 = 1, γ2 = 1/2. Suponga que los pares de valor de valor se distribuyen uniformemente sobre [0, 1] × [0, 1]. Para tal distribución con una fórmula de forma cerrada, es más conveniente usar las fórmulas de ingresos que se acaban de derivar. RBB domina RBR en términos de ingresos para estos parámetros. La fórmula para los ingresos esperados en una subasta RBB produce 1/12, mientras que para las subastas RBR tenemos 7/108. Suponga en su lugar que con la probabilidad 1/2 un par de agentes valoreReLeVance es (1, 1/2), y que con probabilidad 1/2 es (1/2, 1). En este escenario es más conveniente atraer a las fórmulas (1) y (2). En una subasta veraz, el segundo agente siempre pagará 0. Según (1), en una subasta de RBB veraz, el primer agente realiza un pago esperado de e ˆ (γ1 - γ2) aσ (1) xσ (2) ˜ = 1 2 e ˆ aσ (1) ˜ e ˆ xσ (2) ˜ donde hemos utilizado el hecho de que el valor y la relevancia se distribuyen independientemente para diferentes agentes. La relevancia esperada del agente con el valor más alto es e ˆ aσ (1) ˜ = 5/8. El segundo valor más alto esperado también es e ˆ xσ (2) ˜ = 5/8. Los ingresos esperados para una subasta RBB aquí son entonces 25/128. Según (2), en una subasta RBR sincera, el primer agente realiza un pago esperado de e ˆ (γ1 - γ2) rσ (2) ˜ = 1 2 e ˆ rσ (2) ˜ En expectativa, el segundo ingreso más alto es e ˆRσ (2) ˜ = 1/2, por lo que los ingresos esperados para una subasta RBR son 1/4. Por lo tanto, en este caso, la subasta de RBR produce mayores ingresos esperados.1415 Este ejemplo sugiere la siguiente conjetura: cuando el valor y la relevancia no están correlacionados o están correlacionados positivamente, RBB domina RBR en términos de ingresos. Cuando el valor y la relevancia se correlacionan negativamente, RBR domina.4. Información completa en subastas de tragamonedas típicas como las administradas por Yahoo!Y Google, los postores pueden ajustar sus ofertas hacia arriba o hacia abajo en cualquier momento. Como B¨orgers et al.[2] y Edelman et al.[6] han notado que esto puede verse como un proceso de tiempo continuo en el que los postores aprenden las ofertas de los demás. Si el proceso estabiliza el resultado, se puede modelar como un equilibrio de Nash en estrategias puras del juego estático de información completa de información completa, ya que cada postor jugará la mejor respuesta a las otras ofertas.16 Parece especialmente apropiado paraDiseño de subasta de espacio de Yahoo. Cuando todas las ofertas son 14 para ser completamente rigurosas y consistentes con nuestros supuestos iniciales, deberíamos haber construido una densidad de probabilidad continua con un soporte total sobre un dominio apropiado. Tomar el dominio para ser, p.[0, 1] × [0, 1] y una densidad continua con soporte completo que se concentra suficientemente alrededor (1, 1/2) y (1/2, 1), con una masa aproximadamente igual alrededor de ambos, produciría la mismaconclusión.15 Reclamación 3 debe servir como una palabra de precaución, porque Feng et al.[7] considere a través de sus simulaciones que con una distribución normal bivariada sobre los pares de valor de valor, y con 5 ranuras, 15 postores y δ = 2, RBR domina RBB en términos de ingresos para cualquier nivel de correlación entre valor y relevancia. Sin embargo, suponen que el comportamiento de licitación en una subasta de ranura de segundo precio puede ser bien aproximado por la licitación veraz.16 No afirmamos que los postores realmente aprendan información privada de los demás (valor y relevancia), solo que para un conjunto estable de ofertas hay un equilibrio correspondiente del juego de información completa.223 hecho público. Google mantiene las ofertas privadas, pero la experimentación puede permitir que uno descubra otras ofertas, especialmente porque el segundo precio revela automáticamente a un agente que la oferta del agente clasificada directamente debajo de él.4.1 Análisis de equilibrio En esta sección preguntamos si existe un equilibrio NASH de estrategia pura en una subasta de ranura RBB o RBR, con precios de primer o segundo. Antes de lidiar con el caso de primer precio, existe un problema técnico que involucra lazos. En nuestro modelo, permitimos que las ofertas sean números reales no negativos para la conveniencia matemática, pero esto puede volverse problemático porque entonces no hay una oferta que sea solo más alta que otra. Cepilamos tales problemas asumiendo que un agente puede ofertar infinitesimalmente más alto que otro. Esto es impreciso, pero nos permite centrarnos en la intuición detrás del resultado que sigue. Ver Reny [17] para un tratamiento completo de tales problemas. Para el resto del documento, suponemos que hay tantos espacios como los postores. El siguiente resultado muestra que no puede haber un equilibrio NASH de estrategia pura con el primer precio.17 Tenga en cuenta que el argumento es válido para las reglas de asignación RBB y RBR. Para RBB, las ofertas deben interpretarse como valores declarados, y para RBR como ingresos declarados. Teorema 2. No existe información completa de equilibrio de Nash en estrategias puras en la subasta de ranuras de primer precio, para cualquier posible valor de los agentes, ya sea utilizando una regla de asignación RBB o RBR. Prueba. Sea σ: [k] → [n] la asignación de ranuras a los agentes resultantes de sus ofertas. Deje que Ri y Bi sean los ingresos y la oferta del agente clasificado con Ith, respectivamente. Tenga en cuenta que no podemos tener bi> bi+1, o el agente en la ranura puedo hacer una desviación rentable al ofertar bi -> bi+1 para lo suficientemente pequeño> 0. Esto no cambia su asignación, pero aumenta sus ganancias. Por lo tanto, debemos tener BI = Bi+1 (es decir, con un licitador infinitesimalmente más alto que el otro). Dado que esto es válido para dos licitadores consecutivos, se deduce que en un equilibrio de Nash, todos los licitantes deben estar ofertando 0 (ya que el postor clasificó la última vez que coincide con la oferta directamente debajo de él, que es 0 por defecto porque no existe dicha oferta). Pero esto es imposible: considere al postor clasificado por última vez. La identidad de este postor siempre es clara dada la regla determinista de vínculo. Este postor puede obtener el primer lugar y aumentar sus ingresos mediante (γ1 −γk) RK> 0 haciendo una oferta> 0, y para lo suficientemente pequeño esto es necesariamente una desviación rentable. Por lo tanto, no hay equilibrio de Nash en estrategias puras. Por otro lado, encontramos que en una subasta de ranura de segundo precio puede haber una multitud de pura estrategia Nash Equilibrios. Los siguientes dos lemas dan condiciones que caracterizan las asignaciones que pueden ocurrir como resultado de un perfil de equilibrio de BIDS, dados los valores e ingresos de agentes fijos. Entonces, si podemos exhibir una asignación que satisfaga estas condiciones, debe existir al menos un equilibrio. Primero consideramos el caso RBR.17 B¨orgers et al.[2] han demostrado este resultado en un modelo con tres postores y tres espacios, y generalizamos su argumento. Edelman et al.[6] también señala este fenómeno de no existencia. Solo ilustran el hecho con un ejemplo porque el resultado es bastante inmediato. Lema 2. Dada una asignación σ, existe un perfil de equilibrio Nash de BIDS B que conduce a σ en una subasta de ranura RBR de segundo precio si y solo si „1-γi γj+1« rσ (i) ≤ rσ (j) para 1 ≤ j≤ n - 2 e i ≥ j + 2. Prueba. Existe un vector B deseado que constituye un equilibrio de Nash si y solo si se puede satisfacer el siguiente conjunto de desigualdades (las variables son πi y bj): πi ≥ γj (rσ (i) - bj) ∀i, ∀j <J <i (3) πi ≥ γj (rσ (i) - bj+1) ∀i, ∀j> i (4) πi = γi (rσ (i) - bi+1) ∀i (5) bi ≥ bi+1 11 ≤ I ≤ n - 1 (6) πi ≥ 0, bi ≥ 0 ∀i aquí rσ (i) son los ingresos de la ranura I asignada por agente, y πi y bi pueden interpretarse como este excedente de agentes y declararse ingresos, respectivamente. Primero argumentamos que las restricciones (6) pueden eliminarse, porque las desigualdades anteriores pueden satisfacerse si y solo si las desigualdades sin (6) pueden ser satisfechas. La dirección necesaria es inmediata. Suponga que tenemos un vector (π, b) que satisface todas las desigualdades anteriores excepto (6). Luego hay algunos para el cual Bi <bi+1. Construya un nuevo vector (π, b) idéntico al original, excepto con Bi+1 = Bi. Ahora tenemos BI = BI+1. Un agente en la ranura K <i ve el precio de la ranura I disminuye de bi+1 a bi+1 = bi, pero esto no hace que se prefiera más que k a este agente porque tenemos πk ≥ γi - 1 (rσ (k) - bi) ≥ γi (rσ (k) - bi) = γi (rσ (k) −bi+1) (es decir, porque el agente en la ranura k originalmente no prefería la ranura I - 1 al precio bi, no preferiráSlot I en Price Bi). Un argumento similar se aplica a los agentes en las ranuras k> i + 1. El agente en la ranura Veo que el precio de esta ranura disminuye, lo que solo lo hace más preferido. Finalmente, el agente en la ranura I + 1 no ve cambios en el precio de ninguna ranura, por lo que su ranura sigue siendo más preferida. Por lo tanto, las desigualdades (3)-(5) siguen siendo válidas en (π, b). Primero hacemos este cambio al BI+1 donde Bi <Bi+1 y el índice I son más pequeños. Luego aplicamos recursivamente el cambio hasta que eventualmente obtenemos un vector que satisfaga todas las desigualdades. Ignoramos con seguridad las desigualdades (6) a partir de ahora. Por el lema de Farkas, las desigualdades restantes pueden satisfacerse si y solo si no hay vector z tal que x i, j (γj rσ (i)) zσ (i) j> 0 x i> j γjzσ (i) j +X i <j γj - 1zσ (i) j - 1 ≤ 0 ∀j (7) x j zσ (i) j ≤ 0 ∀i (8) zσ (i) j ≥ 0 ∀i, ∀j = i zσ (i) Libero ∀i Observe que una variable de la forma Zσ (i) I parece como máximo una vez en una restricción de tipo (8), por lo que tal variable nunca puede ser positiva. Además, zσ (i) 1 = 0 para todo i = 1 por restricción (7), ya que tales variables nunca aparecen con otra de la forma zσ (i) i. Ahora, si deseamos elevar Zσ (i) J por encima de 0 por una unidad para J = I, debemos bajar zσ (i) I por una unidad debido a la restricción de tipo (8). Porque γjrσ (i) ≤ γirσ (i) para i <j, elevando 224 zσ (i) j con i <j mientras ajusta otras variables para mantener la viabilidad no puede hacer el objetivo p i, j (γjrσ (i)) zσ (i) j positivo. Si este objetivo es positivo, esto se debe a algún componente Zσ (i) J con i> j siendo positivo. Ahora para las restricciones de tipo (7), si i> j entonces zσ (i) j aparece con zσ (j - 1) j - 1 (para 1 <j <n). Entonces, para elevar las unidades γ - 1 j variables anteriores y mantener la viabilidad, debemos (i) reducir zσ (i) I por unidades γ - 1 J, y (ii) Zσ (j - 1) j - 1 por γ−1 J - 1 unidades. Por lo tanto, si se mantienen las siguientes desigualdades: rσ (i) ≤ „γi γj« rσ (i) + rσ (j - 1) (9) para 2 ≤ j ≤ n - 1 e i> j, elevando algo de zσ (i) jcon i> j no puede hacer que el objetivo sea positivo, y no hay Z que satisfaga todas las desigualdades anteriores. Por el contrario, si alguna desigualdad (9) no se mantiene, el objetivo puede ser positivo al elevar el Zσ (i) J correspondiente y ajustar otras variables para que la viabilidad se mantenga simplemente. Por un ligero reindeo, las desigualdades (9) producen la declaración del teorema. El caso RBB es completamente análogo. Lema 3. Dada una asignación σ, existe un perfil de equilibrio Nash de BIDS B que conduce a σ en una subasta de ranura RBB de segundo precio si y solo si „1-γi γj+1« xσ (i) ≤ xσ (j) para 1 ≤ j≤ n - 2 e i ≥ j + 2. Boceto de prueba. La técnica de prueba es la misma que en el lema anterior. El equilibrio de Nash deseado existe si y solo si se puede satisfacer un conjunto relacionado de desigualdades;Por el lema de Farkas, esto ocurre si y solo si no se puede satisfacer un conjunto alternativo de desigualdades. Las condiciones que determinan si este último se mantiene en la declaración del lema. Los dos lemas anteriores conducen inmediatamente al siguiente resultado. Teorema 3. Siempre existe una información completa de equilibrio de Nash en estrategias puras en la subasta de ranura RBB de segundo precio. Siempre existe una información completa eficiente, equilibrio de Nash en estrategias puras en la subasta de ranura RBR del segundo precio. Prueba. Primero considere RBB. Supongamos que los agentes se clasifican de acuerdo con sus verdaderos valores. Dado que xσ (i) ≤ xσ (j) para i> j, se satisface el sistema de desigualdades en el lema 3, y la asignación es el resultado de algún perfil de oferta de equilibrio Nash. Por el mismo tipo de argumento, pero apelando a Lemma 2 para RBR, existe un perfil de oferta de equilibrio Nash de modo que los postores se clasifiquen de acuerdo con sus verdaderos ingresos. Por el Teorema 1, esta última asignación es eficiente. Este teorema establece la existencia pero no la singularidad. De hecho, esperamos que en muchos casos haya múltiples asignaciones (y, por lo tanto, equilibrios) que satisfagan las condiciones de Lemmas 2 y 3. En particular, no todos los equilibrios de una subasta RBR de segundo precio serán eficientes. Por ejemplo, según Lemma 2, con dos agentes y dos ranuras, cualquier asignación puede surgir en un equilibrio RBR porque no se aplican restricciones. Los teoremas 2 y 3 tomados en conjunto proporcionan una posible explicación para el cambio de yahoo! S del primer a segundo precio. Vimos en la Sección 3.1 que esto no induce la veracidad de los postores. Con el primer precio, siempre habrá algún postor que se sienta obligado a ajustar su oferta. El segundo precio es más conveniente porque se puede alcanzar un equilibrio, y esto reduce el costo de la gestión de ofertas.4.2 Eficiencia para una regla de asignación dada, llamamos a la asignación que resultaría si los postores informaran sus valores sinceramente la asignación estándar. Por lo tanto, en el estándar, los licitadores de asignación de RBB están clasificados por valores verdaderos, y en la asignación estándar de RBR están clasificados por ingresos verdaderos. Según Lemmas 2 y 3, una clasificación que resulta de un perfil de equilibrio NASH solo puede desviarse de la asignación estándar al tener agentes con valores relativamente similares o lugares de cambio de ingresos. Es decir, si Ri> rj entonces con el agente RBR J puede clasificarse más alto que I solo si la relación RJ/RI es suficientemente grande;Del mismo modo para RBB. Esto sugiere que el valor de una asignación de equilibrio no puede diferir demasiado del valor obtenido en la asignación estándar, y los siguientes teoremas confirman esto. Para una asignación σ de ranuras a los agentes, denotamos su valor total por F (σ) = Pn I = 1 γirσ (i). Denotamos por G (σ) = Pn I = 1 γixσ (i) Valor de asignación σs al suponer que todos los agentes tienen relevancia idéntica, normalizada a 1. Sea l = min i = 1, ..., n - 1 min  γi+1 γi, 1 - γi+2 γi+1 ff (donde por defecto γn+1 = 0). Deje que ηx y ηr sean las asignaciones estándar al usar RBB y RBR, respectivamente. Teorema 4. Para una asignación σ que resulta de un equilibrio de Purestrategy Nash de una subasta de ranura RBR de segundo precio, tenemos F (σ) ≥ LF (ηr). Prueba. Numeramos a los agentes para que el agente I tenga los ingresos más altos, por lo que R1 ≥ R2 ≥...≥ rn. Por lo tanto, la asignación estándar tiene valor F (ηr) = Pn I = 1 γiri. Para probar el teorema, haremos un uso repetido del hecho de que P k akp k bk ≥ visón ak bk cuando el ak y bk sean positivos. Tenga en cuenta que según Lemma 2, si el agente I se encuentra al menos dos ranuras debajo de la ranura J, entonces rσ (j) ≥ ri 1 - γj+2 γj+1. Puede ser el caso de que para alguna ranura i, tenemos σ (i)> i y para ranuras k> i + 1 tenemos σ (k)> i. Luego decimos que la ranura está invertida. Sea s el conjunto de agentes con índices al menos i + 1;Hay n - I de estos. Si la ranura I está invertida, está ocupada por algún agente de S. También todas las ranuras estrictamente más bajas que i + 1 deben estar ocupadas por los agentes restantes de S, ya que σ (k)> i para k ≥ i + 2. El agente en la ranura i + 1 debe tener un índice σ (i + 1) ≤ i (tenga en cuenta esto significa que la ranura i + 1 no se puede invertir). Ahora hay dos casos. En el primer caso tenemos σ (i) = i + 1. Entonces γirσ (i)+γi+1rσ (i+1) γiri+γi+1ri+1 ≥ γi+1ri+γiri+1 γiri+γi+1ri+1 ≥ min  γi+1 γi, γi γi+1 ff = =γi+1 γi En el segundo caso tenemos σ (i)> i+1. Entonces, dado que todos los agentes en S excepto el que está en la ranura, me acuesto estrictamente debajo de la ranura i + 1, y 225 el agente en la ranura I no es el agente i + 1, debe ser que el agente i + 1 esté en una ranura estrictamente debajo de la ranura i I+1. Esto significa que está al menos dos ranuras debajo del agente que realmente ocupa la ranura I, y por Lemma 2 tenemos rσ (i) ≥ Ri+1 1 - γi+2 γi+1. Por lo tanto, γirσ (i)+γi+1rσ (i+1) γiri+γi+1ri+1 ≥ γi+1ri+γirσ (i) γiri+γi+1ri+1 ≥ min  γi+1 γi, 1 - γi++2 γi+1 ff Si la ranura I no está invertida, entonces, por un lado, podemos tener σ (i) ≤ I, en cuyo caso rσ (i)/ri ≥ 1. Por otro lado, podemos tener σ (i)> i, pero hay algún agente con índice j ≤ i que se encuentra al menos dos ranuras debajo de la ranura i. Luego por Lemma 2, rσ (i) ≥ rj 1 - γi+2 γi+1 ≥ ri 1 - γi+2 γi+1. Escribimos i ∈ I si la ranura I está invertida, e i ∈ I si ni yo ni i - 1 están invertidas. Según nuestros argumentos anteriores, no se pueden invertir dos ranuras consecutivas, por lo que podemos escribir F (σ) F (γr) = P i∈I `γirσ (i) + γi + 1rσ (i + 1) ´ + p i∈I γirσ (i) p i∈I (γiri+γi+1ri+1)+p i∈I γiri ≥ min  min i∈I  γirσ (i)+γi+1rσ (i+1) γiri+γi+1ri+1 ff, min i∈I  γirσ (i) γiri FFFF ≥ L y esto completa la prueba. Tenga en cuenta que para RBR, el valor estándar también es el valor eficiente del Teorema 1. También tenga en cuenta que para un modelo de desintegración exponencial, L = min ˘1 δ, 1 - 1 Δ ¯. Con δ = 1.428 (ver Sección 2.1), el factor es L ≈ 1/3.34, por lo que el valor total en un equilibrio NASH de estrategia pura de una subasta de ranura RBR de segundo precio siempre está dentro de un factor de 3.34 del valor eficiente contal descuento. Nuevamente para RBB tenemos un resultado análogo. Teorema 5. Para una asignación σ que resulta de un equilibrio de Purestrategy Nash de una subasta de ranura RBB de segundo precio, tenemos G (σ) ≥ Lg (ηx). Boceto de prueba. Simplemente sustituya los valores de los postor por los ingresos del postor en la prueba del teorema 4 y apele a Lemma 3. 5. Conclusiones Este documento analizó versiones estilizadas de los diseños de subastas de ranura que actualmente utilizan Yahoo!y Google, a saber, el rango por BID (RBB) y el rango por ingresos (RBR), respectivamente. También consideramos las reglas de precios de primera y segunda junto con cada una de estas reglas de asignación, ya que ambas se han utilizado históricamente. Primero estudiamos la configuración a corto plazo con información incompleta, correspondiente al caso donde los agentes acaban de abordar el mecanismo. Nuestro análisis de equilibrio reveló que RBB tiene requisitos informativos mucho más débiles que RBR, porque los postores no necesitan conocer ninguna información sobre relevancia (incluso la suya) para jugar el equilibrio de Bayes-Nash. Sin embargo, RBR conduce a una asignación eficiente en equilibrio, mientras que RBB no. Demostramos que para una distribución arbitraria sobre el valor y la relevancia, no es posible una clasificación de ingresos de RBB y RBR. Esperamos que las herramientas que usamos para establecer estos resultados (equivalencia de ingresos, la forma de equilibrios de primer precio, las reglas de pagos veraces) ayuden a otros que desean obtener más análisis de subastas de tragamonedas. También estudiamos el caso a largo plazo donde los agentes han experimentado con sus ofertas y cada uno se resolvió en uno que consideran óptimo. Argumentamos que un conjunto estable de ofertas en este entorno puede modelarse como un equilibrio Nash de estrategia pura del juego estático de información completa. Demostramos que no existe un equilibrio de estrategia pura con RBB o RBR usando el primer precio, pero que con el segundo precio siempre existe tal equilibrio (en el caso de RBR, un equilibrio eficiente). En general, el segundo precio permite múltiples equilibrios de estrategia pura, pero demostramos que el valor de tales equilibrios diverge solo por un factor constante del valor obtenido si todos los agentes ofertan sinceramente (que en el caso de RBR es el valor eficiente).6. El trabajo futuro que introduce limitaciones presupuestarias en el modelo es un próximo paso natural para el trabajo futuro. La complicación aquí radica en el hecho de que los presupuestos a menudo se establecen para campañas enteras en lugar de palabras clave únicas. Suponiendo que la elección óptima del presupuesto se puede hacer independiente de la elección de oferta para una palabra clave específica, se puede demostrar que es una estrategia dominante informar este presupuesto óptimo con la oferta. El problema es determinar que las ofertas y los presupuestos pueden optimizarse por separado, o encontrar un modelo plausible donde derivar ofertas de equilibrio y presupuestos juntos es manejable. Identificar una condición en la distribución sobre el valor y la relevancia que realmente produce una clasificación de ingresos de RBB y RBR (como la correlación entre valor y relevancia, tal vez) produciría una caracterización más satisfactoria de sus propiedades de ingresos relativos. Colocar límites en los ingresos obtenidos en un equilibrio de información completa también es una pregunta relevante. Debido a que el caso de información incompleta es una generalización tan cercana del modelo de subasta de ítems único más básico, sería interesante ver qué resultados estándar de la teoría de subastas de un solo ítem (por ejemplo, resultados con licitadores de reacio en el riesgo, un número endógeno de postores,Las asimetrías, etc.) se generalizan automáticamente y que no, para comprender completamente las diferencias estructurales entre las subastas de un solo elemento y las ranuras. Agradecimientos David Pennock proporcionó una valiosa orientación a lo largo de este proyecto. También me gustaría agradecer a David Parkes por sus útiles comentarios.7. Referencias [1] Z. Abrams.

        "The RBR auction is efficient with either first- or second-price payments rules.",
        "Proof.",
        "Since by Lemma 1 the agents equilibrium bids are increasing functions of their revenues in the RBR auction, slots are allocated greedily according to true revenues.",
        "Let σ be a non-greedy allocation.",
        "Then there are slots s, t with s < t and rσ(s) < rσ(t).",
        "We can switch the agents in slots s and t to obtain a new allocation, and the difference between the total revenue in this new allocation and the original allocations total revenue is ` γtrσ(s) + γsrσ(t) ´ − ` γsrσ(s) + γtrσ(t) ´ = (γs − γt) ` rσ(t) − rσ(s) ´ Both parenthesized terms above are positive.",
        "Hence the switch has increased the total revenue to the bidders.",
        "If we continue to perform such switches, we will eventually reach a greedy allocation of greater revenue than the initial allocation.",
        "Since the initial allocation was arbitrary, it follows that a greedy allocation is always efficient, and hence the RBR auctions allocation is efficient.",
        "Note that the assumption that clickthrough rate decays montonically by the same factors γ1, . . . , γK for all agents is crucial to this result.",
        "A greedy allocation scheme does not necessarily find an efficient solution if the clickthrough rates are monotonically decreasing in an independent fashion for each agent. 3.4 Revenue To obtain possible revenue rankings for the different auction formats, we first note that when the allocation rule is fixed to RBB, then using either a first-price, second-price, or truthful payment rule leads to the same expected revenue in a symmetric, increasing Bayes-Nash equilibrium.",
        "Because a RBB auction ranks agents by their true values in equilibrium for any of these payment rules (by Lemma 1), it follows that expected revenue is the same for all these payment rules, following arguments that are virtually identical to those used to establish revenue equivalence in the singleitem case (see e.g.",
        "Proposition 3.1 in Krishna [11]).",
        "The same holds for RBR auctions; however, the revenue ranking of the RBB and RBR allocation rules is still unclear.",

[7] find through their simulations that with a bivariate normal distribution over value-relevance pairs, and with 5 slots, 15 bidders, and δ = 2, RBR dominates RBB in terms of revenue for any level of correlation between value and relevance.",

        "There exists no complete information Nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the first-price slot auction, for any possible values of the agents, whether using a RBB or RBR allocation rule.",
        "Proof.",
        "Let σ : [K] → [N] be the allocation of slots to the agents resulting from their bids.",
        "Let ri and bi be the revenue and bid of the agent ranked ith , respectively.",
        "Note that we cannot have bi > bi+1, or else the agent in slot i can make a profitable deviation by instead bidding bi − > bi+1 for small enough > 0.",
        "This does not change its allocation, but increases its profit.",
        "Hence we must have bi = bi+1 (i.e. with one bidder bidding infinitesimally higher than the other).",
        "Since this holds for any two consecutive bidders, it follows that in a Nash equilibrium all bidders must be bidding 0 (since the bidder ranked last matches the bid directly below him, which is 0 by default because there is no such bid).",
        "But this is impossible: consider the bidder ranked last.",
        "The identity of this bidder is always clear given the deterministic tie-breaking rule.",
        "This bidder can obtain the top spot and increase his revenue by (γ1 −γK)rK > 0 by bidding some > 0, and for small enough this is necessarily a profitable deviation.",
        "Hence there is no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies.",
        "On the other hand, we find that in a second-price slot auction there can be a multitude of pure strategy Nash equilibria.",
        "The next two lemmas give conditions that characterize the allocations that can occur as a result of an equilibrium profile of bids, given fixed agent values and revenues.",
        "Then if we can exhibit an allocation that satisfies these conditions, there must exist at least one equilibrium.",
        "We first consider the RBR case. 17 B¨orgers et al. [2] have proven this result in a model with three bidders and three slots, and we generalize their argument.",
        "Edelman et al. [6] also point out this non-existence phenomenon.",
        "They only illustrate the fact with an example because the result is quite immediate.",
        "Lemma 2.",
        "Given an allocation σ, there exists a Nash equilibrium profile of bids b leading to σ in a second-price RBR slot auction if and only if „ 1 − γi γj+1 « rσ(i) ≤ rσ(j) for 1 ≤ j ≤ N − 2 and i ≥ j + 2.",
        "Proof.",
        "There exists a desired vector b which constitutes a Nash equilibrium if and only if the following set of inequalities can be satisfied (the variables are the πi and bj): πi ≥ γj(rσ(i) − bj) ∀i, ∀j < i (3) πi ≥ γj(rσ(i) − bj+1) ∀i, ∀j > i (4) πi = γi(rσ(i) − bi+1) ∀i (5) bi ≥ bi+1 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1 (6) πi ≥ 0, bi ≥ 0 ∀i Here rσ(i) is the revenue of the agent allocated slot i, and πi and bi may be interpreted as this agents surplus and declared revenue, respectively.",
        "We first argue that constraints (6) can be removed, because the inequalities above can be satisfied if and only if the inequalities without (6) can be satisfied.",
        "The necessary direction is immediate.",
        "Assume we have a vector (π, b) which satisfies all inequalities above except (6).",
        "Then there is some i for which bi < bi+1.",
        "Construct a new vector (π, b ) identical to the original except with bi+1 = bi.",
        "We now have bi = bi+1.",
        "An agent in slot k < i sees the price of slot i decrease from bi+1 to bi+1 = bi, but this does not make i more preferred than k to this agent because we have πk ≥ γi−1(rσ(k) − bi) ≥ γi(rσ(k) − bi) = γi(rσ(k) −bi+1) (i.e. because the agent in slot k did not originally prefer slot i − 1 at price bi, he will not prefer slot i at price bi).",
        "A similar argument applies for agents in slots k > i + 1.",
        "The agent in slot i sees the price of this slot go down, which only makes it more preferred.",
        "Finally, the agent in slot i + 1 sees no change in the price of any slot, so his slot remains most preferred.",
        "Hence inequalities (3)-(5) remain valid at (π, b ).",
        "We first make this change to the bi+1 where bi < bi+1 and index i is smallest.",
        "We then recursively apply the change until we eventually obtain a vector that satisfies all inequalities.",
        "We safely ignore inequalities (6) from now on.",
        "By the Farkas lemma, the remaining inequalities can be satisfied if and only if there is no vector z such that X i,j (γj rσ(i)) zσ(i)j > 0 X i>j γjzσ(i)j + X i<j γj−1zσ(i)j−1 ≤ 0 ∀j (7) X j zσ(i)j ≤ 0 ∀i (8) zσ(i)j ≥ 0 ∀i, ∀j = i zσ(i)i free ∀i Note that a variable of the form zσ(i)i appears at most once in a constraint of type (8), so such a variable can never be positive.",
        "Also, zσ(i)1 = 0 for all i = 1 by constraint (7), since such variables never appear with another of the form zσ(i)i.",
        "Now if we wish to raise zσ(i)j above 0 by one unit for j = i, we must lower zσ(i)i by one unit because of the constraint of type (8).",
        "Because γjrσ(i) ≤ γirσ(i) for i < j, raising 224 zσ(i)j with i < j while adjusting other variables to maintain feasibility cannot make the objective P i,j(γjrσ(i))zσ(i)j positive.",
        "If this objective is positive, then this is due to some component zσ(i)j with i > j being positive.",
        "Now for the constraints of type (7), if i > j then zσ(i)j appears with zσ(j−1)j−1 (for 1 < j < N).",
        "So to raise the former variable γ−1 j units and maintain feasibility, we must (I) lower zσ(i)i by γ−1 j units, and (II) lower zσ(j−1)j−1 by γ−1 j−1 units.",
        "Hence if the following inequalities hold: rσ(i) ≤ „ γi γj « rσ(i) + rσ(j−1) (9) for 2 ≤ j ≤ N − 1 and i > j, raising some zσ(i)j with i > j cannot make the objective positive, and there is no z that satisfies all inequalities above.",
        "Conversely, if some inequality (9) does not hold, the objective can be made positive by raising the corresponding zσ(i)j and adjusting other variables so that feasibility is just maintained.",
        "By a slight reindexing, inequalities (9) yield the statement of the theorem.",
        "The RBB case is entirely analogous.",
        "Lemma 3.",
        "Given an allocation σ, there exists a Nash equilibrium profile of bids b leading to σ in a second-price RBB slot auction if and only if „ 1 − γi γj+1 « xσ(i) ≤ xσ(j) for 1 ≤ j ≤ N − 2 and i ≥ j + 2.",
        "Proof Sketch.",
        "The proof technique is the same as in the previous lemma.",
        "The desired Nash equilibrium exists if and only if a related set of inequalities can be satisfied; by the Farkas lemma, this occurs if and only if an alternate set of inequalities cannot be satisfied.",
        "The conditions that determine whether the latter holds are given in the statement of the lemma.",
        "The two lemmas above immediately lead to the following result.",
        "Theorem 3.",
        "There always exists a complete information Nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the second-price RBB slot auction.",
        "There always exists an efficient complete information Nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the secondprice RBR slot auction.",
        "Proof.",
        "First consider RBB.",
        "Suppose agents are ranked according to their true values.",
        "Since xσ(i) ≤ xσ(j) for i > j, the system of inequalities in Lemma 3 is satisfied, and the allocation is the result of some Nash equilibrium bid profile.",
        "By the same type of argument but appealing to Lemma 2 for RBR, there exists a Nash equilibrium bid profile such that bidders are ranked according to their true revenues.",
        "By Theorem 1, this latter allocation is efficient.",
        "This theorem establishes existence but not uniqueness.",
        "Indeed we expect that in many cases there will be multiple allocations (and hence equilibria) which satisfy the conditions of Lemmas 2 and 3.",
        "In particular, not all equilibria of a second-price RBR auction will be efficient.",
        "For instance, according to Lemma 2, with two agents and two slots any allocation can arise in a RBR equilibrium because no constraints apply.",
        "Theorems 2 and 3 taken together provide a possible explanation for Yahoo!s switch from first to second pricing.",
        "We saw in Section 3.1 that this does not induce truthfulness from bidders.",
        "With first pricing, there will always be some bidder that feels compelled to adjust his bid.",
        "Second pricing is more convenient because an equilibrium can be reached, and this reduces the cost of bid management. 4.2 Efficiency For a given allocation rule, we call the allocation that would result if the bidders reported their values truthfully the standard allocation.",
        "Hence in the standard RBB allocation bidders are ranked by true values, and in the standard RBR allocation they are ranked by true revenues.",
        "According to Lemmas 2 and 3, a ranking that results from a Nash equilibrium profile can only deviate from the standard allocation by having agents with relatively similar values or revenues switch places.",
        "That is, if ri > rj then with RBR agent j can be ranked higher than i only if the ratio rj/ri is sufficiently large; similarly for RBB.",
        "This suggests that the value of an equilibrium allocation cannot differ too much from the value obtained in the standard allocation, and the following theorems confirms this.",
        "For an allocation σ of slots to agents, we denote its total value by f(σ) = PN i=1 γirσ(i).",
        "We denote by g(σ) = PN i=1 γixσ(i) allocation σs value when assuming all agents have identical relevance, normalized to 1.",
        "Let L = min i=1,...,N−1 min  γi+1 γi , 1 − γi+2 γi+1 ff (where by default γN+1 = 0).",
        "Let ηx and ηr be the standard allocations when using RBB and RBR, respectively.",
        "Theorem 4.",
        "For an allocation σ that results from a purestrategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBR slot auction, we have f(σ) ≥ Lf(ηr).",
        "Proof.",
        "We number the agents so that agent i has the ith highest revenue, so r1 ≥ r2 ≥ . . . ≥ rN .",
        "Hence the standard allocation has value f(ηr) = PN i=1 γiri.",
        "To prove the theorem, we will make repeated use of the fact thatP k akP k bk ≥ mink ak bk when the ak and bk are positive.",
        "Note that according to Lemma 2, if agent i lies at least two slots below slot j, then rσ(j) ≥ ri 1 − γj+2 γj+1 .",
        "It may be the case that for some slot i, we have σ(i) > i and for slots k > i + 1 we have σ(k) > i.",
        "We then say that slot i is inverted.",
        "Let S be the set of agents with indices at least i + 1; there are N − i of these.",
        "If slot i is inverted, it is occupied by some agent from S. Also all slots strictly lower than i + 1 must be occupied by the remaining agents from S, since σ(k) > i for k ≥ i + 2.",
        "The agent in slot i + 1 must then have an index σ(i + 1) ≤ i (note this means slot i + 1 cannot be inverted).",
        "Now there are two cases.",
        "In the first case we have σ(i) = i + 1.",
        "Then γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ γi+1ri + γiri+1 γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ min  γi+1 γi , γi γi+1 ff = γi+1 γi In the second case we have σ(i) > i+1.",
        "Then since all agents in S except the one in slot i lie strictly below slot i + 1, and 225 the agent in slot i is not agent i + 1, it must be that agent i+1 is in a slot strictly below slot i+1.",
        "This means that it is at least two slots below the agent that actually occupies slot i, and by Lemma 2 we then have rσ(i) ≥ ri+1 1 − γi+2 γi+1 .",
        "Thus, γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ γi+1ri + γirσ(i) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ min  γi+1 γi , 1 − γi+2 γi+1 ff If slot i is not inverted, then on one hand we may have σ(i) ≤ i, in which case rσ(i)/ri ≥ 1.",
        "On the other hand we may have σ(i) > i but there is some agent with index j ≤ i that lies at least two slots below slot i.",
        "Then by Lemma 2, rσ(i) ≥ rj 1 − γi+2 γi+1 ≥ ri 1 − γi+2 γi+1 .",
        "We write i ∈ I if slot i is inverted, and i ∈ I if neither i nor i − 1 are inverted.",
        "By our arguments above two consecutive slots cannot be inverted, so we can write f(σ) f(γr) = P i∈I ` γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) ´ + P i∈I γirσ(i) P i∈I (γiri + γi+1ri+1) + P i∈I γiri ≥ min  min i∈I  γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ff , min i∈I  γirσ(i) γiri ffff ≥ L and this completes the proof.",
        "Note that for RBR, the standard value is also the efficient value by Theorem 1.",
        "Also note that for an exponential decay model, L = min ˘1 δ , 1 − 1 δ ¯ .",
        "With δ = 1.428 (see Section 2.1), the factor is L ≈ 1/3.34, so the total value in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBR slot auction is always within a factor of 3.34 of the efficient value with such a discount.",
        "Again for RBB we have an analogous result.",
        "Theorem 5.",
        "For an allocation σ that results from a purestrategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBB slot auction, we have g(σ) ≥ Lg(ηx).",
        "Proof Sketch.",
        "Simply substitute bidder values for bidder revenues in the proof of Theorem 4, and appeal to Lemma 3. 5.",
        "CONCLUSIONS This paper analyzed stylized versions of the slot auction designs currently used by Yahoo! and Google, namely rank by bid (RBB) and rank by revenue (RBR), respectively.",
        "We also considered first and second pricing rules together with each of these allocation rules, since both have been used historically.",
        "We first studied the short-run setting with incomplete information, corresponding to the case where agents have just approached the mechanism.",
        "Our equilibrium analysis revealed that RBB has much weaker informational requirements than RBR, because bidders need not know any information about relevance (even their own) to play the Bayes-Nash equilibrium.",
        "However, RBR leads to an efficient allocation in equilibrium, whereas RBB does not.",
        "We showed that for an arbitrary distribution over value and relevance, no revenue ranking of RBB and RBR is possible.",
        "We hope that the tools we used to establish these results (revenue equivalence, the form of first-price equilibria, the truthful payments rules) will help others wanting to pursue further analyses of slot auctions.",
        "We also studied the long-run case where agents have experimented with their bids and each settled on one they find optimal.",
        "We argued that a stable set of bids in this setting can be modeled as a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of the static game of complete information.",
        "We showed that no pure-strategy equilibrium exists with either RBB or RBR using first pricing, but that with second pricing there always exists such an equilibrium (in the case of RBR, an efficient equilibrium).",
        "In general second pricing allows for multiple pure-strategy equilibria, but we showed that the value of such equilibria diverges by only a constant factor from the value obtained if all agents bid truthfully (which in the case of RBR is the efficient value). 6.",
        "FUTURE WORK Introducing budget constraints into the model is a natural next step for future work.",
        "The complication here lies in the fact that budgets are often set for entire campaigns rather than single keywords.",
        "Assuming that the optimal choice of budget can be made independent of the choice of bid for a specific keyword, it can be shown that it is a dominant-strategy to report this optimal budget with ones bid.",
        "The problem is then to ascertain that bids and budgets can indeed be optimized separately, or to find a plausible model where deriving equilibrium bids and budgets together is tractable.",
        "Identifying a condition on the distribution over value and relevance that actually does yield a revenue ranking of RBB and RBR (such as correlation between value and relevance, perhaps) would yield a more satisfactory characterization of their relative revenue properties.",
        "Placing bounds on the revenue obtained in a complete information equilibrium is also a relevant question.",
        "Because the incomplete information case is such a close generalization of the most basic single-item auction model, it would be interesting to see which standard results from single-item auction theory (e.g. results with risk-averse bidders, an endogenous number of bidders, asymmetries, etc...) automatically generalize and which do not, to fully understand the structural differences between single-item and slot auctions.",

                "We saw in Section 3.1 that this does not induce truthfulness from bidders.",
                "With first pricing, there will always be some bidder that feels compelled to adjust his bid.",
                "Second pricing is more convenient because an equilibrium can be reached, and this reduces the cost of bid management. 4.2 Efficiency For a given allocation rule, we call the allocation that would result if the bidders reported their values truthfully the standard allocation.",
                "Hence in the standard RBB allocation bidders are ranked by true values, and in the standard RBR allocation they are ranked by true revenues.",
                "According to Lemmas 2 and 3, a ranking that results from a Nash equilibrium profile can only deviate from the standard allocation by having agents with relatively similar values or revenues switch places.",
                "That is, if ri > rj then with RBR agent j can be ranked higher than i only if the ratio rj/ri is sufficiently large; similarly for RBB.",

                "The complication here lies in the fact that budgets are often set for entire campaigns rather than single keywords.",
                "Assuming that the optimal choice of budget can be made independent of the choice of bid for a specific keyword, it can be shown that it is a dominant-strategy to report this optimal budget with ones bid.",

                "Identifying a condition on the distribution over value and relevance that actually does yield a revenue ranking of RBB and RBR (such as correlation between value and relevance, perhaps) would yield a more satisfactory characterization of their relative revenue properties.",
                "Placing bounds on the revenue obtained in a complete information equilibrium is also a relevant question.",
                "Because the incomplete information case is such a close generalization of the most basic single-item auction model, it would be interesting to see which standard results from single-item auction theory (e.g. results with risk-averse bidders, an endogenous number of bidders, asymmetries, etc...) automatically generalize and which do not, to fully understand the structural differences between single-item and slot auctions.",

                "Our equilibrium analysis revealed that RBB has much weaker informational requirements than RBR, because bidders need not know any information about relevance (even their own) to play the Bayes-Nash equilibrium.",

                "We argued that a stable set of bids in this setting can be modeled as a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of the static game of complete information.",
                "We showed that no pure-strategy equilibrium exists with either RBB or RBR using first pricing, but that with second pricing there always exists such an equilibrium (in the case of RBR, an efficient equilibrium).",
                "In general second pricing allows for multiple pure-strategy equilibria, but we showed that the value of such equilibria diverges by only a constant factor from the value obtained if all agents bid truthfully (which in the case of RBR is the efficient value). 6.",

                "Assuming that the optimal choice of budget can be made independent of the choice of bid for a specific keyword, it can be shown that it is a dominant-strategy to report this optimal budget with ones bid.",
                "The problem is then to ascertain that bids and budgets can indeed be optimized separately, or to find a plausible model where deriving equilibrium bids and budgets together is tractable.",
                "Identifying a condition on the distribution over value and relevance that actually does yield a revenue ranking of RBB and RBR (such as correlation between value and relevance, perhaps) would yield a more satisfactory characterization of their relative revenue properties.",
                "Placing bounds on the revenue obtained in a complete information equilibrium is also a relevant question.",
                "Because the incomplete information case is such a close generalization of the most basic single-item auction model, it would be interesting to see which standard results from single-item <br>auction theory</br> (e.g. results with risk-averse bidders, an endogenous number of bidders, asymmetries, etc...) automatically generalize and which do not, to fully understand the structural differences between single-item and slot auctions.",
