Todays event correlation mainly addresses the correlation of events as reported from management tools. However, a correlation of user trouble reports concerning services should also be performed. This is necessary to improve the resolution time and to reduce the effort for keeping the service agreements. We refer to such a type of correlation as service-oriented event correlation. The necessity to use this kind of event correlation is motivated in the paper. To introduce service-oriented event correlation for an IT service provider, an appropriate modeling of the correlation workflow and of the information is necessary. Therefore, we examine the process management frameworks IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM) for their contribution to the workflow modeling in this area. The different kinds of dependencies that we find in our general scenario are then used to develop a workflow for the service-oriented event correlation. The MNM Service Model, which is a generic model for IT service management proposed by the Munich Network Management (MNM) Team, is used to derive an appropriate information modeling. An example scenario, the Web Hosting Service of the Leibniz Supercomputing Center (LRZ), is used to demonstrate the application of service-oriented event correlation.

INTRODUCTION In huge networks a single fault can cause a burst of failure events. To handle the flood of events and to find the root cause of a fault, event correlation approaches like rule-based reasoning, case-based reasoning or the codebook approach have been developed. The main idea of correlation is to condense and structure events to retrieve meaningful information. Until now, these approaches address primarily the correlation of events as reported from management tools or devices. Therefore, we call them device-oriented. In this paper we define a service as a set of functions which are offered by a provider to a customer at a customer provider interface. The definition of a service is therefore more general than the definition of a Web Service, but a Web Service is included in this service definition. As a consequence, the results are applicable for Web Services as well as for other kinds of services. A service level agreement (SLA) is defined as a contract between customer and provider about guaranteed service performance. As in todays IT environments the offering of such services with an agreed service quality becomes more and more important, this change also affects the event correlation. It has become a necessity for providers to offer such guarantees for a differentiation from other providers. To avoid SLA violations it is especially important for service providers to identify the root cause of a fault in a very short time or even act proactively. The latter refers to the case of recognizing the influence of a device breakdown on the offered services. As in this scenario the knowledge about services and their SLAs is used we call it service-oriented. It can be addressed from two directions. Top-down perspective: Several customers report a problem in a certain time interval. Are these trouble reports correlated? How to identify a resource as being the problems root cause? 183 Bottom-up perspective: A device (e.g., router, server) breaks down. Which services, and especially which customers, are affected by this fault? The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe how event correlation is performed today and present a selection of the state-of-the-art event correlation techniques. Section 3 describes the motivation for serviceoriented event correlation and its benefits. After having motivated the need for such type of correlation we use two well-known IT service management models to gain requirements for an appropriate workflow modeling and present our proposal for it (see Section 4). In Section 5 we present our information modeling which is derived from the MNM Service Model. An application of the approach for a web hosting scenario is performed in Section 6. The last section concludes the paper and presents future work. 2. TODAYS EVENT CORRELATION TECHNIQUES In [11] the task of event correlation is defined as a conceptual interpretation procedure in the sense that a new meaning is assigned to a set of events that happen in a certain time interval. We can distinguish between three aspects for event correlation. Functional aspect: The correlation focuses on functions which are provided by each network element. It is also regarded which other functions are used to provide a specific function. Topology aspect: The correlation takes into account how the network elements are connected to each other and how they interact. Time aspect: When explicitly regarding time constraints, a start and end time has to be defined for each event. The correlation can use time relationships between the events to perform the correlation. This aspect is only mentioned in some papers [11], but it has to be treated in an event correlation system. In the event correlation it is also important to distinguish between the knowledge acquisition/representation and the correlation algorithm. Examples of approaches to knowledge acquisition/representation are Gruschkes dependency graphs [6] and Ensels dependency detection by neural networks [3]. It is also possible to find the dependencies by analyzing interactions [7]. In addition, there is an approach to manage service dependencies with XML and to define a resource description framework [4]. To get an overview about device-oriented event correlation a selection of several event correlation techniques being used for this kind of correlation is presented. Model-based reasoning: Model-based reasoning (MBR) [15, 10, 20] represents a system by modeling each of its components. A model can either represent a physical entity or a logical entity (e.g., LAN, WAN, domain, service, business process). The models for physical entities are called functional model, while the models for all logical entities are called logical model. A description of each model contains three categories of information: attributes, relations to other models, and behavior. The event correlation is a result of the collaboration among models. As all components of a network are represented with their behavior in the model, it is possible to perform simulations to predict how the whole network will behave. A comparison in [20] showed that a large MBR system is not in all cases easy to maintain. It can be difficult to appropriately model the behavior for all components and their interactions correctly and completely. An example system for MBR is NetExpert[16] from OSI which is a hybrid MBR/RBR system (in 2000 OSI was acquired by Agilent Technologies). Rule-based reasoning: Rule-based reasoning (RBR) [15, 10] uses a set of rules for event correlation. The rules have the form conclusion if condition. The condition uses received events and information about the system, while the conclusion contains actions which can either lead to system changes or use system parameters to choose the next rule. An advantage of the approach is that the rules are more or less human-readable and therefore their effect is intuitive. The correlation has proved to be very fast in practice by using the RETE algorithm. In the literature [20, 1] it is claimed that RBR systems are classified as relatively inflexible. Frequent changes in the modeled IT environment would lead to many rule updates. These changes would have to be performed by experts as no automation has currently been established. In some systems information about the network topology which is needed for the event correlation is not used explicitly, but is encoded into the rules. This intransparent usage would make rule updates for topology changes quite difficult. The system brittleness would also be a problem for RBR systems. It means that the system fails if an unknown case occurs, because the case cannot be mapped onto similar cases. The output of RBR systems would also be difficult to predict, because of unforeseen rule interactions in a large rule set. According to [15] an RBR system is only appropriate if the domain for which it is used is small, nonchanging, and well understood. The GTE IMPACT system [11] is an example of a rulebased system. It also uses MBR (GTE has merged with Bell Atlantic in 1998 and is now called Verizon [19]). Codebook approach: The codebook approach [12, 21] has similarities to RBR, but takes a further step and encodes the rules into a correlation matrix. The approach starts using a dependency graph with two kinds of nodes for the modeling. The first kind of nodes are the faults (denoted as problems in the cited papers) which have to be detected, while the second kind of nodes are observable events (symptoms in the papers) which are caused by the faults or other events. The dependencies between the nodes are denoted as directed edges. It is possible to choose weights for the edges, e.g., a weight for the probability that 184 fault/event A causes event B. Another possible weighting could indicate time dependencies. There are several possibilities to reduce the initial graph. If, e.g., a cyclic dependency of events exists and there are no probabilities for the cycles edges, all events can be treated as one event. After a final input graph is chosen, the graph is transformed into a correlation matrix where the columns contain the faults and the rows contain the events. If there is a dependency in the graph, the weight of the corresponding edge is put into the according matrix cell. In case no weights are used, the matrix cells get the values 1 for dependency and 0 otherwise. Afterwards, a simplification can be done, where events which do not help to discriminate faults are deleted. There is a trade-off between the minimization of the matrix and the robustness of the results. If the matrix is minimized as much as possible, some faults can only be distinguished by a single event. If this event cannot be reliably detected, the event correlation system cannot discriminate between the two faults. A measure how many event observation errors can be compensated by the system is the Hamming distance. The number of rows (events) that can be deleted from the matrix can differ very much depending on the relationships [15]. The codebook approach has the advantage that it uses long-term experience with graphs and coding. This experience is used to minimize the dependency graph and to select an optimal group of events with respect to processing time and robustness against noise. A disadvantage of the approach could be that similar to RBR frequent changes in the environment make it necessary to frequently edit the input graph. SMARTS InCharge [12, 17] is an example of such a correlation system. Case-based reasoning: In contrast to other approaches case-based reasoning (CBR) [14, 15] systems do not use any knowledge about the system structure. The knowledge base saves cases with their values for system parameters and successful recovery actions for these cases. The recovery actions are not performed by the CBR system in the first place, but in most cases by a human operator. If a new case appears, the CBR system compares the current system parameters with the system parameters in prior cases and tries to find a similar one. To identify such a match it has to be defined for which parameters the cases can differ or have to be the same. If a match is found, a learned action can be performed automatically or the operator can be informed with a recovery proposal. An advantage of this approach is that the ability to learn is an integral part of it which is important for rapid changing environments. There are also difficulties when applying the approach [15]. The fields which are used to find a similar case and their importance have to be defined appropriately. If there is a match with a similar case, an adaptation of the previous solution to the current one has to be found. An example system for CBR is SpectroRx from Cabletron Systems. The part of Cabletron that developed SpectroRx became an independent software company in 2002 and is now called Aprisma Management Technologies [2]. In this section four event correlation approaches were presented which have evolved into commercial event correlation systems. The correlation approaches have different focuses. MBR mainly deals with the knowledge acquisition and representation, while RBR and the codebook approach propose a correlation algorithm. The focus of CBR is its ability to learn from prior cases. 3. MOTIVATION OF SERVICE-ORIENTED EVENT CORRELATION Fig. 1 shows a general service scenario upon which we will discuss the importance of a service-oriented correlation. Several services like SSH, a web hosting service, or a video conference service are offered by a provider to its customers at the customer provider interface. A customer can allow several users to use a subscribed service. The quality and cost issues of the subscribed services between a customer and a provider are agreed in SLAs. On the provider side the services use subservices for their provisioning. In case of the services mentioned above such subservices are DNS, proxy service, and IP service. Both services and subservices depend on resources upon which they are provisioned. As displayed in the figure a service can depend on more than one resource and a resource can be used by one or more services. SSH DNS proxy IP service dependency resource dependency user a user b user c customer SLA web a video conf. SSH sun1 provider video conf. web services subservices resources Figure 1: Scenario To get a common understanding, we distinguish between different types of events: Resource event: We use the term resource event for network events and system events. A network event refers to events like node up/down or link up/down whereas system events refer to events like server down or authentication failure. Service event: A service event indicates that a service does not work properly. A trouble ticket which is generated from a customer report is a kind of such an 185 event. Other service events can be generated by the provider of a service, if the provider himself detects a service malfunction. In such a scenario the provider may receive service events from customers which indicate that SSH, web hosting service, and video conference service are not available. When referring to the service hierarchy, the provider can conclude in such a case that all services depend on DNS. Therefore, it seems more likely that a common resource which is necessary for this service does not work properly or is not available than to assume three independent service failures. In contrast to a resource-oriented perspective where all of the service events would have to be processed separately, the service events can be linked together. Their information can be aggregated and processed only once. If, e.g., the problem is solved, one common message to the customers that their services are available again is generated and distributed by using the list of linked service events. This is certainly a simplified example. However, it shows the general principle of identifying the common subservices and common resources of different services. It is important to note that the service-oriented perspective is needed to integrate service aspects, especially QoS aspects. An example of such an aspect is that a fault does not lead to a total failure of a service, but its QoS parameters, respectively agreed service levels, at the customer-provider interface might not be met. A degradation in service quality which is caused by high traffic load on the backbone is another example. In the resource-oriented perspective it would be possible to define events which indicate that there is a link usage higher than a threshold, but no mechanism has currently been established to find out which services are affected and whether a QoS violation occurs. To summarize, the reasons for the necessity of a serviceoriented event correlation are the following: Keeping of SLAs (top-down perspective): The time interval between the first symptom (recognized either by provider, network management tools, or customers) that a service does not perform properly and the verified fault repair needs to be minimized. This is especially needed with respect to SLAs as such agreements often contain guarantees like a mean time to repair. Effort reduction (top-down perspective): If several user trouble reports are symptoms of the same fault, fault processing should be performed only once and not several times. If the fault has been repaired, the affected customers should be informed about this automatically. Impact analysis (bottom-up perspective): In case of a fault in a resource, its influence on the associated services and affected customers can be determined. This analysis can be performed for short term (when there is currently a resource failure) or long term (e.g., network optimization) considerations. 4. WORKFLOW MODELING In the following we examine the established IT process management frameworks IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM). The aim is find out where event correlation can be found in the process structure and how detailed the frameworks currently are. After that we present our solution for a workflow modeling for the service-oriented event correlation. 4.1 IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) The British Office of Government Commerce (OGC) and the IT Service Management Forum (itSMF) [9] provide a collection of best practices for IT processes in the area of IT service management which is called ITIL. The service management is described by 11 modules which are grouped into Service Support Set (provider internal processes) and Service Delivery Set (processes at the customer-provider interface). Each module describes processes, functions, roles, and responsibilities as well as necessary databases and interfaces. In general, ITIL describes contents, processes, and aims at a high abstraction level and contains no information about management architectures and tools. The fault management is divided into Incident Management process and Problem Management process. Incident Management: The Incident Management contains the service desk as interface to customers (e.g., receives reports about service problems). In case of severe errors structured queries are transferred to the Problem Management. Problem Management: The Problem Managements tasks are to solve problems, take care of keeping priorities, minimize the reoccurrence of problems, and to provide management information. After receiving requests from the Incident Management, the problem has to be identified and information about necessary countermeasures is transferred to the Change Management. The ITIL processes describe only what has to be done, but contain no information how this can be actually performed. As a consequence, event correlation is not part of the modeling. The ITIL incidents could be regarded as input for the service-oriented event correlation, while the output could be used as a query to the ITIL Problem Management. 4.2 Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM) The TeleManagement Forum (TMF) [18] is an international non-profit organization from service providers and suppliers in the area of telecommunications services. Similar to ITIL a process-oriented framework has been developed at first, but the framework was designed for a narrower focus, i.e., the market of information and communications service providers. A horizontal grouping into processes for customer care, service development & operations, network & systems management, and partner/supplier is performed. The vertical grouping (fulfillment, assurance, billing) reflects the service life cycle. In the area of fault management three processes have been defined along the horizontal process grouping. Problem Handling: The purpose of this process is to receive trouble reports from customers and to solve them by using the Service Problem Management. The aim is also to keep the customer informed about the current status of the trouble report processing as well as about the general network status (e.g., planned maintenance). It is also a task of this process to inform the 186 QoS/SLA management about the impact of current errors on the SLAs. Service Problem Management: In this process reports about customer-affecting service failures are received and transformed. Their root causes are identified and a problem solution or a temporary workaround is established. The task of the Diagnose Problem subprocess is to find the root cause of the problem by performing appropriate tests. Nothing is said how this can be done (e.g., no event correlation is mentioned). Resource Trouble Management: A subprocess of the Resource Trouble Management is responsible for resource failure event analysis, alarm correlation & filtering, and failure event detection & reporting. Another subprocess is used to execute different tests to find a resource failure. There is also another subprocess which keeps track about the status of the trouble report processing. This subprocess is similar to the functionality of a trouble ticket system. The process description in eTOM is not very detailed. It is useful to have a check list which aspects for these processes have to be taken into account, but there is no detailed modeling of the relationships and no methodology for applying the framework. Event correlation is only mentioned in the resource management, but it is not used in the service level. 4.3 Workflow Modeling for the Service-Oriented Event Correlation Fig. 2 shows a general service scenario which we will use as basis for the workflow modeling for the service-oriented event correlation. We assume that the dependencies are already known (e.g., by using the approaches mentioned in Section 2). The provider offers different services which depend on other services called subservices (service dependency). Another kind of dependency exists between services/subservices and resources. These dependencies are called resource dependencies. These two kinds of dependencies are in most cases not used for the event correlation performed today. This resource-oriented event correlation deals only with relationships on the resource level (e.g., network topology). service dependency resources subservices provider services resource dependency Figure 2: Different kinds of dependencies for the service-oriented event correlation The dependencies depicted in Figure 2 reflect a situation with no redundancy in the service provisioning. The relationships can be seen as AND relationships. In case of redundancy, if e.g., a provider has 3 independent web servers, another modeling (see Figure 3) should be used (OR relationship). In such a case different relationships are possible. The service could be seen as working properly if one of the servers is working or a certain percentage of them is working. services ) AND relationship b) OR relationship resources Figure 3: Modeling of no redundancy (a) and of redundancy (b) As both ITIL and eTOM contain no description how event correlation and especially service-oriented event correlation should actually be performed, we propose the following design for such a workflow (see Fig. 4). The additional components which are not part of a device-oriented event correlation are depicted with a gray background. The workflow is divided into the phases fault detection, fault diagnosis, and fault recovery. In the fault detection phase resource events and service events can be generated from different sources. The resource events are issued during the use of a resource, e.g., via SNMP traps. The service events are originated from customer trouble reports, which are reported via the Customer Service Management (see below) access point. In addition to these two passive ways to get the events, a provider can also perform active tests. These tests can either deal with the resources (resource active probing) or can assume the role of a virtual customer and test a service or one of its subservices by performing interactions at the service access points (service active probing). The fault diagnosis phase is composed of three event correlation steps. The first one is performed by the resource event correlator which can be regarded as the event correlator in todays commercial systems. Therefore, it deals only with resource events. The service event correlator does a correlation of the service events, while the aggregate event correlator finally performs a correlation of both resource and service events. If the correlation result in one of the correlation steps shall be improved, it is possible to go back to the fault detection phase and start the active probing to get additional events. These events can be helpful to confirm a correlation result or to reduce the list of possible root causes. After the event correlation an ordered list of possible root causes is checked by the resource management. When the root cause is found, the failure repair starts. This last step is performed in the fault recovery phase. The next subsections present different elements of the event correlation process. 4.4 Customer Service Management and Intelligent Assistant The Customer Service Management (CSM) access point was proposed by [13] as a single interface between customer 187 fault detection fault diagnosis resource active probing resource event resource event correlator resource management candidate list fault recovery resource usage service active probing intelligent assistant service event correlator aggregate event correlator service eventCSM AP Figure 4: Event correlation workflow and provider. Its functionality is to provide information to the customer about his subscribed services, e.g., reports about the fulfillment of agreed SLAs. It can also be used to subscribe services or to allow the customer to manage his services in a restricted way. Reports about problems with a service can be sent to the customer via CSM. The CSM is also contained in the MNM Service Model (see Section 5). To reduce the effort for the providers first level support, an Intelligent Assistant can be added to the CSM. The Intelligent Assistant structures the customers information about a service problem. The information which is needed for a preclassification of the problem is gathered from a list of questions to the customer. The list is not static as the current question depends on the answers to prior questions or from the result of specific tests. A decision tree is used to structure the questions and tests. The tests allow the customer to gain a controlled access to the providers management. At the LRZ a customer of the E-Mail Service can, e.g., use the Intelligent Assistant to perform ping requests to the mail server. But also more complex requests could be possible, e.g., requests of a combination of SNMP variables. 4.5 Active Probing Active probing is useful for the provider to check his offered services. The aim is to identify and react to problems before a customer notices them. The probing can be done from a customer point of view or by testing the resources which are part of the services. It can also be useful to perform tests of subservices (own subservices or subservices offered by suppliers). Different schedules are possible to perform the active probing. The provider could select to test important services and resources in regular time intervals. Other tests could be initiated by a user who traverses the decision tree of the Intelligent Assistant including active tests. Another possibility for the use of active probing is a request from the event correlator, if the current correlation result needs to be improved. The results of active probing are reported via service or resource events to the event correlator (or if the test was demanded by the Intelligent Assistant the result is reported to it, too). While the events that are received from management tools and customers denote negative events (something does not work), the events from active probing should also contain positive events for a better discrimination. 4.6 Event Correlator The event correlation should not be performed by a single event correlator, but by using different steps. The reason for this are the different characteristics of the dependencies (see Fig. 1). On the resource level there are only relationships between resources (network topology, systems configuration). An example for this could be a switch linking separate LANs. If the switch is down, events are reported that other network components which are located behind the switch are also not reachable. When correlating these events it can be figured out that the switch is the likely error cause. At this stage, the integration of service events does not seem to be helpful. The result of this step is a list of resources which could be the problems root cause. The resource event correlator is used to perform this step. In the service-oriented scenario there are also service and resource dependencies. As next step in the event correlation process the service events should be correlated with each other using the service dependencies, because the service dependencies have no direct relationship to the resource level. The result of this step, which is performed by the service event correlator, is a list of services/subservices which could contain a failure in a resource. If, e.g., there are service events from customers that two services do not work and both services depend on a common subservice, it seems more likely that the resource failure can be found inside the subservice. The output of this correlation is a list of services/subservices which could be affected by a failure in an associated resource. In the last step the aggregate event correlator matches the lists from resource event correlator and service event correlator to find the problems possible root cause. This is done by using the resource dependencies. The event correlation techniques presented in Section 2 could be used to perform the correlation inside the three event correlators. If the dependencies can be found precisely, an RBR or codebook approach seems to be appropriate. A case database (CBR) could be used if there are cases which could not be covered by RBR or the codebook approach. These cases could then be used to improve the modeling in a way that RBR or the codebook approach can deal with them in future correlations. 5. INFORMATION MODELING In this section we use a generic model for IT service management to derive the information necessary for the event correlation process. 5.1 MNM Service Model The MNM Service Model [5] is a generic model for IT service management. A distinction is made between customer side and provider side. The customer side contains the basic roles customer and user, while the provider side contains the role provider. The provider makes the service available to the customer side. The service as a whole is divided into usage which is accessed by the role user and management which is used by the role customer. The model consists of two main views. The Service View (see Fig. 5) shows a common perspective of the service for customer and provider. Everything that is only important 188 for the service realization is not contained in this view. For these details another perspective, the Realization View, is defined (see Fig. 6). customer domain supplies supplies provider domain «role» provider accesses uses concludes accesses implements observesrealizes provides directs substantiates usesuses manages implementsrealizes manages service concludes QoS parameters usage functionality service access point management functionality service implementation service management implementation service agreement customersideprovidersidesideindependent «role» user «role» customer CSM access point service client CSM client Figure 5: Service View The Service View contains the service for which the functionality is defined for usage as well as for management. There are two access points (service access point and CSM access point) where user and customer can access the usage and management functionality, respectively. Associated to each service is a list of QoS parameters which have to be met by the service at the service access point. The QoS surveillance is performed by the management. provider domain implements observesrealizes provides directs implementsrealizes accesses uses concludes accesses usesuses manages side independent side independent manages manages concludes acts as service implementation service management implementation manages uses acts as service logic sub-service client service client CSM client uses resources usesuses service management logic sub-service management client basic management functionality «role» customer «role» provider «role» user Figure 6: Realization View In the Realization View the service implementation and the service management implementation are described in detail. For both there are provider-internal resources and subservices. For the service implementation a service logic uses internal resources (devices, knowledge, staff) and external subservices to provide the service. Analogous, the service management implementation includes a service management logic using basic management functionalities [8] and external management subservices. The MNM Service Model can be used for a similar modeling of the used subservices, i.e., the model can be applied recursively. As the service-oriented event correlation has to use dependencies of a service from subservices and resources, the model is used in the following to derive the needed information for service events. 5.2 Information Modeling for Service Events Todays event correlation deals mainly with events which are originated from resources. Beside a resource identifier these events contain information about the resource status, e.g., SNMP variables. To perform a service-oriented event correlation it is necessary to define events which are related to services. These events can be generated from the providers own service surveillance or from customer reports at the CSM interface. They contain information about the problems with the agreed QoS. In our information modeling we define an event superclass which contains common attributes (e.g., time stamp). Resource event and service event inherit from this superclass. Derived from the MNM Service Model we define the information necessary for a service event. Service: As a service event shall represent the problems of a single service, a unique identification of the affected service is contained here. Event description: This field has to contain a description of the problem. Depending on the interactions at the service access point (Service View) a classification of the problem into different categories should be defined. It should also be possible to add an informal description of the problem. QoS parameters: For each service QoS parameters (Service View) are defined between the provider and the customer. This field represents a list of these QoS parameters and agreed service levels. The list can help the provider to set the priority of a problem with respect to the service levels agreed. Resource list: This list contains the resources (Realization View) which are needed to provide the service. This list is used by the provider to check if one of these resources causes the problem. Subservice service event identification: In the service hierarchy (Realization View) the service, for which this service event has been issued, may depend on subservices. If there is a suspicion that one of these subservices causes the problem, child service events are issued from this service event for the subservices. In such a case this field contains links to the corresponding events. Other event identifications: In the event correlation process the service event can be correlated with other service events or with resource events. This field then contains links to other events which have been correlated to this service event. This is useful to, e.g., send a common message to all affected customers when their subscribed services are available again. Issuers identification: This field can either contain an identification of the customer who reported the problem, an identification of a service providers employee 189 (in case the failure has been detected by the providers own service active probing) or a link to a parent service event. The identification is needed, if there are ambiguities in the service event or the issuer should be informed (e.g., that the service is available again). The possible issuers refer to the basic roles (customer, provider) in the Service Model. Assignee: To keep track of the processing the name and address of the providers employee who is solving or solved the problem is also noted. This is a specialization of the provider role in the Service Model. Dates: This field contains key dates in the processing of the service event such as initial date, problem identification date, resolution date. These dates are important to keep track how quick the problems have been solved. Status: This field represents the service events actual status (e.g., active, suspended, solved). Priority: The priority shows which importance the service event has from the providers perspective. The importance is derived from the service agreement, especially the agreed QoS parameters (Service View). The fields date, status, and other service events are not derived directly from the Service Model, but are necessary for the event correlation process. 6. APPLICATION OF SERVICE-ORIENTED EVENT CORRELATION FOR A WEB HOSTING SCENARIO The Leibniz Supercomputing Center is the joint computing center for the Munich universities and research institutions. It also runs the Munich Scientific Network and offers related services. One of these services is the Virtual WWW Server, a web hosting offer for smaller research institutions. It currently has approximately 200 customers. A subservice of the Virtual WWW Server is the Storage Service which stores the static and dynamic web pages and uses caching techniques for a fast access. Other subservices are DNS and IP service. When a user accesses a hosted web site via one of the LRZs Virtual Private Networks the VPN service is also used. The resources of the Virtual WWW Server include a load balancer and 5 redundant servers. The network connections are also part of the resources as well as the Apache web server application running on the servers. Figure 7 shows the dependencies of the Virtual WWW Server. 6.1 Customer Service Management and Intelligent Assistant The Intelligent Assistant that is available at the Leibniz Supercomputing Center can currently be used for connectivity or performance problems or problems with the LRZ E-Mail Service. A selection of possible customer problem reports for the Virtual WWW Server is given in the following: • The hosted web site is not reachable. • The web site access is (too) slow. • The web site contains outdated content. server serverserver server server server server server server outgoing connection hosting of LRZs own pages content caching server emergency server webmail server dynamic web pages static web pages DNS ProxyIP Storage Resources: Services: Virtual WWW Server five redundant servers AFS NFS DBload balancer Figure 7: Dependencies of the Virtual WWW Server • The transfer of new content to the LRZ does not change the provided content. • The web site looks strange (e.g., caused by problems with HTML version) This customer reports have to be mapped onto failures in resources. For, e.g., an unreachable web site different root causes are possible like a DNS problem, connectivity problem, wrong configuration of the load balancer. 6.2 Active Probing In general, active probing can be used for services or resources. For the service active probing of the Virtual WWW Server a virtual customer could be installed. This customer does typical HTTP requests of web sites and compares the answer with the known content. To check the up-to-dateness of a test web site, the content could contain a time stamp. The service active probing could also include the testing of subservices, e.g., sending requests to the DNS. The resource active probing performs tests of the resources. Examples are connectivity tests, requests to application processes, and tests of available disk space. 6.3 Event Correlation for the Virtual WWW Server Figure 8 shows the example processing. At first, a customer who takes a look at his hosted web site reports that the content that he had changed is not displayed correctly. This report is transferred to the service management via the CSM interface. An Intelligent Assistant could be used to structure the customer report. The service management translates the customer report into a service event. Independent from the customer report the service providers own service active probing tries to change the content of a test web site. Because this is not possible, a service event is issued. Meanwhile, a resource event has been reported to the event correlator, because an access of the content caching server to one of the WWW servers failed. As there are no other events at the moment the resource event correlation 190 customer CSM service mgmt event correlator resource mgmt customer reports: web site content not up−to−date service active probing reports: web site content change not possible event: retrieval of server content failedevent forward resource event correlation service event correlation aggregate event correlation link failure report event forward check WWW server check link result display link repair result display result forward customer report Figure 8: Example processing of a customer report cannot correlate this event to other events. At this stage it would be possible that the event correlator asks the resource management to perform an active probing of related resources. Both service events are now transferred to the service event correlator and are correlated. From the correlation of these events it seems likely that either the WWW server itself or the link to the WWW server is the problems root cause. A wrong web site update procedure inside the content caching server seems to be less likely as this would only explain the customer report and not the service active probing result. At this stage a service active probing could be started, but this does not seem to be useful as this correlation only deals with the Web Hosting Service and its resources and not with other services. After the separate correlation of both resource and service events, which can be performed in parallel, the aggregate event correlator is used to correlate both types of events. The additional resource event makes it seem much more likely that the problems are caused by a broken link to the WWW server or by the WWW server itself and not by the content caching server. In this case the event correlator asks the resource management to check the link and the WWW server. The decision between these two likely error causes can not be further automated here. Later, the resource management finds out that a broken link is the failures root cause. It informs the event correlator about this and it can be determined that this explains all previous events. Therefore, the event correlation can be stopped at this point. Depending on the providers customer relationship management the finding of the root cause and an expected repair time could be reported to the customers. After the link has been repaired, it is possible to report this event via the CSM interface. Even though many details of this event correlation process could also be performed differently, the example showed an important advantage of the service-oriented event correlation. The relationship between the service provisioning and the providers resources is explicitly modeled. This allows a mapping of the customer report onto the provider-internal resources. 6.4 Event Correlation for Different Services If a provider like the LRZ offers several services the serviceoriented event correlation can be used to reveal relationships that are not obvious in the first place. If the LRZ E-Mail Service and its events are viewed in relationship with the events for the Virtual WWW Server, it is possible to identify failures in common subservices and resources. Both services depend on the DNS which means that customer reports like I cannot retrieve new e-mail and The web site of my research institute is not available can have a common cause, e.g., the DNS does not work properly. 7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In our paper we showed the need for a service-oriented event correlation. For an IT service provider this new kind of event correlation makes it possible to automatically map problems with the current service quality onto resource failures. This helps to find the failures root cause earlier and to reduce costs for SLA violations. In addition, customer reports can be linked together and therefore the processing effort can be reduced. To receive these benefits we presented our approach for performing the service-oriented event correlation as well as a modeling of the necessary correlation information. In the future we are going to apply our workflow and information modeling for services offered by the Leibniz Supercomputing Center going further into details. Several issues have not been treated in detail so far, e.g., the consequences for the service-oriented event correlation if a subservice is offered by another provider. If a service does not perform properly, it has to be determined whether this is caused by the provider himself or by the subservice. In the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the CSM interface. Another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay. Another important point is the precise definition of dependency which has also been left out by many other publications. To avoid having to much dependencies in a certain situation one could try to check whether the dependencies currently exist. In case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the DNS subservice at the beginning, but after the address is resolved a download failure is unlikely to have been caused by the DNS. Another possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service into its possible user interactions (e.g., an e-mail service into transactions like get mail, sent mail, etc) and to define the dependencies for each user interaction.

La correlación del evento actual aborda principalmente la correlación de los eventos como se informa de las herramientas de gestión. Sin embargo, también se debe realizar una correlación de los informes de problemas del usuario sobre los servicios. Esto es necesario para mejorar el tiempo de resolución y reducir el esfuerzo para mantener los acuerdos de servicio. Nos referimos a un tipo de correlación como correlación de eventos orientados al servicio. La necesidad de usar este tipo de correlación de eventos está motivada en el documento. Para introducir la correlación de eventos orientada al servicio para un proveedor de servicios de TI, es necesario un modelado apropiado del flujo de trabajo de correlación y de la información. Por lo tanto, examinamos la Biblioteca de infraestructura de TI de la gestión de procesos (ITIL) y el mapa mejorado de operaciones de telecomunicaciones (ETOM) para su contribución al modelado de flujo de trabajo en esta área. Los diferentes tipos de dependencias que encontramos en nuestro escenario general se utilizan para desarrollar un flujo de trabajo para la correlación de eventos orientados al servicio. El modelo de servicio MNM, que es un modelo genérico para la gestión de servicios de TI propuesto por el equipo de Munich Network Management (MNM), se utiliza para obtener un modelado de información apropiado. Un escenario de ejemplo, el servicio de alojamiento web del Centro de Supercomputación Leibniz (LRZ), se utiliza para demostrar la aplicación de la correlación de eventos orientados a los servicios. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos c.2.4 [Organización de sistemas informáticos]: aplicaciones distribuidas de redes de ComputerMunications Gestión de términos generales, rendimiento, confiabilidad 1. Introducción En las redes enormes, una sola falla puede causar una explosión de eventos de falla. Para manejar la inundación de eventos y encontrar la causa raíz de una falla, se han desarrollado enfoques de correlación de eventos como el razonamiento basado en reglas, el razonamiento basado en casos o el enfoque del libro de códigos. La idea principal de correlación es condensar y estructurar eventos para recuperar información significativa. Hasta ahora, estos enfoques abordan principalmente la correlación de los eventos como se informa en herramientas o dispositivos de gestión. Por lo tanto, los llamamos orientados al dispositivo. En este documento, definimos un servicio como un conjunto de funciones que ofrece un proveedor a un cliente en una interfaz de proveedor de clientes. Por lo tanto, la definición de un servicio es más general que la definición de un servicio web, pero se incluye un servicio web en esta definición de servicio. Como consecuencia, los resultados son aplicables para los servicios web, así como para otros tipos de servicios. Un acuerdo de nivel de servicio (SLA) se define como un contrato entre el cliente y el proveedor sobre el rendimiento del servicio garantizado. Como en los entornos de hoy, la oferta de dichos servicios con una calidad de servicio acordada se vuelve cada vez más importante, este cambio también afecta la correlación del evento. Se ha convertido en una necesidad para que los proveedores ofrezcan tales garantías para una diferenciación de otros proveedores. Para evitar violaciones de SLA, es especialmente importante que los proveedores de servicios identifiquen la causa raíz de una falla en muy poco tiempo o incluso actúen de manera proactiva. Este último se refiere al caso de reconocer la influencia de un desglose del dispositivo en los servicios ofrecidos. Como en este escenario, el conocimiento sobre los servicios y sus SLA se usan, lo llamamos orientado al servicio. Se puede abordar desde dos direcciones. Perspectiva de arriba hacia abajo: varios clientes informan un problema en un cierto intervalo de tiempo. ¿Están correlacionados estos informes de problemas? ¿Cómo identificar un recurso como la causa raíz de problemas?183 Perspectiva ascendente: un dispositivo (por ejemplo, enrutador, servidor) se descompone. ¿Qué servicios, y especialmente qué clientes, se ven afectados por esta culpa? El resto del documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 describimos cómo se realiza la correlación de eventos hoy y presentamos una selección de las técnicas de correlación de eventos de última generación. La Sección 3 describe la motivación para la correlación de eventos orientados al servicio y sus beneficios. Después de haber motivado la necesidad de dicho tipo de correlación, utilizamos dos modelos de gestión de servicios de TI conocidos para obtener requisitos para un modelado de flujo de trabajo apropiado y presentar nuestra propuesta para TI (ver Sección 4). En la Sección 5 presentamos nuestro modelado de información que se deriva del modelo de servicio MNM. Una aplicación del enfoque para un escenario de alojamiento web se realiza en la Sección 6. La última sección concluye el documento y presenta el trabajo futuro.2. Técnicas de correlación de eventos de hoy en [11] La tarea de correlación del evento se define como un procedimiento de interpretación conceptual en el sentido de que se asigna un nuevo significado a un conjunto de eventos que ocurren en un cierto intervalo de tiempo. Podemos distinguir entre tres aspectos para la correlación de eventos. Aspecto funcional: la correlación se centra en las funciones que proporcionan cada elemento de red. También se considera qué otras funciones se utilizan para proporcionar una función específica. Aspecto de topología: la correlación tiene en cuenta cómo se conectan los elementos de la red entre sí y cómo interactúan. Aspecto del tiempo: cuando explícitamente con respecto a las limitaciones de tiempo, se debe definir un tiempo de inicio y finalización para cada evento. La correlación puede usar relaciones de tiempo entre los eventos para realizar la correlación. Este aspecto solo se menciona en algunos documentos [11], pero debe tratarse en un sistema de correlación de eventos. En la correlación del evento, también es importante distinguir entre la adquisición/representación del conocimiento y el algoritmo de correlación. Ejemplos de enfoques para la adquisición/representación del conocimiento son los gráficos de dependencia de Gruschkes [6] y Ensels Detection Detection por redes neuronales [3]. También es posible encontrar las dependencias analizando las interacciones [7]. Además, existe un enfoque para administrar las dependencias de servicios con XML y definir un marco de descripción de recursos [4]. Para obtener una descripción general sobre la correlación de eventos orientados al dispositivo, se presenta una selección de varias técnicas de correlación de eventos para este tipo de correlación. Razonamiento basado en modelos: razonamiento basado en modelos (MBR) [15, 10, 20] representa un sistema modelando cada uno de sus componentes. Un modelo puede representar una entidad física o una entidad lógica (por ejemplo, LAN, WAN, dominio, servicio, proceso comercial). Los modelos para entidades físicas se denominan modelo funcional, mientras que los modelos para todas las entidades lógicas se denominan modelo lógico. Una descripción de cada modelo contiene tres categorías de información: atributos, relaciones con otros modelos y comportamiento. La correlación del evento es el resultado de la colaboración entre los modelos. Como todos los componentes de una red están representados con su comportamiento en el modelo, es posible realizar simulaciones para predecir cómo se comportará toda la red. Una comparación en [20] mostró que un sistema MBR grande no es en todos los casos fácil de mantener. Puede ser difícil modelar adecuadamente el comportamiento para todos los componentes y sus interacciones de manera correcta y completamente. Un sistema de ejemplo para MBR es NetExpert [16] de OSI, que es un sistema HBR/RBR híbrido (en 2000 OSI fue adquirido por Agilent Technologies). Razonamiento basado en reglas: razonamiento basado en reglas (RBR) [15, 10] utiliza un conjunto de reglas para la correlación de eventos. Las reglas tienen la conclusión de la forma si la condición. La condición utiliza eventos e información recibidos sobre el sistema, mientras que la conclusión contiene acciones que pueden conducir a cambios en el sistema o usar parámetros del sistema para elegir la siguiente regla. Una ventaja del enfoque es que las reglas son más o menos legibles por humanos y, por lo tanto, su efecto es intuitivo. La correlación ha demostrado ser muy rápida en la práctica mediante el uso del algoritmo REE. En la literatura [20, 1] se afirma que los sistemas RBR se clasifican como relativamente inflexibles. Los cambios frecuentes en el entorno de TI modelado conducirían a muchas actualizaciones de reglas. Estos cambios tendrían que ser realizados por expertos, ya que actualmente no se ha establecido automatización. En algunos sistemas, la información sobre la topología de la red que se necesita para la correlación del evento no se usa explícitamente, sino que se codifica en las reglas. Este uso intransparente dificultaría las actualizaciones de reglas para los cambios de topología. La fragilidad del sistema también sería un problema para los sistemas RBR. Significa que el sistema falla si se produce un caso desconocido, porque el caso no se puede asignar en casos similares. La salida de los sistemas RBR también sería difícil de predecir, debido a las interacciones de reglas imprevistas en un gran conjunto de reglas. Según [15], un sistema RBR solo es apropiado si el dominio para el cual se usa es pequeño, sin cambios y bien entendido. El sistema de impacto GTE [11] es un ejemplo de un sistema basado en reglas. También usa MBR (GTE se ha fusionado con Bell Atlantic en 1998 y ahora se llama Verizon [19]). Enfoque del libro de códigos: el enfoque del libro de códigos [12, 21] tiene similitudes con RBR, pero da un paso más y codifica las reglas en una matriz de correlación. El enfoque comienza a usar un gráfico de dependencia con dos tipos de nodos para el modelado. El primer tipo de nodos son las fallas (denotadas como problemas en los documentos citados) que deben detectarse, mientras que el segundo tipo de nodos son eventos observables (síntomas en los documentos) causados por las fallas u otros eventos. Las dependencias entre los nodos se denotan como bordes dirigidos. Es posible elegir pesos para los bordes, por ejemplo, un peso para la probabilidad de que 184 fallas/evento A cause el evento B. Otra posible ponderación podría indicar dependencias de tiempo. Hay varias posibilidades para reducir el gráfico inicial. Si, por ejemplo, existe una dependencia cíclica de los eventos y no hay probabilidades para los bordes de los ciclos, todos los eventos pueden tratarse como un solo evento. Después de elegir un gráfico de entrada final, el gráfico se transforma en una matriz de correlación donde las columnas contienen las fallas y las filas contienen los eventos. Si hay una dependencia en el gráfico, el peso del borde correspondiente se coloca en la celda de la matriz. En caso de que no se usen pesos, las células de la matriz obtienen los valores 1 para dependencia y 0 de lo contrario. Posteriormente, se puede hacer una simplificación, donde se eliminan los eventos que no ayudan a discriminar fallas. Existe una compensación entre la minimización de la matriz y la robustez de los resultados. Si la matriz se minimiza tanto como sea posible, algunas fallas solo pueden distinguirse mediante un solo evento. Si este evento no se puede detectar de manera confiable, el sistema de correlación del evento no puede discriminar entre las dos fallas. Una medida de cuántos errores de observación de eventos pueden ser compensados por el sistema es la distancia de hamming. El número de filas (eventos) que se pueden eliminar de la matriz pueden diferir mucho dependiendo de las relaciones [15]. El enfoque del libro de códigos tiene la ventaja de que utiliza experiencia a largo plazo con gráficos y codificación. Esta experiencia se utiliza para minimizar el gráfico de dependencia y para seleccionar un grupo óptimo de eventos con respecto al tiempo de procesamiento y la robustez contra el ruido. Una desventaja del enfoque podría ser tan similar a los cambios frecuentes de RBR en el entorno hacen que sea necesario editar con frecuencia el gráfico de entrada. Smarts Incharge [12, 17] es un ejemplo de tal sistema de correlación. Razonamiento basado en casos: en contraste con otros enfoques, los sistemas de razonamiento basado en casos (CBR) [14, 15] no utilizan ningún conocimiento sobre la estructura del sistema. La base de conocimiento guarda casos con sus valores para los parámetros del sistema y acciones de recuperación exitosas para estos casos. Las acciones de recuperación no son realizadas por el sistema CBR en primer lugar, sino en la mayoría de los casos por un operador humano. Si aparece un nuevo caso, el sistema CBR compara los parámetros del sistema actual con los parámetros del sistema en casos anteriores e intenta encontrar uno similar. Para identificar dicha coincidencia, debe definirse para qué parámetros los casos pueden diferir o tienen que ser los mismos. Si se encuentra una coincidencia, una acción aprendida se puede realizar automáticamente o el operador puede informarse con una propuesta de recuperación. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que la capacidad de aprender es una parte integral que es importante para entornos de rápido cambio. También hay dificultades al aplicar el enfoque [15]. Los campos que se utilizan para encontrar un caso similar y su importancia deben definirse adecuadamente. Si hay una coincidencia con un caso similar, se debe encontrar una adaptación de la solución anterior a la actual. Un sistema de ejemplo para CBR es SpectorX de los sistemas Cabletron. La parte de Cabletron que desarrolló Spectorx se convirtió en una compañía de software independiente en 2002 y ahora se llama Aprisma Management Technologies [2]. En esta sección, se presentaron enfoques de correlación de eventos que se han convertido en sistemas de correlación de eventos comerciales. Los enfoques de correlación tienen diferentes enfoques. MBR trata principalmente de la adquisición y representación del conocimiento, mientras que RBR y el enfoque del libro de códigos proponen un algoritmo de correlación. El enfoque de CBR es su capacidad para aprender de casos anteriores.3. La motivación de la correlación del evento orientada al servicio La Fig. 1 muestra un escenario de servicio general sobre el cual discutiremos la importancia de una correlación orientada al servicio. Un proveedor de sus clientes ofrece varios servicios como SSH, un servicio de alojamiento web o un servicio de videoconferencia a sus clientes en la interfaz de proveedores de clientes. Un cliente puede permitir que varios usuarios usen un servicio suscrito. Los problemas de calidad y costo de los servicios suscritos entre un cliente y un proveedor están acordados en SLA. Por el lado del proveedor, los servicios usan subservicios para su aprovisionamiento. En el caso de los servicios mencionados anteriormente, tales subservicios son DNS, servicio proxy y servicio IP. Tanto los servicios como los subservicios dependen de los recursos de los cuales son aprovisionados. Como se muestra en la figura, un servicio puede depender de más de un recurso y un recurso puede ser utilizado por uno o más servicios. SSH DNS Proxy IP Servicio Dependencia de dependencia de recursos Usuario A Usuario B Usuario C Cliente SLA Web A Video Conf. SSH SUN1 VIDEO DE VIDEO CONF.Recursos de subservicios de servicios web Figura 1: Escenario Para obtener una comprensión común, distinguimos entre diferentes tipos de eventos: Evento de recursos: utilizamos el término evento de recursos para eventos de red y eventos del sistema. Un evento de red se refiere a eventos como Node Up/Down o Link Up/Down, mientras que los eventos del sistema se refieren a eventos como el fallo de la autenticación del servidor o la autenticación. Evento de servicio: un evento de servicio indica que un servicio no funciona correctamente. Un boleto de problema que se genera a partir de un informe del cliente es una especie de evento de este tipo 185. El proveedor de un servicio puede generar otros eventos de servicio, si el propio proveedor detecta un mal funcionamiento del servicio. En tal escenario, el proveedor puede recibir eventos de servicio de clientes que indican que SSH, el servicio de alojamiento web y el servicio de videoconferencia no están disponibles. Al referirse a la jerarquía de servicio, el proveedor puede concluir en tal caso que todos los servicios dependen de DNS. Por lo tanto, parece más probable que un recurso común que sea necesario para este servicio no funcione correctamente o no esté disponible que asumir tres fallas de servicio independientes. A diferencia de una perspectiva orientada a los recursos, donde todos los eventos de servicio tendrían que procesarse por separado, los eventos de servicio se pueden vincular juntos. Su información puede agregarse y procesarse solo una vez. Si, por ejemplo, el problema se resuelve, un mensaje común para los clientes de que sus servicios están disponibles nuevamente se genera y se distribuye utilizando la lista de eventos de servicio vinculados. Este es ciertamente un ejemplo simplificado. Sin embargo, muestra el principio general de identificar los subordenes comunes y los recursos comunes de diferentes servicios. Es importante tener en cuenta que la perspectiva orientada al servicio es necesaria para integrar aspectos de servicio, especialmente los aspectos de QoS. Un ejemplo de tal aspecto es que una falla no conduce a una falla total de un servicio, pero sus parámetros de QoS, respectivamente, los niveles de servicio acordados, en la interfaz del proveedor del cliente podrían no cumplirse. Una degradación en la calidad del servicio causada por una alta carga de tráfico en la red troncal es otro ejemplo. En la perspectiva orientada a los recursos, sería posible definir eventos que indiquen que hay un uso de enlace superior a un umbral, pero actualmente no se ha establecido un mecanismo para averiguar qué servicios se ven afectados y si ocurre una violación de QoS. Para resumir, las razones de la necesidad de una correlación de eventos orientada al servicio son las siguientes: mantenimiento de SLA (perspectiva de arriba hacia abajo): el intervalo de tiempo entre el primer síntoma (reconocido por proveedor, herramientas de gestión de redes o clientes) que un serviciono funciona correctamente y la reparación de fallas verificada debe minimizarse. Esto es especialmente necesario con respecto a los SLA, ya que dichos acuerdos a menudo contienen garantías como un momento medio de reparación. Reducción del esfuerzo (perspectiva de arriba hacia abajo): si varios informes de problemas del usuario son síntomas de la misma falla, el procesamiento de fallas debe realizarse solo una vez y no varias veces. Si la falla ha sido reparada, los clientes afectados deben estar informados sobre esto automáticamente. Análisis de impacto (perspectiva ascendente): en el caso de una falla en un recurso, se puede determinar su influencia en los servicios asociados y los clientes afectados. Este análisis se puede realizar para consideraciones a corto plazo (cuando actualmente hay una falla de recursos) o a largo plazo (por ejemplo, optimización de red).4. Modelado de flujo de trabajo A continuación, examinamos la Biblioteca de infraestructura de TI de gestión de procesos de TI establecida (ITIL) y el mapa mejorado de operaciones de telecomunicaciones (ETOM). El objetivo es descubrir dónde se puede encontrar la correlación de eventos en la estructura del proceso y cuán detallados son actualmente los marcos. Después de eso, presentamos nuestra solución para un modelado de flujo de trabajo para la correlación de eventos orientados al servicio.4.1 Biblioteca de infraestructura de TI (ITIL) La Oficina Británica de Comercio del Gobierno (OGC) y el Foro de Gestión de Servicios de TI (ITSMF) [9] proporcionan una colección de mejores prácticas para los procesos de TI en el área de la gestión de servicios de TI que se llama ITIL. La administración del servicio se describe mediante 11 módulos que se agrupan en el conjunto de soporte de servicio (procesos internos del proveedor) y el conjunto de prestación de servicios (procesos en la interfaz del proveedor del cliente). Cada módulo describe procesos, funciones, roles y responsabilidades, así como las bases de datos e interfaces necesarias. En general, ITIL describe el contenido, los procesos y el objetivo de un alto nivel de abstracción y no contiene información sobre arquitecturas y herramientas de gestión. La gestión de fallas se divide en el proceso de gestión de incidentes y el proceso de gestión de problemas. Gestión de incidentes: la gestión de incidentes contiene la mesa de servicio como interfaz para los clientes (por ejemplo, recibe informes sobre problemas de servicio). En caso de errores graves, consultas estructuradas se transfieren a la gestión del problema. Gestión de problemas: las tareas de gestión de problemas son resolver problemas, ocuparse de mantener prioridades, minimizar la recurrencia de problemas y proporcionar información de gestión. Después de recibir solicitudes de la gestión de incidentes, el problema debe identificarse y la información sobre las contramedidas necesarias se transfiere a la gestión del cambio. Los procesos de ITIL describen solo lo que hay que hacer, pero no contienen información sobre cómo se puede realizar esto. Como consecuencia, la correlación del evento no es parte del modelado. Los incidentes de ITIL podrían considerarse como la entrada para la correlación de eventos orientada al servicio, mientras que la salida podría usarse como una consulta para la gestión de problemas de ITIL.4.2 Mapa mejorado de operaciones de telecomunicaciones (ETOM) El Foro de Telemanagement (TMF) [18] es una organización internacional sin fines de lucro de proveedores y proveedores de servicios en el área de servicios de telecomunicaciones. Similar a ITIL, se ha desarrollado un marco orientado al proceso al principio, pero el marco fue diseñado para un enfoque más estrecho, es decir, el mercado de proveedores de servicios de información y comunicaciones. Se realiza una agrupación horizontal en procesos para atención al cliente, desarrollo y operaciones de servicios, gestión de redes y sistemas, y socio/proveedor. La agrupación vertical (cumplimiento, garantía, facturación) refleja el ciclo de vida del servicio. En el área de gestión de fallas se han definido tres procesos a lo largo de la agrupación de procesos horizontales. Manejo de problemas: el propósito de este proceso es recibir informes de problemas de los clientes y resolverlos utilizando la gestión de problemas del servicio. El objetivo también es mantener al cliente informado sobre el estado actual del procesamiento del informe de problemas, así como sobre el estado general de la red (por ejemplo, mantenimiento planificado). También es una tarea de este proceso informar la gestión de 186 QoS/SLA sobre el impacto de los errores actuales en los SLA. Gestión de problemas de servicio: en este proceso, los informes sobre las fallas del servicio que afectan al cliente se reciben y transforman. Se identifican sus causas raíz y se establece una solución problemática o una solución temporal. La tarea del subproceso de diagnóstico del problema es encontrar la causa raíz del problema realizando pruebas apropiadas. No se dice nada cómo se puede hacer esto (por ejemplo, no se menciona ninguna correlación de eventos). Gestión de problemas de recursos: un subproceso de la gestión de problemas de recursos es responsable del análisis de eventos de falla de recursos, correlación y filtrado de alarmas, y la detección e informes de eventos de falla. Otro subproceso se usa para ejecutar diferentes pruebas para encontrar una falla de recursos. También hay otro subproceso que realiza un seguimiento sobre el estado del procesamiento del informe de problemas. Este subproceso es similar a la funcionalidad de un sistema de boletos de problemas. La descripción del proceso en ETOM no es muy detallada. Es útil tener una lista de verificación que los aspectos para estos procesos deben tenerse en cuenta, pero no hay un modelado detallado de las relaciones y no hay metodología para aplicar el marco. La correlación del evento solo se menciona en la gestión de recursos, pero no se utiliza en el nivel de servicio.4.3 Modelado de flujo de trabajo para la correlación de eventos orientada al servicio La Fig. 2 muestra un escenario de servicio general que utilizaremos como base para el modelado de flujo de trabajo para la correlación de eventos orientados al servicio. Suponemos que las dependencias ya se conocen (por ejemplo, mediante el uso de los enfoques mencionados en la Sección 2). El proveedor ofrece diferentes servicios que dependen de otros servicios llamados Subservices (Dependencia del Servicio). Existe otro tipo de dependencia entre servicios/subservicios y recursos. Estas dependencias se denominan dependencias de recursos. Estos dos tipos de dependencias en la mayoría de los casos no se utilizan para la correlación de eventos realizada hoy. Esta correlación de eventos orientada a recursos solo trata con relaciones en el nivel de recursos (por ejemplo, topología de red).Servicios de recursos de dependencia de servicios Servicios Servicios Dependencia de recursos Figura 2: Diferentes tipos de dependencias para la correlación de eventos orientados al servicio Las dependencias representadas en la Figura 2 reflejan una situación sin redundancia en el aprovisionamiento del servicio. Las relaciones pueden verse como y relaciones. En caso de redundancia, si, por ejemplo, un proveedor tiene 3 servidores web independientes, se debe utilizar otro modelado (ver Figura 3) (o relación). En tal caso, son posibles diferentes relaciones. El servicio podría verse funcionando correctamente si uno de los servidores está funcionando o si un cierto porcentaje de ellos está funcionando.servicios) y relación b) o recursos de relación Figura 3: Modelado de no redundancia (a) y de redundancia (b) ya que tanto ITIL como ETOM no contienen descripción de cómo se debe realizar la correlación de eventos y especialmente la correlación de eventos orientada a los servicios, proponemosEl siguiente diseño para dicho flujo de trabajo (ver Fig. 4). Los componentes adicionales que no forman parte de una correlación de eventos orientada al dispositivo se representan con un fondo gris. El flujo de trabajo se divide en la detección de fallas de fases, diagnóstico de fallas y recuperación de fallas. En la fase de detección de fallas, los eventos de recursos y los eventos de servicio se pueden generar a partir de diferentes fuentes. Los eventos de recursos se emiten durante el uso de un recurso, por ejemplo, a través de trampas SNMP. Los eventos de servicio se originan a partir de informes de problemas del cliente, que se informan a través del punto de acceso de gestión del servicio al cliente (ver más abajo). Además de estas dos formas pasivas de obtener los eventos, un proveedor también puede realizar pruebas activas. Estas pruebas pueden tratar los recursos (sondeo activo de recursos) o pueden asumir el papel de un cliente virtual y probar un servicio o uno de sus subservicios realizando interacciones en los puntos de acceso al servicio (sondeo activo de servicio). La fase de diagnóstico de fallas se compone de tres pasos de correlación de eventos. El primero es realizado por el Correlador de eventos de recursos que puede considerarse como el correlador de eventos en los sistemas comerciales de hoy. Por lo tanto, solo trata con eventos de recursos. El correlacionador de eventos de servicio hace una correlación de los eventos de servicio, mientras que el correlador de eventos agregados finalmente realiza una correlación de los eventos de recursos y servicios. Si el resultado de la correlación en uno de los pasos de correlación mejorará, es posible volver a la fase de detección de fallas y comenzar el sondeo activo para obtener eventos adicionales. Estos eventos pueden ser útiles para confirmar un resultado de correlación o para reducir la lista de posibles causas raíz. Después de la correlación del evento, la gestión de recursos verifica una lista ordenada de posibles causas raíz. Cuando se encuentra la causa raíz, comienza la reparación de fallas. Este último paso se realiza en la fase de recuperación de fallas. Las siguientes subsecciones presentan diferentes elementos del proceso de correlación de eventos.4.4 Gestión del servicio al cliente y asistente inteligente El punto de acceso de gestión del servicio al cliente (CSM) fue propuesto por [13] como una interfaz única entre el cliente 187 DISPARIO DE FALLA DIAGNOSH FALLA DIAGNOS DE RECUSO ACTIVO Evento de recursos de recursos de recursos de recursos Correlador de recursos de recursos Lista de recursos de recursos de fallasSERVICIO ACTIVO SERVICIO INTELIGENTES Correlador de eventos Aggregato Correlador de eventos EventCSM AP Figura 4: Flujo de trabajo de correlación de eventos y proveedor. Su funcionalidad es proporcionar información al cliente sobre sus servicios suscritos, por ejemplo, informes sobre el cumplimiento de los SLA acordados. También se puede utilizar para suscribir servicios o para permitir que el cliente administre sus servicios de manera restringida. Se pueden enviar informes sobre problemas con un servicio al cliente a través de CSM. El CSM también está contenido en el modelo de servicio MNM (ver Sección 5). Para reducir el esfuerzo para el apoyo de primer nivel de los proveedores, se puede agregar un asistente inteligente al CSM. El asistente inteligente estructura la información de los clientes sobre un problema de servicio. La información que se necesita para una previsión del problema se recopila de una lista de preguntas al cliente. La lista no es estática ya que la pregunta actual depende de las respuestas a preguntas anteriores o del resultado de pruebas específicas. Se utiliza un árbol de decisión para estructurar las preguntas y pruebas. Las pruebas permiten al cliente obtener un acceso controlado a la gestión de los proveedores. En el LRZ, un cliente del servicio de correo electrónico puede, por ejemplo, usar el asistente inteligente para realizar solicitudes de ping al servidor de correo. Pero también podrían ser posibles solicitudes más complejas, por ejemplo, solicitudes de una combinación de variables SNMP.4.5 Probación activa El sondeo activo es útil para que el proveedor verifique sus servicios ofrecidos. El objetivo es identificar y reaccionar a los problemas antes de que un cliente los note. El sondeo se puede realizar desde un punto de vista del cliente o probando los recursos que forman parte de los servicios. También puede ser útil realizar pruebas de subservicios (subservicios propios o subservicios ofrecidos por los proveedores). Son posibles diferentes horarios para realizar el sondeo activo. El proveedor podría seleccionar probar servicios y recursos importantes en intervalos de tiempo regulares. Otras pruebas podrían ser iniciadas por un usuario que atraviese el árbol de decisión del asistente inteligente, incluidas las pruebas activas. Otra posibilidad para el uso de sondeo activo es una solicitud del correlacionador de eventos, si el resultado de correlación actual debe mejorarse. Los resultados del sondeo activo se informan a través de eventos de servicio o recursos al correlacionador de eventos (o si la prueba fue exigida por el asistente inteligente, el resultado también se le informa). Si bien los eventos que se reciben de las herramientas de gestión y los clientes denotan eventos negativos (algo no funciona), los eventos de la investigación activa también deben contener eventos positivos para una mejor discriminación.4.6 Correlador de eventos La correlación del evento no debe realizarse mediante un único correlacionador de eventos, sino mediante el uso de diferentes pasos. La razón de esto son las diferentes características de las dependencias (ver Fig. 1). En el nivel de recursos solo hay relaciones entre recursos (topología de red, configuración de sistemas). Un ejemplo de esto podría ser un interruptor que vincula LAN separados. Si el interruptor está inactivo, se informan que otros componentes de red que se encuentran detrás del interruptor tampoco son accesibles. Al correlacionar estos eventos, se puede resolver que el interruptor es la causa de error probable. En esta etapa, la integración de eventos de servicio no parece ser útil. El resultado de este paso es una lista de recursos que podrían ser la causa raíz de los problemas. El correlacionador de eventos de recursos se utiliza para realizar este paso. En el escenario orientado al servicio también hay dependencias de servicios y recursos. Como el siguiente paso en el proceso de correlación de eventos, los eventos de servicio deben correlacionarse entre sí utilizando las dependencias del servicio, porque las dependencias del servicio no tienen una relación directa con el nivel de recursos. El resultado de este paso, que realiza el correlacionador de eventos de servicio, es una lista de servicios/subservicios que podrían contener una falla en un recurso. Si, por ejemplo, hay eventos de servicio de clientes que dos servicios no funcionan y ambos servicios dependen de una subservicio común, parece más probable que la falla del recurso se pueda encontrar dentro de la subservicio. La salida de esta correlación es una lista de servicios/subordenios que podría verse afectado por una falla en un recurso asociado. En el último paso, el correlacionador de eventos agregados coincide con las listas del correlacionador de eventos de recursos y el correlacionador de eventos de servicio para encontrar los problemas posibles causa raíz. Esto se hace utilizando las dependencias de recursos. Las técnicas de correlación de eventos presentadas en la Sección 2 podrían usarse para realizar la correlación dentro de los tres correladores de eventos. Si las dependencias se pueden encontrar con precisión, un enfoque de RBR o libro de códigos parece ser apropiado. Se podría usar una base de datos de casos (CBR) si hay casos que no podrían ser cubiertos por RBR o el enfoque del libro de códigos. Estos casos podrían usarse para mejorar el modelado de una manera que RBR o el enfoque del libro de códigos puedan tratarlos en futuras correlaciones.5. Modelado de información En esta sección Utilizamos un modelo genérico para la gestión de servicios de TI para derivar la información necesaria para el proceso de correlación de eventos.5.1 Modelo de servicio MNM El modelo de servicio MNM [5] es un modelo genérico para la gestión de servicios de TI. Se hace una distinción entre el lado del cliente y el lado del proveedor. El lado del cliente contiene el cliente y el usuario de los roles básicos, mientras que el lado del proveedor contiene el proveedor de roles. El proveedor pone el servicio a disposición del lado del cliente. El servicio en su conjunto se divide en el uso al que el usuario y la gerencia acceden a rol que utiliza el cliente de roles. El modelo consta de dos vistas principales. La vista de servicio (ver Fig. 5) muestra una perspectiva común del servicio para el cliente y el proveedor. En este punto de vista, todo lo que solo es importante para la realización del servicio no está contenido. Para estos detalles, se define otra perspectiva, la vista de realización (ver Fig. 6).Suministros de dominio del cliente Suministros Proveedores de proveedores «rol» Accesos de proveedor Utiliza concluir accesos implementos observar la realización proporciona directs sustancia usos usosuses ganages implementsRealizes administra el servicio concluye los parámetros de QoS de los parámetros de uso de la gestión de acceso de la gestión de la gestión del servicio de la implementación del servicio de la implementación del servicio de la implementación de la implementación del servicio de la gestiónServicio de punto de acceso CSM Cliente CLIME CLIME Figura 5: Vista de servicio La vista de servicio contiene el servicio para el cual se define la funcionalidad para el uso y para la administración. Hay dos puntos de acceso (punto de acceso del servicio y punto de acceso CSM) donde el usuario y el cliente pueden acceder a la funcionalidad de uso y gestión, respectivamente. Asociado a cada servicio hay una lista de parámetros de QoS que el servicio debe cumplir en el punto de acceso del servicio. La vigilancia de QoS es realizada por la gerencia.Provider Domain implementos ObserveSeRealizes proporciona directs implementsRealizes Access Usos Concluyendo Accesos Usos Usos Maneje el lado Independiente Independent Independent Manages Manages concluye los actos como Servicio Implementación de la gestión de servicios Manages Usos de Servicio Logic Subservicio Cliente Servicio Cliente CLISE CLISE USE RECURSOS Usos Managemento de servicio Sub-servicio Sub-servicio Sub-servicioGestión Cliente Funcionalidad de gestión básica «rol» Cliente «rol» Proveedor «rol» Usuario Figura 6: Vista de realización En la vista de realización La implementación del servicio y la implementación de la gestión del servicio se describen en detalle. Para ambos hay recursos y subservicios internos del proveedor. Para la implementación del servicio, una lógica de servicio utiliza recursos internos (dispositivos, conocimiento, personal) y subconjuntos externos para proporcionar el servicio. Análoga, la implementación de gestión de servicios incluye una lógica de gestión de servicios que utiliza funcionalidades de gestión básica [8] y subservicios de gestión externa. El modelo de servicio MNM se puede utilizar para un modelado similar de los subservicios usados, es decir, el modelo se puede aplicar de manera recursiva. Como la correlación de eventos orientada al servicio tiene que utilizar las dependencias de un servicio a partir de subservicios y recursos, el modelo se utiliza a continuación para obtener la información necesaria para los eventos de servicio.5.2 Modelado de información para eventos de servicio La correlación de eventos de hoy se trata principalmente de eventos que se originan a partir de recursos. Además de un identificador de recursos, estos eventos contienen información sobre el estado de recursos, por ejemplo, variables SNMP. Para realizar una correlación de eventos orientada al servicio, es necesario definir eventos relacionados con los servicios. Estos eventos pueden generarse a partir de la propia vigilancia de servicios de los proveedores o a partir de informes de clientes en la interfaz CSM. Contienen información sobre los problemas con el QoS acordado. En nuestro modelado de información definimos una superclase de evento que contiene atributos comunes (por ejemplo, sello de tiempo). Evento de recursos y eventos de servicio heredado de esta superclase. Derivado del modelo de servicio MNM, definimos la información necesaria para un evento de servicio. SERVICIO: Como un evento de servicio representará los problemas de un solo servicio, aquí se contiene una identificación única del servicio afectado. Descripción del evento: Este campo debe contener una descripción del problema. Dependiendo de las interacciones en el punto de acceso del servicio (vista de servicio) se debe definir una clasificación del problema en diferentes categorías. También debería ser posible agregar una descripción informal del problema. Los parámetros de QoS: para cada servicio se definen los parámetros de QoS (vista de servicio) entre el proveedor y el cliente. Este campo representa una lista de estos parámetros de QoS y niveles de servicio acordados. La lista puede ayudar al proveedor a establecer la prioridad de un problema con respecto a los niveles de servicio acordados. Lista de recursos: esta lista contiene los recursos (vista de realización) que son necesarias para proporcionar el servicio. El proveedor utiliza esta lista para verificar si uno de estos recursos causa el problema. Identificación del evento de servicio de subservicio: en la jerarquía de servicio (vista de realización), el servicio, para el cual se ha emitido este evento de servicio, puede depender de los subservicios. Si existe la sospecha de que uno de estos subconjuntos causa el problema, los eventos de servicio infantil se emiten desde este evento de servicio para los subservicios. En tal caso, este campo contiene enlaces a los eventos correspondientes. Otras identificaciones de eventos: en el proceso de correlación del evento, el evento de servicio puede correlacionarse con otros eventos de servicio o con eventos de recursos. Este campo luego contiene enlaces a otros eventos que se han correlacionado con este evento de servicio. Esto es útil, por ejemplo, enviar un mensaje común a todos los clientes afectados cuando sus servicios suscritos están disponibles nuevamente. Identificación de los emisores: Este campo puede contener una identificación del cliente que informó el problema, una identificación de un empleado de proveedores de servicios 189 (en caso de que la falla haya sido detectada por la prueba activa de servicio de los proveedores) o un enlace a un evento de servicio principal. La identificación es necesaria, si hay ambigüedades en el evento de servicio o que el emisor se debe informar (por ejemplo, que el servicio está disponible nuevamente). Los posibles emisores se refieren a los roles básicos (cliente, proveedor) en el modelo de servicio. Asignado: para realizar un seguimiento del procesamiento del nombre y la dirección del empleado de los proveedores que está resolviendo o resuelto el problema también se observa. Esta es una especialización del papel del proveedor en el modelo de servicio. Fechas: Este campo contiene fechas clave en el procesamiento del evento de servicio, como la fecha inicial, la fecha de identificación del problema, la fecha de resolución. Estas fechas son importantes para realizar un seguimiento de la rapidez con que se han resuelto los problemas. Estado: Este campo representa el estado real de los eventos de servicio (por ejemplo, activo, suspendido, resuelto). Prioridad: La prioridad muestra qué importancia tiene el evento de servicio desde la perspectiva de los proveedores. La importancia se deriva del acuerdo de servicio, especialmente los parámetros de QoS acordados (vista de servicio). La fecha de los campos, el estado y otros eventos de servicio no se derivan directamente del modelo de servicio, sino que son necesarios para el proceso de correlación de eventos.6. Aplicación de la correlación de eventos orientados al servicio para un escenario de alojamiento web El Centro de Supercomputación de Leibniz es el Centro de Computación Conjunta para las Universidades e Instituciones de Investigación de Munich. También ejecuta la red científica de Munich y ofrece servicios relacionados. Uno de estos servicios es el servidor WWW virtual, una oferta de alojamiento web para instituciones de investigación más pequeñas. Actualmente tiene aproximadamente 200 clientes. Una subservicio del servidor WWW virtual es el servicio de almacenamiento que almacena las páginas web estáticas y dinámicas y utiliza técnicas de almacenamiento en caché para un acceso rápido. Otros subservicios son el servicio DNS y IP. Cuando un usuario accede a un sitio web alojado a través de una de las redes privadas virtuales LRZS, también se utiliza el servicio VPN. Los recursos del servidor WWW virtual incluyen un equilibrador de carga y 5 servidores redundantes. Las conexiones de red también son parte de los recursos, así como de la aplicación Apache Web Server que se ejecuta en los servidores. La Figura 7 muestra las dependencias del servidor www virtual.6.1 Gestión de servicio al cliente y asistente inteligente El asistente inteligente que está disponible en el Centro de Supercomputación de Leibniz se puede utilizar actualmente para problemas de conectividad o rendimiento o problemas con el servicio de correo electrónico LRZ. Una selección de posibles informes de problemas del cliente para el servidor WWW virtual se proporciona a continuación: • El sitio web alojado no es accesible.• El acceso al sitio web es (también) lento.• El sitio web contiene contenido obsoleto.servidor Serverver Server Server Server Server Server Server Conexión saliente Hosting de LRZS Páginas propias Contenido Caching Server Servidor de emergencia Servidor Webmail Server Dinámico Páginas web dinámicas Páginas web estáticas DNS Recursos de almacenamiento de proxyip: Servicios: Servidor virtual WWW Cinco servidores redundantes AFS NFS Balancer DBLOAD Figura 7: Dependencias deEl servidor WWW virtual • La transferencia de nuevo contenido al LRZ no cambia el contenido proporcionado.• El sitio web se ve extraño (por ejemplo, causado por problemas con la versión HTML), estos informes del cliente deben asignarse a fallas en recursos. Para, por ejemplo, un sitio web inalcanzable son posibles diferentes causas raíz como un problema de DNS, problema de conectividad, configuración incorrecta del equilibrador de carga.6.2 Probación activa En general, el sondeo activo se puede utilizar para servicios o recursos. Para el servicio de sondeo activo del servidor www virtual se podría instalar un cliente virtual. Este cliente realiza solicitudes típicas de HTTP de sitios web y compara la respuesta con el contenido conocido. Para verificar la actualización de un sitio web de prueba, el contenido podría contener una marca de tiempo. El sondeo activo del servicio también podría incluir la prueba de subservicios, por ejemplo, enviando solicitudes al DNS. El sondeo activo de recursos realiza pruebas de los recursos. Ejemplos son las pruebas de conectividad, las solicitudes a los procesos de solicitud y las pruebas de espacio en disco disponible.6.3 Correlación de eventos para el servidor WWW virtual La Figura 8 muestra el procesamiento de ejemplo. Al principio, un cliente que echa un vistazo a su sitio web alojado informa que el contenido que había cambiado no se muestra correctamente. Este informe se transfiere a la administración del servicio a través de la interfaz CSM. Se podría utilizar un asistente inteligente para estructurar el informe del cliente. La gestión de servicios traduce el informe del cliente en un evento de servicio. Independientemente del informe del cliente, los proveedores de servicios propios de servicio activo intenta cambiar el contenido de un sitio web de prueba. Debido a que esto no es posible, se emite un evento de servicio. Mientras tanto, se ha informado un evento de recursos al Correlador de eventos, porque el acceso al servidor de almacenamiento en caché de contenido a uno de los servidores www falló. Como no hay otros eventos en este momento, la correlación de eventos de recursos 190 Servicio CSM CMMT MGMT Correlador de eventos Recursos MGMT Informes del cliente: Contenido del sitio web No es actualización Informes de sondeo activo de servicio: Cambio de contenido del sitio web No posible Evento: Servidor del servidorContenido fallido Event avanzando a reenviar el evento de la correlación del evento Correlación de eventos Correlación AGREGADO Evento Correlación Enlace Informe de fallas Evento Reenviar Reenvío WWW Comprobación del servidor Resultado Visualización del enlace Resultado Resultado del resultado del cliente Figura 8: El procesamiento de ejemplo de un informe del cliente no puede correlacionar este evento a otros eventos. En esta etapa, sería posible que el Correlador del evento solicite a la gestión de recursos que realice un sondeo activo de recursos relacionados. Ambos eventos de servicio ahora se transfieren al correlacionador de eventos de servicio y están correlacionados. A partir de la correlación de estos eventos, parece probable que el servidor www o el enlace al servidor www sea la causa raíz de los problemas. Un procedimiento de actualización del sitio web incorrecto dentro del servidor de almacenamiento en caché de contenido parece ser menos probable, ya que esto solo explica el informe del cliente y no el resultado de sondeo activo del servicio. En esta etapa, se podría iniciar una investigación activa del servicio, pero esto no parece ser útil ya que esta correlación solo trata con el servicio de alojamiento web y sus recursos y no con otros servicios. Después de la correlación separada de los eventos de recursos y servicios, que se pueden realizar en paralelo, el correlacionador de eventos agregados se utiliza para correlacionar ambos tipos de eventos. El evento de recursos adicionales hace que parezca mucho más probable que los problemas sean causados por un enlace roto al servidor www o por el servidor www y no por el servidor de almacenamiento en caché de contenido. En este caso, el Correlador del evento solicita a la administración de recursos que verifique el enlace y el servidor www. La decisión entre estas dos causas de error probables no se puede automatizar más aquí. Más tarde, la gestión de recursos descubre que un enlace roto es la causa raíz de las fallas. Informa al Correlador del evento sobre esto y se puede determinar que esto explica todos los eventos anteriores. Por lo tanto, la correlación del evento se puede detener en este punto. Dependiendo de la gestión de la relación con el cliente de los proveedores, el hallazgo de la causa raíz y el tiempo de reparación esperado podría informarse a los clientes. Después de que se haya reparado el enlace, es posible informar este evento a través de la interfaz CSM. Aunque muchos detalles de este proceso de correlación de eventos también podrían realizarse de manera diferente, el ejemplo mostró una ventaja importante de la correlación del evento orientado al servicio. La relación entre el aprovisionamiento de servicios y los recursos de los proveedores se modela explícitamente. Esto permite un mapeo del informe del cliente en los recursos internos del proveedor.6.4 Correlación de eventos para diferentes servicios si un proveedor como el LRZ ofrece varios servicios, la correlación de eventos orientados al servicio puede usarse para revelar relaciones que no son obvias en primer lugar. Si el servicio de correo electrónico de LRZ y sus eventos se ven en relación con los eventos para el servidor WWW virtual, es posible identificar fallas en suborden y recursos comunes. Ambos servicios dependen del DNS, lo que significa que los informes de los clientes como yo no puedo recuperar un nuevo correo electrónico y el sitio web de mi Instituto de Investigación no está disponible puede tener una causa común, por ejemplo, el DNS no funciona correctamente.7. Conclusión y trabajo futuro en nuestro documento mostramos la necesidad de una correlación de eventos orientada al servicio. Para un proveedor de servicios de TI, este nuevo tipo de correlación de eventos permite asignar automáticamente los problemas con la calidad del servicio actual en las fallas de recursos. Esto ayuda a encontrar la causa raíz de las fallas antes y a reducir los costos de violaciones de SLA. Además, los informes de los clientes se pueden vincular y, por lo tanto, el esfuerzo de procesamiento puede reducirse. Para recibir estos beneficios, presentamos nuestro enfoque para realizar la correlación de eventos orientada al servicio, así como un modelado de la información de correlación necesaria. En el futuro, vamos a aplicar nuestro flujo de trabajo e modelado de información para los servicios ofrecidos por el Centro de Supercomputación de Leibniz en detalles. Varios problemas no se han tratado en detalle hasta ahora, por ejemplo, las consecuencias para la correlación de eventos orientada al servicio si otro proveedor ofrece un subservicio. Si un servicio no funciona correctamente, debe determinarse si esto es causado por el mismo proveedor o por el subservicio. En el último caso, se debe intercambiar información apropiada entre los proveedores a través de la interfaz CSM. Otro problema es el uso de sondeo activo en el proceso de correlación de eventos que puede mejorar el resultado, pero también puede conducir a un retraso de correlación. Otro punto importante es la definición precisa de dependencia que también ha dejado fuera por muchas otras publicaciones. Para evitar tener muchas dependencias en una determinada situación, uno podría tratar de verificar si las dependencias existen actualmente. En el caso de una descarga desde un sitio web, solo hay una dependencia del subservicio de DNS al principio, pero después de que se resuelve la dirección, es poco probable que la falla de descarga haya sido causada por el DNS. Otra posibilidad para reducir las dependencias es dividir un servicio en sus posibles interacciones del usuario (por ejemplo, un servicio de correo electrónico a transacciones como Get Mail, Enviar correo, etc.) y definir las dependencias para cada interacción del usuario.

        "The latter refers to the case of recognizing the influence of a device breakdown on the offered services.",
        "As in this scenario the knowledge about services and their SLAs is used we call it service-oriented.",
        "It can be addressed from two directions.",
        "Top-down perspective: Several customers report a problem in a certain time interval.",
        "Are these trouble reports correlated?",
        "How to identify a resource as being the problems root cause? 183 Bottom-up perspective: A device (e.g., router, server) breaks down.",
        "Which services, and especially which customers, are affected by this fault?",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe how event correlation is performed today and present a selection of the state-of-the-art event correlation techniques.",
        "Section 3 describes the motivation for serviceoriented event correlation and its benefits.",
        "After having motivated the need for such type of correlation we use two well-known IT service management models to gain requirements for an appropriate workflow modeling and present our proposal for it (see Section 4).",
        "In Section 5 we present our information modeling which is derived from the MNM Service Model.",
        "An application of the approach for a web hosting scenario is performed in Section 6.",
        "The last section concludes the paper and presents future work. 2.",
        "TODAYS EVENT CORRELATION TECHNIQUES In [11] the task of event correlation is defined as a conceptual interpretation procedure in the sense that a new meaning is assigned to a set of events that happen in a certain time interval.",
        "We can distinguish between three aspects for event correlation.",
        "Functional aspect: The correlation focuses on functions which are provided by each network element.",
        "It is also regarded which other functions are used to provide a specific function.",
        "Topology aspect: The correlation takes into account how the network elements are connected to each other and how they interact.",
        "Time aspect: When explicitly regarding time constraints, a start and end time has to be defined for each event.",
        "The correlation can use time relationships between the events to perform the correlation.",
        "This aspect is only mentioned in some papers [11], but it has to be treated in an event correlation system.",
        "In the event correlation it is also important to distinguish between the knowledge acquisition/representation and the correlation algorithm.",
        "Examples of approaches to knowledge acquisition/representation are Gruschkes dependency graphs [6] and Ensels dependency detection by neural networks [3].",
        "It is also possible to find the dependencies by analyzing interactions [7].",
        "In addition, there is an approach to manage service dependencies with XML and to define a resource description framework [4].",
        "To get an overview about device-oriented event correlation a selection of several event correlation techniques being used for this kind of correlation is presented.",
        "Model-based reasoning: Model-based reasoning (MBR) [15, 10, 20] represents a system by modeling each of its components.",
        "A model can either represent a physical entity or a logical entity (e.g., LAN, WAN, domain, service, business process).",
        "The models for physical entities are called functional model, while the models for all logical entities are called logical model.",
        "A description of each model contains three categories of information: attributes, relations to other models, and behavior.",
        "The event correlation is a result of the collaboration among models.",
        "As all components of a network are represented with their behavior in the model, it is possible to perform simulations to predict how the whole network will behave.",
        "A comparison in [20] showed that a large MBR system is not in all cases easy to maintain.",
        "It can be difficult to appropriately model the behavior for all components and their interactions correctly and completely.",
        "An example system for MBR is NetExpert[16] from OSI which is a hybrid MBR/RBR system (in 2000 OSI was acquired by Agilent Technologies).",
        "Rule-based reasoning: Rule-based reasoning (RBR) [15, 10] uses a set of rules for event correlation.",
        "The rules have the form conclusion if condition.",
        "The condition uses received events and information about the system, while the conclusion contains actions which can either lead to system changes or use system parameters to choose the next rule.",
        "An advantage of the approach is that the rules are more or less human-readable and therefore their effect is intuitive.",
        "The correlation has proved to be very fast in practice by using the RETE algorithm.",
        "In the literature [20, 1] it is claimed that RBR systems are classified as relatively inflexible.",
        "Frequent changes in the modeled IT environment would lead to many rule updates.",
        "These changes would have to be performed by experts as no automation has currently been established.",
        "In some systems information about the network topology which is needed for the event correlation is not used explicitly, but is encoded into the rules.",
        "This intransparent usage would make rule updates for topology changes quite difficult.",
        "The system brittleness would also be a problem for RBR systems.",
        "It means that the system fails if an unknown case occurs, because the case cannot be mapped onto similar cases.",
        "The output of RBR systems would also be difficult to predict, because of unforeseen rule interactions in a large rule set.",
        "According to [15] an RBR system is only appropriate if the domain for which it is used is small, nonchanging, and well understood.",
        "The GTE IMPACT system [11] is an example of a rulebased system.",
        "It also uses MBR (GTE has merged with Bell Atlantic in 1998 and is now called Verizon [19]).",
        "Codebook approach: The codebook approach [12, 21] has similarities to RBR, but takes a further step and encodes the rules into a correlation matrix.",
        "The approach starts using a dependency graph with two kinds of nodes for the modeling.",
        "The first kind of nodes are the faults (denoted as problems in the cited papers) which have to be detected, while the second kind of nodes are observable events (symptoms in the papers) which are caused by the faults or other events.",
        "The dependencies between the nodes are denoted as directed edges.",
        "It is possible to choose weights for the edges, e.g., a weight for the probability that 184 fault/event A causes event B.",
        "Another possible weighting could indicate time dependencies.",
        "There are several possibilities to reduce the initial graph.",
        "If, e.g., a cyclic dependency of events exists and there are no probabilities for the cycles edges, all events can be treated as one event.",
        "After a final input graph is chosen, the graph is transformed into a correlation matrix where the columns contain the faults and the rows contain the events.",
        "If there is a dependency in the graph, the weight of the corresponding edge is put into the according matrix cell.",
        "In case no weights are used, the matrix cells get the values 1 for dependency and 0 otherwise.",
        "Afterwards, a simplification can be done, where events which do not help to discriminate faults are deleted.",
        "There is a trade-off between the minimization of the matrix and the robustness of the results.",
        "If the matrix is minimized as much as possible, some faults can only be distinguished by a single event.",
        "If this event cannot be reliably detected, the event correlation system cannot discriminate between the two faults.",
        "A measure how many event observation errors can be compensated by the system is the Hamming distance.",
        "The number of rows (events) that can be deleted from the matrix can differ very much depending on the relationships [15].",
        "The codebook approach has the advantage that it uses long-term experience with graphs and coding.",
        "This experience is used to minimize the dependency graph and to select an optimal group of events with respect to processing time and robustness against noise.",
        "A disadvantage of the approach could be that similar to RBR frequent changes in the environment make it necessary to frequently edit the input graph.",
        "SMARTS InCharge [12, 17] is an example of such a correlation system.",
        "Case-based reasoning: In contrast to other approaches case-based reasoning (CBR) [14, 15] systems do not use any knowledge about the system structure.",
        "The knowledge base saves cases with their values for system parameters and successful recovery actions for these cases.",
        "The recovery actions are not performed by the CBR system in the first place, but in most cases by a human operator.",
        "If a new case appears, the CBR system compares the current system parameters with the system parameters in prior cases and tries to find a similar one.",
        "To identify such a match it has to be defined for which parameters the cases can differ or have to be the same.",
        "If a match is found, a learned action can be performed automatically or the operator can be informed with a recovery proposal.",
        "An advantage of this approach is that the ability to learn is an integral part of it which is important for rapid changing environments.",
        "There are also difficulties when applying the approach [15].",
        "The fields which are used to find a similar case and their importance have to be defined appropriately.",
        "If there is a match with a similar case, an adaptation of the previous solution to the current one has to be found.",
        "An example system for CBR is SpectroRx from Cabletron Systems.",
        "The part of Cabletron that developed SpectroRx became an independent software company in 2002 and is now called Aprisma Management Technologies [2].",
        "In this section four event correlation approaches were presented which have evolved into commercial event correlation systems.",
        "The correlation approaches have different focuses.",
        "MBR mainly deals with the knowledge acquisition and representation, while RBR and the codebook approach propose a correlation algorithm.",
        "The focus of CBR is its ability to learn from prior cases. 3.",
        "MOTIVATION OF SERVICE-ORIENTED EVENT CORRELATION Fig. 1 shows a general service scenario upon which we will discuss the importance of a service-oriented correlation.",
        "Several services like SSH, a web hosting service, or a video conference service are offered by a provider to its customers at the customer provider interface.",
        "A customer can allow several users to use a subscribed service.",
        "The quality and cost issues of the subscribed services between a customer and a provider are agreed in SLAs.",
        "On the provider side the services use subservices for their provisioning.",
        "In case of the services mentioned above such subservices are DNS, proxy service, and IP service.",
        "Both services and subservices depend on resources upon which they are provisioned.",
        "As displayed in the figure a service can depend on more than one resource and a resource can be used by one or more services.",
        "SSH DNS proxy IP service dependency resource dependency user a user b user c customer SLA web a video conf.",
        "SSH sun1 provider video conf. web services subservices resources Figure 1: Scenario To get a common understanding, we distinguish between different types of events: Resource event: We use the term resource event for network events and system events.",
        "A network event refers to events like node up/down or link up/down whereas system events refer to events like server down or authentication failure.",
        "Service event: A service event indicates that a service does not work properly.",
        "A trouble ticket which is generated from a customer report is a kind of such an 185 event.",
        "Other service events can be generated by the provider of a service, if the provider himself detects a service malfunction.",
        "In such a scenario the provider may receive service events from customers which indicate that SSH, web hosting service, and video conference service are not available.",
        "When referring to the service hierarchy, the provider can conclude in such a case that all services depend on DNS.",
        "Therefore, it seems more likely that a common resource which is necessary for this service does not work properly or is not available than to assume three independent service failures.",
        "In contrast to a resource-oriented perspective where all of the service events would have to be processed separately, the service events can be linked together.",
        "Their information can be aggregated and processed only once.",
        "If, e.g., the problem is solved, one common message to the customers that their services are available again is generated and distributed by using the list of linked service events.",
        "This is certainly a simplified example.",
        "However, it shows the general principle of identifying the common subservices and common resources of different services.",
        "It is important to note that the service-oriented perspective is needed to integrate service aspects, especially QoS aspects.",
        "An example of such an aspect is that a fault does not lead to a total failure of a service, but its QoS parameters, respectively agreed service levels, at the customer-provider interface might not be met.",
        "A degradation in service quality which is caused by high traffic load on the backbone is another example.",
        "In the resource-oriented perspective it would be possible to define events which indicate that there is a link usage higher than a threshold, but no mechanism has currently been established to find out which services are affected and whether a QoS violation occurs.",
        "To summarize, the reasons for the necessity of a serviceoriented event correlation are the following: Keeping of SLAs (top-down perspective): The time interval between the first symptom (recognized either by provider, network management tools, or customers) that a service does not perform properly and the verified fault repair needs to be minimized.",
        "This is especially needed with respect to SLAs as such agreements often contain guarantees like a mean time to repair.",
        "Effort reduction (top-down perspective): If several user trouble reports are symptoms of the same fault, fault processing should be performed only once and not several times.",
        "If the fault has been repaired, the affected customers should be informed about this automatically.",
        "Impact analysis (bottom-up perspective): In case of a fault in a resource, its influence on the associated services and affected customers can be determined.",
        "This analysis can be performed for short term (when there is currently a resource failure) or long term (e.g., network optimization) considerations. 4.",
        "WORKFLOW MODELING In the following we examine the established IT process management frameworks IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM).",
        "The aim is find out where event correlation can be found in the process structure and how detailed the frameworks currently are.",
        "After that we present our solution for a workflow modeling for the service-oriented event correlation. 4.1 IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) The British Office of Government Commerce (OGC) and the IT Service Management Forum (itSMF) [9] provide a collection of best practices for IT processes in the area of IT service management which is called ITIL.",
        "The service management is described by 11 modules which are grouped into Service Support Set (provider internal processes) and Service Delivery Set (processes at the customer-provider interface).",
        "Each module describes processes, functions, roles, and responsibilities as well as necessary databases and interfaces.",
        "In general, ITIL describes contents, processes, and aims at a high abstraction level and contains no information about management architectures and tools.",
        "The fault management is divided into Incident Management process and Problem Management process.",
        "Incident Management: The Incident Management contains the service desk as interface to customers (e.g., receives reports about service problems).",
        "In case of severe errors structured queries are transferred to the Problem Management.",
        "Problem Management: The Problem Managements tasks are to solve problems, take care of keeping priorities, minimize the reoccurrence of problems, and to provide management information.",
        "After receiving requests from the Incident Management, the problem has to be identified and information about necessary countermeasures is transferred to the Change Management.",
        "The ITIL processes describe only what has to be done, but contain no information how this can be actually performed.",
        "As a consequence, event correlation is not part of the modeling.",
        "The ITIL incidents could be regarded as input for the service-oriented event correlation, while the output could be used as a query to the ITIL Problem Management. 4.2 Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM) The TeleManagement Forum (TMF) [18] is an international non-profit organization from service providers and suppliers in the area of telecommunications services.",
        "Similar to ITIL a process-oriented framework has been developed at first, but the framework was designed for a narrower focus, i.e., the market of information and communications service providers.",
        "A horizontal grouping into processes for customer care, service development & operations, network & systems management, and partner/supplier is performed.",
        "The vertical grouping (fulfillment, assurance, billing) reflects the service life cycle.",
        "In the area of fault management three processes have been defined along the horizontal process grouping.",
        "Problem Handling: The purpose of this process is to receive trouble reports from customers and to solve them by using the Service Problem Management.",
        "The aim is also to keep the customer informed about the current status of the trouble report processing as well as about the general network status (e.g., planned maintenance).",
        "It is also a task of this process to inform the 186 QoS/SLA management about the impact of current errors on the SLAs.",
        "Service Problem Management: In this process reports about customer-affecting service failures are received and transformed.",
        "Their root causes are identified and a problem solution or a temporary workaround is established.",
        "The task of the Diagnose Problem subprocess is to find the root cause of the problem by performing appropriate tests.",
        "Nothing is said how this can be done (e.g., no event correlation is mentioned).",
        "Resource Trouble Management: A subprocess of the Resource Trouble Management is responsible for resource failure event analysis, alarm correlation & filtering, and failure event detection & reporting.",
        "Another subprocess is used to execute different tests to find a resource failure.",
        "There is also another subprocess which keeps track about the status of the trouble report processing.",
        "This subprocess is similar to the functionality of a trouble ticket system.",
        "The process description in eTOM is not very detailed.",
        "It is useful to have a check list which aspects for these processes have to be taken into account, but there is no detailed modeling of the relationships and no methodology for applying the framework.",
        "Event correlation is only mentioned in the resource management, but it is not used in the service level. 4.3 Workflow Modeling for the Service-Oriented Event Correlation Fig. 2 shows a general service scenario which we will use as basis for the workflow modeling for the service-oriented event correlation.",
        "We assume that the dependencies are already known (e.g., by using the approaches mentioned in Section 2).",
        "The provider offers different services which depend on other services called subservices (service dependency).",
        "Another kind of dependency exists between services/subservices and resources.",
        "These dependencies are called resource dependencies.",
        "These two kinds of dependencies are in most cases not used for the event correlation performed today.",
        "This resource-oriented event correlation deals only with relationships on the resource level (e.g., network topology). service dependency resources subservices provider services resource dependency Figure 2: Different kinds of dependencies for the service-oriented event correlation The dependencies depicted in Figure 2 reflect a situation with no redundancy in the service provisioning.",
        "The relationships can be seen as AND relationships.",
        "In case of redundancy, if e.g., a provider has 3 independent web servers, another modeling (see Figure 3) should be used (OR relationship).",

        "The additional components which are not part of a device-oriented event correlation are depicted with a gray background.",
        "The workflow is divided into the phases fault detection, fault diagnosis, and fault recovery.",
        "In the fault detection phase resource events and service events can be generated from different sources.",
        "The resource events are issued during the use of a resource, e.g., via SNMP traps.",
        "The service events are originated from customer trouble reports, which are reported via the Customer Service Management (see below) access point.",
        "In addition to these two passive ways to get the events, a provider can also perform active tests.",
        "These tests can either deal with the resources (resource active probing) or can assume the role of a virtual customer and test a service or one of its subservices by performing interactions at the service access points (service active probing).",
        "The fault diagnosis phase is composed of three event correlation steps.",
        "The first one is performed by the resource event correlator which can be regarded as the event correlator in todays commercial systems.",
        "Therefore, it deals only with resource events.",
        "The service event correlator does a correlation of the service events, while the aggregate event correlator finally performs a correlation of both resource and service events.",
        "If the correlation result in one of the correlation steps shall be improved, it is possible to go back to the fault detection phase and start the active probing to get additional events.",
        "These events can be helpful to confirm a correlation result or to reduce the list of possible root causes.",
        "After the event correlation an ordered list of possible root causes is checked by the resource management.",

        "The next subsections present different elements of the event correlation process. 4.4 Customer Service Management and Intelligent Assistant The Customer Service Management (CSM) access point was proposed by [13] as a single interface between customer 187 fault detection fault diagnosis resource active probing resource event resource event correlator resource management candidate list fault recovery resource usage service active probing intelligent assistant service event correlator aggregate event correlator service eventCSM AP Figure 4: Event correlation workflow and provider.",
        "Its functionality is to provide information to the customer about his subscribed services, e.g., reports about the fulfillment of agreed SLAs.",
        "It can also be used to subscribe services or to allow the customer to manage his services in a restricted way.",
        "Reports about problems with a service can be sent to the customer via CSM.",
        "The CSM is also contained in the MNM Service Model (see Section 5).",
        "To reduce the effort for the providers first level support, an Intelligent Assistant can be added to the CSM.",
        "The Intelligent Assistant structures the customers information about a service problem.",
        "The information which is needed for a preclassification of the problem is gathered from a list of questions to the customer.",
        "The list is not static as the current question depends on the answers to prior questions or from the result of specific tests.",
        "A decision tree is used to structure the questions and tests.",
        "The tests allow the customer to gain a controlled access to the providers management.",
        "At the LRZ a customer of the E-Mail Service can, e.g., use the Intelligent Assistant to perform ping requests to the mail server.",
        "But also more complex requests could be possible, e.g., requests of a combination of SNMP variables. 4.5 Active Probing Active probing is useful for the provider to check his offered services.",
        "The aim is to identify and react to problems before a customer notices them.",
        "The probing can be done from a customer point of view or by testing the resources which are part of the services.",
        "It can also be useful to perform tests of subservices (own subservices or subservices offered by suppliers).",
        "Different schedules are possible to perform the active probing.",
        "The provider could select to test important services and resources in regular time intervals.",
        "Other tests could be initiated by a user who traverses the decision tree of the Intelligent Assistant including active tests.",
        "Another possibility for the use of active probing is a request from the event correlator, if the current correlation result needs to be improved.",
        "The results of active probing are reported via service or resource events to the event correlator (or if the test was demanded by the Intelligent Assistant the result is reported to it, too).",
        "While the events that are received from management tools and customers denote negative events (something does not work), the events from active probing should also contain positive events for a better discrimination. 4.6 Event Correlator The event correlation should not be performed by a single event correlator, but by using different steps.",
        "The reason for this are the different characteristics of the dependencies (see Fig. 1).",
        "On the resource level there are only relationships between resources (network topology, systems configuration).",
        "An example for this could be a switch linking separate LANs.",
        "If the switch is down, events are reported that other network components which are located behind the switch are also not reachable.",
        "When correlating these events it can be figured out that the switch is the likely error cause.",
        "At this stage, the integration of service events does not seem to be helpful.",
        "The result of this step is a list of resources which could be the problems root cause.",
        "The resource event correlator is used to perform this step.",
        "In the service-oriented scenario there are also service and resource dependencies.",
        "As next step in the event correlation process the service events should be correlated with each other using the service dependencies, because the service dependencies have no direct relationship to the resource level.",
        "The result of this step, which is performed by the service event correlator, is a list of services/subservices which could contain a failure in a resource.",
        "If, e.g., there are service events from customers that two services do not work and both services depend on a common subservice, it seems more likely that the resource failure can be found inside the subservice.",
        "The output of this correlation is a list of services/subservices which could be affected by a failure in an associated resource.",
        "In the last step the aggregate event correlator matches the lists from resource event correlator and service event correlator to find the problems possible root cause.",
        "This is done by using the resource dependencies.",
        "The event correlation techniques presented in Section 2 could be used to perform the correlation inside the three event correlators.",
        "If the dependencies can be found precisely, an RBR or codebook approach seems to be appropriate.",
        "A case database (CBR) could be used if there are cases which could not be covered by RBR or the codebook approach.",
        "These cases could then be used to improve the modeling in a way that RBR or the codebook approach can deal with them in future correlations. 5.",

        "It should also be possible to add an informal description of the problem.",
        "QoS parameters: For each service QoS parameters (Service View) are defined between the provider and the customer.",
        "This field represents a list of these QoS parameters and agreed service levels.",
        "The list can help the provider to set the priority of a problem with respect to the service levels agreed.",
        "Resource list: This list contains the resources (Realization View) which are needed to provide the service.",
        "This list is used by the provider to check if one of these resources causes the problem.",
        "Subservice service event identification: In the service hierarchy (Realization View) the service, for which this service event has been issued, may depend on subservices.",
        "If there is a suspicion that one of these subservices causes the problem, child service events are issued from this service event for the subservices.",
        "In such a case this field contains links to the corresponding events.",
        "Other event identifications: In the event correlation process the service event can be correlated with other service events or with resource events.",
        "This field then contains links to other events which have been correlated to this service event.",
        "This is useful to, e.g., send a common message to all affected customers when their subscribed services are available again.",
        "Issuers identification: This field can either contain an identification of the customer who reported the problem, an identification of a service providers employee 189 (in case the failure has been detected by the providers own service active probing) or a link to a parent service event.",
        "The identification is needed, if there are ambiguities in the service event or the issuer should be informed (e.g., that the service is available again).",
        "The possible issuers refer to the basic roles (customer, provider) in the Service Model.",
        "Assignee: To keep track of the processing the name and address of the providers employee who is solving or solved the problem is also noted.",

        "For, e.g., an unreachable web site different root causes are possible like a DNS problem, connectivity problem, wrong configuration of the load balancer. 6.2 Active Probing In general, active probing can be used for services or resources.",
        "For the service active probing of the Virtual WWW Server a virtual customer could be installed.",
        "This customer does typical HTTP requests of web sites and compares the answer with the known content.",

        "At first, a customer who takes a look at his hosted web site reports that the content that he had changed is not displayed correctly.",
        "This report is transferred to the service management via the CSM interface.",
        "An Intelligent Assistant could be used to structure the customer report.",
        "The service management translates the customer report into a service event.",
        "Independent from the customer report the service providers own service active probing tries to change the content of a test web site.",
        "Because this is not possible, a service event is issued.",
        "Meanwhile, a resource event has been reported to the event correlator, because an access of the content caching server to one of the WWW servers failed.",

        "At this stage it would be possible that the event correlator asks the resource management to perform an active probing of related resources.",
        "Both service events are now transferred to the service event correlator and are correlated.",
        "From the correlation of these events it seems likely that either the WWW server itself or the link to the WWW server is the problems root cause.",
        "A wrong web site update procedure inside the content caching server seems to be less likely as this would only explain the customer report and not the service active probing result.",
        "At this stage a service active probing could be started, but this does not seem to be useful as this correlation only deals with the Web Hosting Service and its resources and not with other services.",
        "After the separate correlation of both resource and service events, which can be performed in parallel, the aggregate event correlator is used to correlate both types of events.",
        "The additional resource event makes it seem much more likely that the problems are caused by a broken link to the WWW server or by the WWW server itself and not by the content caching server.",
        "In this case the event correlator asks the resource management to check the link and the WWW server.",
        "The decision between these two likely error causes can not be further automated here.",
        "Later, the resource management finds out that a broken link is the failures root cause.",
        "It informs the event correlator about this and it can be determined that this explains all previous events.",
        "Therefore, the event correlation can be stopped at this point.",

        "After the link has been repaired, it is possible to report this event via the CSM interface.",

        "If the LRZ E-Mail Service and its events are viewed in relationship with the events for the Virtual WWW Server, it is possible to identify failures in common subservices and resources.",
        "Both services depend on the DNS which means that customer reports like I cannot retrieve new e-mail and The web site of my research institute is not available can have a common cause, e.g., the DNS does not work properly. 7.",
        "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In our paper we showed the need for a service-oriented event correlation.",
        "For an IT service provider this new kind of event correlation makes it possible to automatically map problems with the current service quality onto resource failures.",
        "This helps to find the failures root cause earlier and to reduce costs for SLA violations.",
        "In addition, customer reports can be linked together and therefore the processing effort can be reduced.",
        "To receive these benefits we presented our approach for performing the service-oriented event correlation as well as a modeling of the necessary correlation information.",
        "In the future we are going to apply our workflow and information modeling for services offered by the Leibniz Supercomputing Center going further into details.",
        "Several issues have not been treated in detail so far, e.g., the consequences for the service-oriented event correlation if a subservice is offered by another provider.",
        "If a service does not perform properly, it has to be determined whether this is caused by the provider himself or by the subservice.",
        "In the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the CSM interface.",
        "Another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay.",
        "Another important point is the precise definition of dependency which has also been left out by many other publications.",
        "To avoid having to much dependencies in a certain situation one could try to check whether the dependencies currently exist.",
        "In case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the DNS subservice at the beginning, but after the address is resolved a download failure is unlikely to have been caused by the DNS.",
        "Another possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service into its possible user interactions (e.g., an e-mail service into transactions like get mail, sent mail, etc) and to define the dependencies for each user interaction.",

                "In addition, customer reports can be linked together and therefore the processing effort can be reduced.",
                "To receive these benefits we presented our approach for performing the <br>service-oriented event correlation</br> as well as a modeling of the necessary correlation information.",
                "In the future we are going to apply our workflow and information modeling for services offered by the Leibniz Supercomputing Center going further into details.",
                "Several issues have not been treated in detail so far, e.g., the consequences for the <br>service-oriented event correlation</br> if a subservice is offered by another provider.",
                "If a service does not perform properly, it has to be determined whether this is caused by the provider himself or by the subservice.",
                "In the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the CSM interface.",
                "Another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay.",
                "Another important point is the precise definition of dependency which has also been left out by many other publications.",
                "To avoid having to much dependencies in a certain situation one could try to check whether the dependencies currently exist.",
                "In case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the DNS subservice at the beginning, but after the address is resolved a download failure is unlikely to have been caused by the DNS.",
                "Another possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service into its possible user interactions (e.g., an e-mail service into transactions like get mail, sent mail, etc) and to define the dependencies for each user interaction.",

                "Functional aspect: The correlation focuses on functions which are provided by each network element.",
                "It is also regarded which other functions are used to provide a specific function.",
                "Topology aspect: The correlation takes into account how the network elements are connected to each other and how they interact.",
                "Time aspect: When explicitly regarding time constraints, a start and end time has to be defined for each event.",
                "The correlation can use time relationships between the events to perform the correlation.",
                "This aspect is only mentioned in some papers [11], but it has to be treated in an event correlation system.",
                "In the event correlation it is also important to distinguish between the knowledge acquisition/representation and the correlation algorithm.",
                "Examples of approaches to knowledge acquisition/representation are Gruschkes dependency graphs [6] and Ensels dependency detection by neural networks [3].",
                "It is also possible to find the dependencies by analyzing interactions [7].",

                "A model can either represent a physical entity or a logical entity (e.g., LAN, WAN, domain, service, business process).",
                "The models for physical entities are called functional model, while the models for all logical entities are called logical model.",
                "A description of each model contains three categories of information: attributes, relations to other models, and behavior.",
                "The event correlation is a result of the collaboration among models.",
                "As all components of a network are represented with their behavior in the model, it is possible to perform simulations to predict how the whole network will behave.",
                "A comparison in [20] showed that a large MBR system is not in all cases easy to maintain.",
                "It can be difficult to appropriately model the behavior for all components and their interactions correctly and completely.",
                "An example system for MBR is NetExpert[16] from OSI which is a hybrid MBR/RBR system (in 2000 OSI was acquired by Agilent Technologies).",
                "Rule-based reasoning: Rule-based reasoning (RBR) [15, 10] uses a set of rules for event correlation.",
                "The rules have the form conclusion if condition.",
                "The condition uses received events and information about the system, while the conclusion contains actions which can either lead to system changes or use system parameters to choose the next rule.",
                "An advantage of the approach is that the rules are more or less human-readable and therefore their effect is intuitive.",
                "The correlation has proved to be very fast in practice by using the RETE algorithm.",
                "In the literature [20, 1] it is claimed that RBR systems are classified as relatively inflexible.",
                "Frequent changes in the modeled IT environment would lead to many rule updates.",
                "These changes would have to be performed by experts as no automation has currently been established.",
                "In some systems information about the network topology which is needed for the event correlation is not used explicitly, but is encoded into the rules.",
                "This intransparent usage would make rule updates for topology changes quite difficult.",
                "The system brittleness would also be a problem for RBR systems.",
                "It means that the system fails if an unknown case occurs, because the case cannot be mapped onto similar cases.",
                "The output of RBR systems would also be difficult to predict, because of unforeseen rule interactions in a large rule set.",
                "According to [15] an RBR system is only appropriate if the domain for which it is used is small, nonchanging, and well understood.",

                "It also uses MBR (GTE has merged with Bell Atlantic in 1998 and is now called Verizon [19]).",
                "Codebook approach: The codebook approach [12, 21] has similarities to RBR, but takes a further step and encodes the rules into a correlation matrix.",
                "The approach starts using a dependency graph with two kinds of nodes for the modeling.",
                "The first kind of nodes are the faults (denoted as problems in the cited papers) which have to be detected, while the second kind of nodes are observable events (symptoms in the papers) which are caused by the faults or other events.",
                "The dependencies between the nodes are denoted as directed edges.",
                "It is possible to choose weights for the edges, e.g., a weight for the probability that 184 fault/event A causes event B.",
                "Another possible weighting could indicate time dependencies.",
                "There are several possibilities to reduce the initial graph.",
                "If, e.g., a cyclic dependency of events exists and there are no probabilities for the cycles edges, all events can be treated as one event.",
                "After a final input graph is chosen, the graph is transformed into a correlation matrix where the columns contain the faults and the rows contain the events.",
                "If there is a dependency in the graph, the weight of the corresponding edge is put into the according matrix cell.",
                "In case no weights are used, the matrix cells get the values 1 for dependency and 0 otherwise.",
                "Afterwards, a simplification can be done, where events which do not help to discriminate faults are deleted.",
                "There is a trade-off between the minimization of the matrix and the robustness of the results.",
                "If the matrix is minimized as much as possible, some faults can only be distinguished by a single event.",
                "If this event cannot be reliably detected, the event correlation system cannot discriminate between the two faults.",
                "A measure how many event observation errors can be compensated by the system is the Hamming distance.",
                "The number of rows (events) that can be deleted from the matrix can differ very much depending on the relationships [15].",
                "The codebook approach has the advantage that it uses long-term experience with graphs and coding.",
                "This experience is used to minimize the dependency graph and to select an optimal group of events with respect to processing time and robustness against noise.",
                "A disadvantage of the approach could be that similar to RBR frequent changes in the environment make it necessary to frequently edit the input graph.",
                "SMARTS InCharge [12, 17] is an example of such a correlation system.",
                "Case-based reasoning: In contrast to other approaches case-based reasoning (CBR) [14, 15] systems do not use any knowledge about the system structure.",

                "The recovery actions are not performed by the CBR system in the first place, but in most cases by a human operator.",
                "If a new case appears, the CBR system compares the current system parameters with the system parameters in prior cases and tries to find a similar one.",
                "To identify such a match it has to be defined for which parameters the cases can differ or have to be the same.",
                "If a match is found, a learned action can be performed automatically or the operator can be informed with a recovery proposal.",
                "An advantage of this approach is that the ability to learn is an integral part of it which is important for rapid changing environments.",
                "There are also difficulties when applying the approach [15].",
                "The fields which are used to find a similar case and their importance have to be defined appropriately.",
                "If there is a match with a similar case, an adaptation of the previous solution to the current one has to be found.",

                "In case of the services mentioned above such subservices are DNS, proxy service, and IP service.",
                "Both services and subservices depend on resources upon which they are provisioned.",

                "Service event: A service event indicates that a service does not work properly.",
                "A trouble ticket which is generated from a customer report is a kind of such an 185 event.",
                "Other service events can be generated by the provider of a service, if the provider himself detects a service malfunction.",
                "In such a scenario the provider may receive service events from customers which indicate that SSH, web hosting service, and video conference service are not available.",
                "When referring to the service hierarchy, the provider can conclude in such a case that all services depend on DNS.",
                "Therefore, it seems more likely that a common resource which is necessary for this service does not work properly or is not available than to assume three independent service failures.",
                "In contrast to a resource-oriented perspective where all of the service events would have to be processed separately, the service events can be linked together.",
                "Their information can be aggregated and processed only once.",
                "If, e.g., the problem is solved, one common message to the customers that their services are available again is generated and distributed by using the list of linked service events.",
                "This is certainly a simplified example.",
                "However, it shows the general principle of identifying the common subservices and common resources of different services.",
                "It is important to note that the service-oriented perspective is needed to integrate service aspects, especially QoS aspects.",
                "An example of such an aspect is that a fault does not lead to a total failure of a service, but its QoS parameters, respectively agreed service levels, at the customer-provider interface might not be met.",
                "A degradation in service quality which is caused by high traffic load on the backbone is another example.",
                "In the resource-oriented perspective it would be possible to define events which indicate that there is a link usage higher than a threshold, but no mechanism has currently been established to find out which services are affected and whether a QoS violation occurs.",
                "To summarize, the reasons for the necessity of a serviceoriented event correlation are the following: Keeping of SLAs (top-down perspective): The time interval between the first symptom (recognized either by provider, network management tools, or customers) that a service does not perform properly and the verified fault repair needs to be minimized.",
                "This is especially needed with respect to SLAs as such agreements often contain guarantees like a mean time to repair.",
                "Effort reduction (top-down perspective): If several user trouble reports are symptoms of the same fault, fault processing should be performed only once and not several times.",

                "Impact analysis (bottom-up perspective): In case of a fault in a resource, its influence on the associated services and affected customers can be determined.",

                "In addition to these two passive ways to get the events, a provider can also perform active tests.",
                "These tests can either deal with the resources (resource active probing) or can assume the role of a virtual customer and test a service or one of its subservices by performing interactions at the service access points (service active probing).",
                "The fault diagnosis phase is composed of three event correlation steps.",
                "The first one is performed by the resource event correlator which can be regarded as the event correlator in todays commercial systems.",
                "Therefore, it deals only with resource events.",

                "But also more complex requests could be possible, e.g., requests of a combination of SNMP variables. 4.5 Active Probing Active probing is useful for the provider to check his offered services.",
                "The aim is to identify and react to problems before a customer notices them.",
                "The probing can be done from a customer point of view or by testing the resources which are part of the services.",
                "It can also be useful to perform tests of subservices (own subservices or subservices offered by suppliers).",
                "Different schedules are possible to perform the active probing.",

                "While the events that are received from management tools and customers denote negative events (something does not work), the events from active probing should also contain positive events for a better discrimination. 4.6 Event Correlator The event correlation should not be performed by a single event correlator, but by using different steps.",
                "The reason for this are the different characteristics of the dependencies (see Fig. 1).",
                "On the resource level there are only relationships between resources (network topology, systems configuration).",

                "If the switch is down, events are reported that other network components which are located behind the switch are also not reachable.",
                "When correlating these events it can be figured out that the switch is the likely error cause.",
                "At this stage, the integration of service events does not seem to be helpful.",
                "The result of this step is a list of resources which could be the problems root cause.",
                "The resource event correlator is used to perform this step.",
                "In the service-oriented scenario there are also service and resource dependencies.",
                "As next step in the event correlation process the service events should be correlated with each other using the service dependencies, because the service dependencies have no direct relationship to the resource level.",
                "The result of this step, which is performed by the service event correlator, is a list of services/subservices which could contain a failure in a resource.",
                "If, e.g., there are service events from customers that two services do not work and both services depend on a common subservice, it seems more likely that the resource failure can be found inside the subservice.",
                "The output of this correlation is a list of services/subservices which could be affected by a failure in an associated resource.",
                "In the last step the aggregate event correlator matches the lists from resource event correlator and service event correlator to find the problems possible root cause.",
                "This is done by using the resource dependencies.",
                "The event correlation techniques presented in Section 2 could be used to perform the correlation inside the three event correlators.",
                "If the dependencies can be found precisely, an RBR or codebook approach seems to be appropriate.",
                "A case database (CBR) could be used if there are cases which could not be covered by RBR or the codebook approach.",
                "These cases could then be used to improve the modeling in a way that RBR or the codebook approach can deal with them in future correlations. 5.",

                "In the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the CSM interface.",
                "Another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay.",

                "The approach starts using a dependency graph with two kinds of nodes for the modeling.",
                "The first kind of nodes are the faults (denoted as problems in the cited papers) which have to be detected, while the second kind of nodes are observable events (symptoms in the papers) which are caused by the faults or other events.",
                "The dependencies between the nodes are denoted as directed edges.",

                "The reason for this are the different characteristics of the dependencies (see Fig. 1).",
                "On the resource level there are only relationships between resources (network topology, systems configuration).",

                "As next step in the event correlation process the service events should be correlated with each other using the service dependencies, because the service dependencies have no direct relationship to the resource level.",
                "The result of this step, which is performed by the service event correlator, is a list of services/subservices which could contain a failure in a resource.",
                "If, e.g., there are service events from customers that two services do not work and both services depend on a common subservice, it seems more likely that the resource failure can be found inside the subservice.",

                "Several issues have not been treated in detail so far, e.g., the consequences for the service-oriented event correlation if a subservice is offered by another provider.",
                "If a service does not perform properly, it has to be determined whether this is caused by the provider himself or by the subservice.",
                "In the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the CSM interface.",
                "Another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay.",
                "Another important point is the precise definition of dependency which has also been left out by many other publications.",
                "To avoid having to much dependencies in a certain situation one could try to check whether the dependencies currently exist.",
                "In case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the DNS subservice at the beginning, but after the address is resolved a download failure is unlikely to have been caused by the DNS.",
                "Another possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service into its possible user interactions (e.g., an e-mail service into transactions like get mail, sent mail, etc) and to define the dependencies for each user interaction.",

                "If a service does not perform properly, it has to be determined whether this is caused by the provider himself or by the subservice.",
                "In the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the CSM interface.",
                "Another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay.",
                "Another important point is the precise definition of dependency which has also been left out by many other publications.",
                "To avoid having to much dependencies in a certain situation one could try to check whether the dependencies currently exist.",
                "In case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the DNS subservice at the beginning, but after the address is resolved a download failure is unlikely to have been caused by the DNS.",
                "Another possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service into its possible user interactions (e.g., an e-mail service into transactions like get mail, sent mail, etc) and to define the dependencies for each user interaction.",

                "Functional aspect: The correlation focuses on functions which are provided by each network element.",
                "It is also regarded which other functions are used to provide a specific function.",
                "Topology aspect: The correlation takes into account how the network elements are connected to each other and how they interact.",
                "Time aspect: When explicitly regarding time constraints, a start and end time has to be defined for each event.",
                "The correlation can use time relationships between the events to perform the correlation.",
                "This aspect is only mentioned in some papers [11], but it has to be treated in an event correlation system.",
                "In the event correlation it is also important to distinguish between the knowledge acquisition/representation and the correlation algorithm.",
                "Examples of approaches to knowledge acquisition/representation are Gruschkes dependency graphs [6] and Ensels dependency detection by neural networks [3].",
                "It is also possible to find the dependencies by analyzing interactions [7].",
                "In addition, there is an approach to manage service dependencies with XML and to define a resource description framework [4].",
                "To get an overview about device-oriented event correlation a selection of several event correlation techniques being used for this kind of correlation is presented.",
                "Model-based reasoning: Model-based reasoning (MBR) [15, 10, 20] represents a system by modeling each of its components.",
                "A model can either represent a physical entity or a logical entity (e.g., LAN, WAN, domain, service, business process).",
                "The models for physical entities are called functional model, while the models for all logical entities are called logical model.",
                "A description of each model contains three categories of information: attributes, relations to other models, and behavior.",
                "The event correlation is a result of the collaboration among models.",
                "As all components of a network are represented with their behavior in the model, it is possible to perform simulations to predict how the whole network will behave.",
                "A comparison in [20] showed that a large MBR system is not in all cases easy to maintain.",
                "It can be difficult to appropriately model the behavior for all components and their interactions correctly and completely.",
                "An example system for MBR is NetExpert[16] from OSI which is a hybrid MBR/RBR system (in 2000 OSI was acquired by Agilent Technologies).",
                "Rule-based reasoning: Rule-based reasoning (RBR) [15, 10] uses a set of rules for event correlation.",
                "The rules have the form conclusion if condition.",
                "The condition uses received events and information about the system, while the conclusion contains actions which can either lead to system changes or use system parameters to choose the next rule.",
                "An advantage of the approach is that the rules are more or less human-readable and therefore their effect is intuitive.",
                "The correlation has proved to be very fast in practice by using the RETE algorithm.",
                "In the literature [20, 1] it is claimed that RBR systems are classified as relatively inflexible.",
                "Frequent changes in the modeled IT environment would lead to many rule updates.",
                "These changes would have to be performed by experts as no automation has currently been established.",
                "In some systems information about the network topology which is needed for the event correlation is not used explicitly, but is encoded into the rules.",
                "This intransparent usage would make rule updates for topology changes quite difficult.",
                "The system brittleness would also be a problem for RBR systems.",
                "It means that the system fails if an unknown case occurs, because the case cannot be mapped onto similar cases.",
                "The output of RBR systems would also be difficult to predict, because of unforeseen rule interactions in a large rule set.",
                "According to [15] an RBR system is only appropriate if the domain for which it is used is small, nonchanging, and well understood.",
                "The GTE IMPACT system [11] is an example of a rulebased system.",
                "It also uses MBR (GTE has merged with Bell Atlantic in 1998 and is now called Verizon [19]).",
                "Codebook approach: The codebook approach [12, 21] has similarities to RBR, but takes a further step and encodes the rules into a correlation matrix.",
                "The approach starts using a dependency graph with two kinds of nodes for the modeling.",
                "The first kind of nodes are the faults (denoted as problems in the cited papers) which have to be detected, while the second kind of nodes are observable events (symptoms in the papers) which are caused by the faults or other events.",
                "The dependencies between the nodes are denoted as directed edges.",
                "It is possible to choose weights for the edges, e.g., a weight for the probability that 184 fault/event A causes event B.",
                "Another possible weighting could indicate time dependencies.",
                "There are several possibilities to reduce the initial graph.",
                "If, e.g., a cyclic dependency of events exists and there are no probabilities for the cycles edges, all events can be treated as one event.",
                "After a final input graph is chosen, the graph is transformed into a correlation matrix where the columns contain the faults and the rows contain the events.",
                "If there is a dependency in the graph, the weight of the corresponding edge is put into the according matrix cell.",
                "In case no weights are used, the matrix cells get the values 1 for dependency and 0 otherwise.",
                "Afterwards, a simplification can be done, where events which do not help to discriminate faults are deleted.",
                "There is a trade-off between the minimization of the matrix and the robustness of the results.",
                "If the matrix is minimized as much as possible, some faults can only be distinguished by a single event.",
                "If this event cannot be reliably detected, the event correlation system cannot discriminate between the two faults.",
                "A measure how many event observation errors can be compensated by the system is the Hamming distance.",
                "The number of rows (events) that can be deleted from the matrix can differ very much depending on the relationships [15].",
                "The codebook approach has the advantage that it uses long-term experience with graphs and coding.",
                "This experience is used to minimize the dependency graph and to select an optimal group of events with respect to processing time and robustness against noise.",
                "A disadvantage of the approach could be that similar to RBR frequent changes in the environment make it necessary to frequently edit the input graph.",
                "SMARTS InCharge [12, 17] is an example of such a correlation system.",
                "Case-based reasoning: In contrast to other approaches case-based reasoning (CBR) [14, 15] systems do not use any knowledge about the system structure.",
                "The knowledge base saves cases with their values for system parameters and successful recovery actions for these cases.",
                "The recovery actions are not performed by the CBR system in the first place, but in most cases by a human operator.",
                "If a new case appears, the CBR system compares the current system parameters with the system parameters in prior cases and tries to find a similar one.",
                "To identify such a match it has to be defined for which parameters the cases can differ or have to be the same.",
                "If a match is found, a learned action can be performed automatically or the operator can be informed with a recovery proposal.",
                "An advantage of this approach is that the ability to learn is an integral part of it which is important for rapid changing environments.",
                "There are also difficulties when applying the approach [15].",
                "The fields which are used to find a similar case and their importance have to be defined appropriately.",
                "If there is a match with a similar case, an adaptation of the previous solution to the current one has to be found.",
                "An example system for CBR is SpectroRx from Cabletron Systems.",
                "The part of Cabletron that developed SpectroRx became an independent software company in 2002 and is now called Aprisma Management Technologies [2].",
                "In this section four event correlation approaches were presented which have evolved into commercial event correlation systems.",
                "The correlation approaches have different focuses.",

                "A trouble ticket which is generated from a customer report is a kind of such an 185 event.",
                "Other service events can be generated by the provider of a service, if the provider himself detects a service malfunction.",
                "In such a scenario the provider may receive service events from customers which indicate that SSH, web hosting service, and video conference service are not available.",
                "When referring to the service hierarchy, the provider can conclude in such a case that all services depend on DNS.",
                "Therefore, it seems more likely that a common resource which is necessary for this service does not work properly or is not available than to assume three independent service failures.",
                "In contrast to a resource-oriented perspective where all of the service events would have to be processed separately, the service events can be linked together.",
                "Their information can be aggregated and processed only once.",
                "If, e.g., the problem is solved, one common message to the customers that their services are available again is generated and distributed by using the list of linked service events.",
                "This is certainly a simplified example.",
                "However, it shows the general principle of identifying the common subservices and common resources of different services.",
                "It is important to note that the service-oriented perspective is needed to integrate service aspects, especially <br>qos</br> aspects.",
                "An example of such an aspect is that a fault does not lead to a total failure of a service, but its <br>qos</br> parameters, respectively agreed service levels, at the customer-provider interface might not be met.",
                "A degradation in service quality which is caused by high traffic load on the backbone is another example.",
                "In the resource-oriented perspective it would be possible to define events which indicate that there is a link usage higher than a threshold, but no mechanism has currently been established to find out which services are affected and whether a <br>qos</br> violation occurs.",
                "To summarize, the reasons for the necessity of a serviceoriented event correlation are the following: Keeping of SLAs (top-down perspective): The time interval between the first symptom (recognized either by provider, network management tools, or customers) that a service does not perform properly and the verified fault repair needs to be minimized.",
                "This is especially needed with respect to SLAs as such agreements often contain guarantees like a mean time to repair.",
                "Effort reduction (top-down perspective): If several user trouble reports are symptoms of the same fault, fault processing should be performed only once and not several times.",

                "In the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the CSM interface.",
                "Another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay.",
                "Another important point is the precise definition of dependency which has also been left out by many other publications.",
                "To avoid having to much dependencies in a certain situation one could try to check whether the dependencies currently exist.",
                "In case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the DNS subservice at the beginning, but after the address is resolved a download failure is unlikely to have been caused by the DNS.",
                "Another possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service into its possible user interactions (e.g., an e-mail service into transactions like get mail, sent mail, etc) and to define the dependencies for each user interaction.",

                "Topology aspect: The correlation takes into account how the network elements are connected to each other and how they interact.",
                "Time aspect: When explicitly regarding time constraints, a start and end time has to be defined for each event.",
                "The correlation can use time relationships between the events to perform the correlation.",
                "This aspect is only mentioned in some papers [11], but it has to be treated in an event correlation system.",
                "In the event correlation it is also important to distinguish between the knowledge acquisition/representation and the correlation algorithm.",
                "Examples of approaches to knowledge acquisition/representation are Gruschkes dependency graphs [6] and Ensels dependency detection by neural networks [3].",

                "Rule-based reasoning: Rule-based reasoning (RBR) [15, 10] uses a set of rules for event correlation.",
                "The rules have the form conclusion if condition.",
                "The condition uses received events and information about the system, while the conclusion contains actions which can either lead to system changes or use system parameters to choose the next rule.",
                "An advantage of the approach is that the rules are more or less human-readable and therefore their effect is intuitive.",
                "The correlation has proved to be very fast in practice by using the RETE algorithm.",
                "In the literature [20, 1] it is claimed that RBR systems are classified as relatively inflexible.",
                "Frequent changes in the modeled IT environment would lead to many rule updates.",
                "These changes would have to be performed by experts as no automation has currently been established.",
                "In some systems information about the network topology which is needed for the event correlation is not used explicitly, but is encoded into the rules.",
                "This intransparent usage would make rule updates for topology changes quite difficult.",
                "The system brittleness would also be a problem for RBR systems.",
                "It means that the system fails if an unknown case occurs, because the case cannot be mapped onto similar cases.",
                "The output of RBR systems would also be difficult to predict, because of unforeseen rule interactions in a large rule set.",
                "According to [15] an RBR system is only appropriate if the domain for which it is used is small, nonchanging, and well understood.",

                "Codebook approach: The codebook approach [12, 21] has similarities to RBR, but takes a further step and encodes the rules into a correlation matrix.",
                "The approach starts using a dependency graph with two kinds of nodes for the modeling.",
                "The first kind of nodes are the faults (denoted as problems in the cited papers) which have to be detected, while the second kind of nodes are observable events (symptoms in the papers) which are caused by the faults or other events.",
                "The dependencies between the nodes are denoted as directed edges.",
                "It is possible to choose weights for the edges, e.g., a weight for the probability that 184 fault/event A causes event B.",
                "Another possible weighting could indicate time dependencies.",
                "There are several possibilities to reduce the initial graph.",

                "After a final input graph is chosen, the graph is transformed into a correlation matrix where the columns contain the faults and the rows contain the events.",
                "If there is a dependency in the graph, the weight of the corresponding edge is put into the according matrix cell.",
                "In case no weights are used, the matrix cells get the values 1 for dependency and 0 otherwise.",
                "Afterwards, a simplification can be done, where events which do not help to discriminate faults are deleted.",
                "There is a trade-off between the minimization of the matrix and the robustness of the results.",
                "If the matrix is minimized as much as possible, some faults can only be distinguished by a single event.",
                "If this event cannot be reliably detected, the event correlation system cannot discriminate between the two faults.",
                "A measure how many event observation errors can be compensated by the system is the Hamming distance.",
                "The number of rows (events) that can be deleted from the matrix can differ very much depending on the relationships [15].",
                "The codebook approach has the advantage that it uses long-term experience with graphs and coding.",
                "This experience is used to minimize the dependency graph and to select an optimal group of events with respect to processing time and robustness against noise.",
                "A disadvantage of the approach could be that similar to RBR frequent changes in the environment make it necessary to frequently edit the input graph.",
                "SMARTS InCharge [12, 17] is an example of such a correlation system.",

                "The recovery actions are not performed by the CBR system in the first place, but in most cases by a human operator.",
                "If a new case appears, the CBR system compares the current system parameters with the system parameters in prior cases and tries to find a similar one.",
                "To identify such a match it has to be defined for which parameters the cases can differ or have to be the same.",
                "If a match is found, a learned action can be performed automatically or the operator can be informed with a recovery proposal.",
                "An advantage of this approach is that the ability to learn is an integral part of it which is important for rapid changing environments.",
                "There are also difficulties when applying the approach [15].",
                "The fields which are used to find a similar case and their importance have to be defined appropriately.",
                "If there is a match with a similar case, an adaptation of the previous solution to the current one has to be found.",

                "Other service events can be generated by the provider of a service, if the provider himself detects a service malfunction.",
                "In such a scenario the provider may receive service events from customers which indicate that SSH, web hosting service, and video conference service are not available.",
                "When referring to the service hierarchy, the provider can conclude in such a case that all services depend on DNS.",
                "Therefore, it seems more likely that a common resource which is necessary for this service does not work properly or is not available than to assume three independent service failures.",

                "If, e.g., the problem is solved, one common message to the customers that their services are available again is generated and distributed by using the list of linked service events.",
                "This is certainly a simplified example.",
                "However, it shows the general principle of identifying the common subservices and common resources of different services.",
                "It is important to note that the service-oriented perspective is needed to integrate service aspects, especially QoS aspects.",
                "An example of such an aspect is that a fault does not lead to a total failure of a service, but its QoS parameters, respectively agreed service levels, at the customer-provider interface might not be met.",
                "A degradation in service quality which is caused by high traffic load on the backbone is another example.",
                "In the resource-oriented perspective it would be possible to define events which indicate that there is a link usage higher than a threshold, but no mechanism has currently been established to find out which services are affected and whether a QoS violation occurs.",
                "To summarize, the reasons for the necessity of a serviceoriented event correlation are the following: Keeping of SLAs (top-down perspective): The time interval between the first symptom (recognized either by provider, network management tools, or customers) that a service does not perform properly and the verified fault repair needs to be minimized.",
                "This is especially needed with respect to SLAs as such agreements often contain guarantees like a mean time to repair.",

                "The aim is to identify and react to problems before a customer notices them.",
                "The probing can be done from a customer point of view or by testing the resources which are part of the services.",

                "In the service-oriented scenario there are also service and resource dependencies.",
                "As next step in the event correlation process the service events should be correlated with each other using the service dependencies, because the service dependencies have no direct relationship to the resource level.",
                "The result of this step, which is performed by the service event correlator, is a list of services/subservices which could contain a failure in a resource.",
                "If, e.g., there are service events from customers that two services do not work and both services depend on a common subservice, it seems more likely that the resource failure can be found inside the subservice.",
                "The output of this correlation is a list of services/subservices which could be affected by a failure in an associated resource.",
                "In the last step the aggregate event correlator matches the lists from resource event correlator and service event correlator to find the problems possible root cause.",

                "The event correlation techniques presented in Section 2 could be used to perform the correlation inside the three event correlators.",
                "If the dependencies can be found precisely, an RBR or codebook approach seems to be appropriate.",
                "A case database (CBR) could be used if there are cases which could not be covered by RBR or the codebook approach.",

                "For an IT service provider this new kind of event correlation makes it possible to automatically map problems with the current service quality onto resource failures.",
                "This helps to find the failures root cause earlier and to reduce costs for SLA violations.",

                "To receive these benefits we presented our approach for performing the service-oriented event correlation as well as a modeling of the necessary correlation information.",
                "In the future we are going to apply our workflow and information modeling for services offered by the Leibniz Supercomputing Center going further into details.",
                "Several issues have not been treated in detail so far, e.g., the consequences for the service-oriented event correlation if a subservice is offered by another provider.",
                "If a service does not perform properly, it has to be determined whether this is caused by the provider himself or by the subservice.",
                "In the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the CSM interface.",
                "Another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay.",
                "Another important point is the precise definition of dependency which has also been left out by many other publications.",
                "To avoid having to much dependencies in a certain situation one could try to check whether the dependencies currently exist.",
                "In case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the DNS subservice at the beginning, but after the address is resolved a download failure is unlikely to have been caused by the DNS.",
                "Another possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service into its possible user interactions (e.g., an e-mail service into transactions like get mail, sent mail, etc) and to define the dependencies for each user interaction.",

                "For an IT service provider this new kind of event correlation makes it possible to automatically map problems with the current service quality onto resource failures.",
                "This helps to find the failures root cause earlier and to reduce costs for SLA violations.",
                "In addition, customer reports can be linked together and therefore the processing effort can be reduced.",
                "To receive these benefits we presented our approach for performing the service-oriented event correlation as well as a modeling of the necessary correlation information.",
                "In the future we are going to apply our workflow and information modeling for services offered by the Leibniz Supercomputing Center going further into details.",
                "Several issues have not been treated in detail so far, e.g., the consequences for the service-oriented event correlation if a subservice is offered by another provider.",
                "If a service does not perform properly, it has to be determined whether this is caused by the provider himself or by the subservice.",
                "In the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the CSM interface.",
                "Another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay.",
                "Another important point is the precise definition of dependency which has also been left out by many other publications.",
                "To avoid having to much dependencies in a certain situation one could try to check whether the dependencies currently exist.",
                "In case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the DNS subservice at the beginning, but after the address is resolved a download failure is unlikely to have been caused by the DNS.",
                "Another possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service into its possible user interactions (e.g., an e-mail service into transactions like get mail, sent mail, etc) and to define the dependencies for each user interaction.",

                "In the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the CSM interface.",
                "Another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay.",
                "Another important point is the precise definition of dependency which has also been left out by many other publications.",
                "To avoid having to much dependencies in a certain situation one could try to check whether the dependencies currently exist.",
                "In case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the DNS subservice at the beginning, but after the address is resolved a download failure is unlikely to have been caused by the DNS.",
                "Another possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service into its possible user interactions (e.g., an e-mail service into transactions like get mail, sent mail, etc) and to define the dependencies for each user interaction.",

                "In the literature [20, 1] it is claimed that RBR systems are classified as relatively inflexible.",
                "Frequent changes in the modeled IT environment would lead to many rule updates.",
                "These changes would have to be performed by experts as no automation has currently been established.",
                "In some systems information about the network topology which is needed for the event correlation is not used explicitly, but is encoded into the rules.",
                "This intransparent usage would make rule updates for topology changes quite difficult.",
                "The system brittleness would also be a problem for RBR systems.",

                "The approach starts using a dependency graph with two kinds of nodes for the modeling.",
                "The first kind of nodes are the faults (denoted as problems in the cited papers) which have to be detected, while the second kind of nodes are observable events (symptoms in the papers) which are caused by the faults or other events.",
                "The dependencies between the nodes are denoted as directed edges.",
                "It is possible to choose weights for the edges, e.g., a weight for the probability that 184 fault/event A causes event B.",

                "If there is a dependency in the graph, the weight of the corresponding edge is put into the according matrix cell.",
                "In case no weights are used, the matrix cells get the values 1 for dependency and 0 otherwise.",

                "The codebook approach has the advantage that it uses long-term experience with graphs and coding.",
                "This experience is used to minimize the dependency graph and to select an optimal group of events with respect to processing time and robustness against noise.",
                "A disadvantage of the approach could be that similar to RBR frequent changes in the environment make it necessary to frequently edit the input graph.",

                "The recovery actions are not performed by the CBR system in the first place, but in most cases by a human operator.",
                "If a new case appears, the CBR system compares the current system parameters with the system parameters in prior cases and tries to find a similar one.",
                "To identify such a match it has to be defined for which parameters the cases can differ or have to be the same.",
                "If a match is found, a learned action can be performed automatically or the operator can be informed with a recovery proposal.",
                "An advantage of this approach is that the ability to learn is an integral part of it which is important for rapid changing environments.",
                "There are also difficulties when applying the approach [15].",
                "The fields which are used to find a similar case and their importance have to be defined appropriately.",

                "Service event: A service event indicates that a service does not work properly.",
                "A trouble ticket which is generated from a customer report is a kind of such an 185 event.",
                "Other service events can be generated by the provider of a service, if the provider himself detects a service malfunction.",
                "In such a scenario the provider may receive service events from customers which indicate that SSH, web hosting service, and video conference service are not available.",
                "When referring to the service hierarchy, the provider can conclude in such a case that all services depend on DNS.",
                "Therefore, it seems more likely that a common resource which is necessary for this service does not work properly or is not available than to assume three independent service failures.",
                "In contrast to a resource-oriented perspective where all of the service events would have to be processed separately, the service events can be linked together.",
                "Their information can be aggregated and processed only once.",
                "If, e.g., the problem is solved, one common message to the customers that their services are available again is generated and distributed by using the list of linked service events.",
                "This is certainly a simplified example.",
                "However, it shows the general principle of identifying the common subservices and common resources of different services.",
                "It is important to note that the service-oriented perspective is needed to integrate service aspects, especially QoS aspects.",
                "An example of such an aspect is that a fault does not lead to a total failure of a service, but its QoS parameters, respectively agreed service levels, at the customer-provider interface might not be met.",
                "A degradation in service quality which is caused by high traffic load on the backbone is another example.",
                "In the resource-oriented perspective it would be possible to define events which indicate that there is a link usage higher than a threshold, but no mechanism has currently been established to find out which services are affected and whether a QoS violation occurs.",
                "To summarize, the reasons for the necessity of a serviceoriented event correlation are the following: Keeping of SLAs (top-down perspective): The time interval between the first symptom (recognized either by provider, network management tools, or customers) that a service does not perform properly and the verified fault repair needs to be minimized.",
                "This is especially needed with respect to SLAs as such agreements often contain guarantees like a mean time to repair.",
                "Effort reduction (top-down perspective): If several user trouble reports are symptoms of the same fault, fault processing should be performed only once and not several times.",
                "If the fault has been repaired, the affected customers should be informed about this automatically.",
                "Impact analysis (bottom-up perspective): In case of a fault in a resource, its influence on the associated services and affected customers can be determined.",

                "The resource events are issued during the use of a resource, e.g., via SNMP traps.",
                "The service events are originated from customer trouble reports, which are reported via the Customer Service Management (see below) access point.",
                "In addition to these two passive ways to get the events, a provider can also perform active tests.",
                "These tests can either deal with the resources (resource active probing) or can assume the role of a virtual customer and test a service or one of its subservices by performing interactions at the service access points (service active probing).",
                "The fault diagnosis phase is composed of three event correlation steps.",
                "The first one is performed by the resource event correlator which can be regarded as the event correlator in todays commercial systems.",

                "The CSM is also contained in the MNM Service Model (see Section 5).",
                "To reduce the effort for the providers first level support, an Intelligent Assistant can be added to the CSM.",

                "The information which is needed for a preclassification of the problem is gathered from a list of questions to the customer.",

                "A decision tree is used to structure the questions and tests.",
                "The tests allow the customer to gain a controlled access to the providers management.",
                "At the LRZ a customer of the E-Mail Service can, e.g., use the Intelligent Assistant to perform ping requests to the mail server.",
                "But also more complex requests could be possible, e.g., requests of a combination of SNMP variables. 4.5 Active Probing Active probing is useful for the provider to check his offered services.",
                "The aim is to identify and react to problems before a customer notices them.",
                "The probing can be done from a customer point of view or by testing the resources which are part of the services.",
                "It can also be useful to perform tests of subservices (own subservices or subservices offered by suppliers).",
                "Different schedules are possible to perform the active probing.",
                "The provider could select to test important services and resources in regular time intervals.",
                "Other tests could be initiated by a user who traverses the decision tree of the Intelligent Assistant including active tests.",

                "While the events that are received from management tools and customers denote negative events (something does not work), the events from active probing should also contain positive events for a better discrimination. 4.6 Event Correlator The event correlation should not be performed by a single event correlator, but by using different steps.",
                "The reason for this are the different characteristics of the dependencies (see Fig. 1).",
                "On the resource level there are only relationships between resources (network topology, systems configuration).",
                "An example for this could be a switch linking separate LANs.",
                "If the switch is down, events are reported that other network components which are located behind the switch are also not reachable.",
                "When correlating these events it can be figured out that the switch is the likely error cause.",
                "At this stage, the integration of service events does not seem to be helpful.",
                "The result of this step is a list of resources which could be the problems root cause.",
                "The resource event correlator is used to perform this step.",
                "In the service-oriented scenario there are also service and resource dependencies.",
                "As next step in the event correlation process the service events should be correlated with each other using the service dependencies, because the service dependencies have no direct relationship to the resource level.",
                "The result of this step, which is performed by the service event correlator, is a list of services/subservices which could contain a failure in a resource.",
                "If, e.g., there are service events from customers that two services do not work and both services depend on a common subservice, it seems more likely that the resource failure can be found inside the subservice.",
                "The output of this correlation is a list of services/subservices which could be affected by a failure in an associated resource.",
                "In the last step the aggregate event correlator matches the lists from resource event correlator and service event correlator to find the problems possible root cause.",
                "This is done by using the resource dependencies.",
                "The event correlation techniques presented in Section 2 could be used to perform the correlation inside the three event correlators.",
                "If the dependencies can be found precisely, an RBR or codebook approach seems to be appropriate.",
                "A case database (CBR) could be used if there are cases which could not be covered by RBR or the codebook approach.",
                "These cases could then be used to improve the modeling in a way that RBR or the codebook approach can deal with them in future correlations. 5.",

                "Another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay.",

                "In case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the DNS subservice at the beginning, but after the address is resolved a download failure is unlikely to have been caused by the DNS.",

                "To summarize, the reasons for the necessity of a serviceoriented <br>event correlation</br> are the following: Keeping of SLAs (top-down perspective): The time interval between the first symptom (recognized either by provider, network management tools, or customers) that a service does not perform properly and the verified fault repair needs to be minimized.",
                "This is especially needed with respect to SLAs as such agreements often contain guarantees like a mean time to repair.",

                "Later, the resource management finds out that a broken link is the failures root cause.",
                "It informs the event correlator about this and it can be determined that this explains all previous events.",
                "Therefore, the <br>event correlation</br> can be stopped at this point.",
                "Depending on the providers customer relationship management the finding of the root cause and an expected repair time could be reported to the customers.",
                "After the link has been repaired, it is possible to report this event via the CSM interface.",
                "Even though many details of this <br>event correlation</br> process could also be performed differently, the example showed an important advantage of the service-oriented <br>event correlation</br>.",
                "The relationship between the service provisioning and the providers resources is explicitly modeled.",
                "This allows a mapping of the customer report onto the provider-internal resources. 6.4 <br>event correlation</br> for Different Services If a provider like the LRZ offers several services the serviceoriented <br>event correlation</br> can be used to reveal relationships that are not obvious in the first place.",
                "If the LRZ E-Mail Service and its events are viewed in relationship with the events for the Virtual WWW Server, it is possible to identify failures in common subservices and resources.",
                "Both services depend on the DNS which means that customer reports like I cannot retrieve new e-mail and The web site of my research institute is not available can have a common cause, e.g., the DNS does not work properly. 7.",
                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In our paper we showed the need for a service-oriented <br>event correlation</br>.",
                "For an IT service provider this new kind of <br>event correlation</br> makes it possible to automatically map problems with the current service quality onto resource failures.",
                "This helps to find the failures root cause earlier and to reduce costs for SLA violations.",
                "In addition, customer reports can be linked together and therefore the processing effort can be reduced.",
                "To receive these benefits we presented our approach for performing the service-oriented <br>event correlation</br> as well as a modeling of the necessary correlation information.",
                "In the future we are going to apply our workflow and information modeling for services offered by the Leibniz Supercomputing Center going further into details.",
                "Several issues have not been treated in detail so far, e.g., the consequences for the service-oriented <br>event correlation</br> if a subservice is offered by another provider.",
                "If a service does not perform properly, it has to be determined whether this is caused by the provider himself or by the subservice.",
                "In the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the CSM interface.",
                "Another issue is the use of active probing in the <br>event correlation</br> process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a correlation delay.",
                "Another important point is the precise definition of dependency which has also been left out by many other publications.",
                "To avoid having to much dependencies in a certain situation one could try to check whether the dependencies currently exist.",
                "In case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the DNS subservice at the beginning, but after the address is resolved a download failure is unlikely to have been caused by the DNS.",
                "Another possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service into its possible user interactions (e.g., an e-mail service into transactions like get mail, sent mail, etc) and to define the dependencies for each user interaction.",
