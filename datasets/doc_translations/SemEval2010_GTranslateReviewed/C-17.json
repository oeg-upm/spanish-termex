Recent trends favour services ported on packet-switched networks. For audio conferencing, we need to consider many issues - scalability, quality of the conference application, floor control and load on the clients/servers - to name a few. In this paper, we describe an audio service framework designed to provide a Virtual Conferencing Environment (VCE). The system is designed to accommodate a large number of end users speaking at the same time and spread across the Internet. The framework is based on Conference Servers [14], which facilitate the audio handling, while we exploit the SIP capabilities for signaling purposes. Client selection is based on a recent quantifier called Loudness Number that helps mimic a physical face-to-face conference. We deal with deployment issues of the proposed solution both in terms of scalability and interactivity, while explaining the techniques we use to reduce the traffic. We have implemented a Conference Server (CS) application on a campus-wide network at our Institute.

INTRODUCTION Todays Internet uses the IP protocol suite that was primarily designed for the transport of data and provides best effort data delivery. Delay-constraints and characteristics separate traditional data on the one hand from voice & video applications on the other. Hence, as progressively time-sensitive voice and video applications are deployed on the Internet, the inadequacy of the Internet is exposed. Further, we seek to port telephone services on the Internet. Among them, virtual conference (teleconference) facility is at the cutting edge. Audio and video conferencing on Internet are popular [25] for the several advantages they inhere [3,6]. Clearly, the bandwidth required for a teleconference over the Internet increases rapidly with the number of participants; reducing bandwidth without compromising audio quality is a challenge in Internet Telephony. Additional critical issues are: (a) packet delay, (b) echo, (c) mixing of audio from selected clients, (d) automatic selection of clients to participate in the conference, (e) playout of mixed audio for every client, (f) handling clients not capable of mixing audio streams (such clients are known as dumb clients), and (g) deciding the number of simultaneously active clients in the conference without compromising voice quality. While all the above requirements are from the technology point of view, the users perspective and interactions are also essential factors. There is plenty of discussion amongst HCI and CSCW community on the use of Ethnomethodology for design of CSCW applications. The basic approach is to provide larger bandwidth, more facilities and more advanced control mechanisms, looking forward to better quality of interaction. This approach ignores the functional utility of the environment that is used for collaboration. Eckehard Doerry [4] criticizes this approach by saying it is keeping form before function. Thus, the need is to take an approach that considers both aspects - the technical and the functional. Regarding the functional aspect, we refer to [15] where it has been dealt with in some detail. In this work, we do not discuss video conferencing; its inclusion does not significantly benefit conference quality [4]. Our focus is on virtual audio environments. We first outline the challenges encountered in virtual audio conferences. Then we look into the motivations followed by relevant literature. In Section 5, we explain the architecture of our system. Section 6 comprises description of the various algorithms used in our setup. We address deployment issues. A discussion on Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne. Former visitor at CEDT. PESIT and NIAS, Bangalore, India.iv ii performance follows. We conclude taking alongside some implementation issues. 2. CHALLENGES IN VoIP CONFERENCING Many challenges arise in building a VoIP application. The following are of particular concern in the process: • Ease of use: Conferencing must be simple; users need no domain expertise. Management (addition/removal) of clients and servers must be uncomplicated. Application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers. Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies. • Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on. Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion. So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention. Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition. • Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance. The above requirements are placed in the perspective of observations made in earlier works (vide Sections 3 and 4) and will steer the VCE design. 3. THE MOTIVATION Ramanathan and Rangan [20] have studied in detail the architectural configurations comparing many conferencing architecture schemes taking into consideration the network delay and computation requirements for mixing. Functional division and object-oriented architecture design that aid in implementation is presented in [1]. An overview of many issues involved in supporting a large conference is dealt in [8]. H. P. Dommel [5] and many others highlight floor control as another pivotal aspect to be taken into account in designing a conferencing tool. Tightly coupled conference control protocols in Internet belong to the ITU-T H.323 family [9]; however, they are mainly for small conferences. The latest IETF draft by Rosenberg and Schulzrinne [23] discusses conferencing models with SIP [22] in the background. Aspects of implementation for centralized SIP conferencing are reported in [26]. A new approach called partial mixing by Radenkovic [18] allows for mixed and non-mixed streams to coexist. In all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • In an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed. Actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech). The number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants. This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality. Customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active. There is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality. Fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using Ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three. Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one. This way, the conference becomes markedly artificial and its quality degrades. Schulzrinne et al. [24], assume only one participant is speaking at a time. In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes gagging for the users. • Partial mixing [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed. Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15]. • For large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up. With multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a clients network increases unnecessarily. Evidently, different particular issues, all of which are a subset of requirements (defined in [14] and [16]) for a VoIP conferencing support, are tackled. Thus there is a need to address conferencing as a whole with all its requirements considered concurrently. Towards this goal, the VoIP conferencing system we propose is intended to be scalable and interactive. We make use of the Loudness Number for implementing floor control. This permits a participant to freely get into the speaking mode to interrupt the current speaker as in a natural face-to-face meeting. An upper limit on the number of floors (i.e., the number of speakers allowed to speak at the same time) is fixed using a conjecture proposed in [15]. The work presented here is in continuation of our studies into conferencing based on the Session Initiation Protocol in [14] and [16]. SIP, defined in [22] is now the most popular standard for VoIP deployment and has been chosen for its strength, ease of use, extensibility and compatibility. This is the reason it will be in the background of all controlling messages that will implicitly arise between the entities in our architecture. The actual messages are described in [16] and, as such, we do not present a complete description of them here. 4. RELATED WORK The SIP standard defined in RFC 3261 [22] and in later extensions such as [21] does not offer conference control services such as floor control or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed. However SIP can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference control protocol. The core SIP specification supports many models for conferencing [26, 23]. In the server-based models, a server mixes media streams, whereas in a server-less conference, mixing is done at the end systems. SDP [7] can be used to define media capabilities and provide other information about the conference. We shall now consider a few conference models in SIP that have been proposed recently [23]. First, let us look into server-less models. In End-System Mixing, only one client (SIP UA) handles the signaling and media mixing for all the others, which is clearly not scalable and causes problems when that particular client leaves the conference. In the Users Joining model, a tree grows, as each invited party constitutes a new branch in the distribution path. This leads to an increasing number of hops for the remote leaves and is not scalable. Another option would be to use multicast for conferencing but multicast is not enabled over Internet and only possible on a LAN presently. Among server-based models, in a Dial-In Conference, UAs connect to a central server that handles all the mixing. This model is not scalable as it is limited by the processing power of the server and bandwidth of the network. Adhoc Centralized Conferences and Dial-Out Conference Servers have similar mechanisms and problems. Hybrid models involving centralized signaling and distributed media, with the latter using unicast or multicast, raise scalability problems as before. However an advantage is that the conference control can be a third party solution. Distributed Partial Mixing, presented in [18], proposes that in case of bandwidth limitation, some streams are mixed and some are not, leaving interactivity intact. Loss of spatialism when they mix and the bandwidth increase when they do not are open problems. A related study [19] by the same author proposes conferencing architecture for Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) but does not provide the scalability angle without the availability of multicasting. With the limitations of proposed conferencing systems in mind, we will now detail our proposal. 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE This section is dedicated to the description of the proposed system architecture. However, as this paper constitutes the continuation of our work started in [14] and furthered in [16], we will not present here all the details about the proposed entities and invite the readers to consult the papers mentioned above for a full and thorough description. First, we do not restrict our conferencing system to work on small conferences only, but rather on large audio VCEs that have hundreds (or even thousands) of users across a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet. This view stems from an appraisal that VCEs will gain in importance in the future, as interactive audio conferences will be more popular because of the spread of the media culture around the world. Two issues must be taken care of when building a VoIP conferencing system: (i) the front-end, consisting of the application program running on the end-users computers and (ii) the back-end that provides other application programs that facilitate conferencing and conference. The participating users are grouped into several domains. These domains are Local Area Networks (LANs), such as corporate or educational networks. This distributed assumption asks for distributed controlling and media handling solutions, as centralized systems would not scale for such very large conferences (vide Section 4). More explicitly, in each domain, we can identify several relevant logical components of a conferencing facility (Fig. 1):  An arbitrary number of end users (clients) that can take part in at most one audio conference at a time. Every user is Fig. 1. Conference example - 3 domains containing the necessary entities so that the conference can take place. included in one and only one domain at a given instant, but can move from domain to domain (nomadism). In our conferencing environment, these clients are regular SIP User Agents (SIP UAs), as defined in [22] so to gain in interoperability with other existing SIP-compatible systems. These clients are thus not aware of the complex setting that supports the conference and this is highlighted below.  One SIP Server (SIPS) per domain, taking care of all the signaling aspects of the conference (clients joining, leaving, etc.) [16]. In particular, it is considered as a physical implementation encompassing different logical roles, namely a SIP Proxy Server, a SIP Registrar Server, a SIP Redirect Server and a SIP B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent) [22]. This physical implementation enables the handling of incoming/outgoing SIP messages by one or another logical entity according to the needs. SIPS is entrusted with maintaining total service and has many advantages such as (a) it works as a centralized entity that can keep track of the activities of the UAs in a conference; (b) it can do all the switching for providing PBX features; (c) it can locate the UAs and invite them for a conference; (d) it can do the billing as well. SIPSs in different domains communicate with each other using SIP messages as described in [16]. If the load on a particular SIPS is too heavy, it can create another SIPS in the same domain so that the load will be shared.  One Master Conference Server (M-CS) (simply a Conference Server (CS)) for each conference is created by the local SIPS when a conference starts. This server will be used for handling media packets for the clients of the domain. Its mechanism will be described in the next section. The M-CS will be able to create a hierarchy of CSs inside a domain by adding one or more Slave CSs (S-CSs) to accommodate all the active clients and prevent its own flooding at the same time. We will see this mechanism in some detail in the sequel. The entities described here are exhaustive and conform to the SIP philosophy. Thus, the use of SIP makes this architecture more useful and interoperable with any other SIP clients or servers. 6. ALGORITHMIC ISSUES 6.1 Selecting the Streams Similar to SipConf in [27], a Conference Server (CS) [17] has the function of supporting the conference; it is responsible for handling audio streams using RTP. It can also double to convert audio stream formats for a given client if necessary and can work as Translators/Mixers of RTP specification behind firewalls. We have based the design of our CS on H.323 Multipoint Processor (MP) [9]. In short, the MP receives audio streams from the endpoints involved in a centralized or hybrid multipoint conference, processes them and returns them to the endpoints. An MP that processes audio prepares NMax audio outputs from M input streams after selection, mixing, or both. Audio mixing requires decoding the input audio to linear signals (PCM or analog), performing a linear combination of the signals and reencoding the result in an appropriate audio format. The MP may eliminate or attenuate some of the input signals in order to reduce noise and unwanted components. Fig. 2. Schematic diagram of a CS The limitation of H.323 is that it does not address the scalability of a conference. The architecture proposes a cascaded or daisy chain topology [10], which can be shown that it cannot scale up for a large conference. A CS serves many clients in the same conference. Thus it handles only one conference at a time. Multiple CSs may coexist in a domain, as when there are several conferences under way. Signaling-related messages of CSs are dealt in [11]. The working of a CS is illustrated on Fig. 2: For each mixing interval, CS 1 chooses the best NMax audio packets out of the M1 (using a criterion termed Loudness Number, described in the next subsection). It may possibly receive and sends these to CSs 2 to P. The set of packets sent is denoted as ToOtherCSs. In the same mixing interval, it also receives the best NMax audio packets (out of possibly M2) from CS 2, similarly the best NMax (out of possibly MP) from CS P. For simplicity, we ignore propagation delay between CSs which indeed can be taken into account; it is beyond the scope of this presentation. The set of packets received is denoted as FromOtherCSs. Finally, it selects the best NMax packets from the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} and passes these packets to its own group. It can be seen that the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} is the same at all CSs. This ensures that any client in the conference finally receives the same set of packets for mixing. Hence all clients obtain a common view of the conference. Similarly, for each time slot (packet time), a subset, F of all clients is selected (using the same criterion) from the pool of packets from all other CSs plus the NMax clients selected locally. Their packets are mixed and played out at the clients. According to [15], the cardinality of F, |F| is NMax and is fixed at three. In our conferencing setup, selection is by the Master Conference Server (M-CS), which comes into the picture exclusively for media handling. Note that even if the SIP specification enables direct UA-to-UA media communication in a one-to-one call, it is also possible to use the Conference Server for two-party calls, especially because it is then more functional to create a real conference by adding a third and subsequently more participant(s). There are cases wherein the processing capacity of an M-CS is exceeded as it may have too many packets - from local domains and from remote domains - to process. In that case, the M-CS will create one or many S-CS (Fig. 6) and transfer its own clients as well as the new clients to them. In this configuration, the algorithm outlined above will be slightly modified, as the audio packets will go from clients to their dedicated S-CS that will select NMax packets to send to the local M-CS, which will then select NMax packets from all its S-CSs in the domain before sending them to the remote domains. The incoming packets from other domains will be received by the M-CS, select NMax of them and send them directly to the domain clients, bypassing the SCSs. This change implies that at most three intermediate entities exist for each audio packet, instead of two in the conventional setup. As the extra hop happens inside the LAN supposed to have a high-speed connectivity, we consider that it should not prevent us from using this hierarchy of CSs when theres a need to do so. 6.2 Loudness Number (LN) A basic question to be answered by the CS is the following. In a mixing interval, how should it choose NMax packets out of the M it might possibly receive? One way is to rank the M packets received according to their energies, and choose the top NMax. However, this is usually found to be inadequate because random fluctuations in packet energies can lead to poor audio quality. This indicates the need for a metric different from mere individual packet energies. The metric should have the following characteristics [12]: • A speaker (floor occupant) should not be cut off by a spike in the packet energy of another speaker. This implies that a speakers speech history should be given some weight. This is often referred to as Persistence or Hangover. • A participant who wants to interrupt a speaker will have to (i) speak loudly and (ii) keep trying for a little while. In a face-to-face conference, body language often indicates the intent to interrupt. But in a blind conference under discussion, a participants intention to interrupt can be conveyed effectively through LN. A floor control mechanism empowered to cut off a speaker forcefully must be ensured. These requirements are met by Loudness Number [12], which changes smoothly with time so that the selection (addition and deletion) of clients for conference is graceful. LN (= ) is a function of the amplitude of the current audio stream plus the activity and amplitude over a specific window in the past. Fig. 3. The different windows used for LN computation The Loudness Number is updated on a packet-by-packet basis. The basic parameter used here is packet amplitude, which is calculated as root mean square (rms) of the energies in audio samples of a packet, and denoted by XK. Three windows are defined as shown in Fig. 3. The present amplitude level of the speaker is found by calculating the moving average of packet amplitude (XK) within a window called Recent Past Window starting from the present instant to some past time. The past activity of the speaker is found by calculating the moving average of the packet amplitude (XK) within a window called Distant Past Window, which starts at the point where the Recent Past window ends and stretches back in the past for a pre-defined interval. The activity of the speaker in the past is found with a window called Activity Horizon, which spans the recent past window as well as the distant past window and beyond if necessary. Though the contribution of the activity horizon looks similar to the contribution of the recent past and distant past windows, past activity is computed from activity horizon window in a differently. Define the quantities during these three intervals as L1, L2 and L3. L1 quantifies the Recent Past speech activity, L2 the Distant Past speech activity and L3 gives a number corresponding to the speech activity in the Activity Horizon window quantifying how active the speaker was in the past few intervals. L3 yields a quantity that is proportional to the fraction of packets having energies above a pre-defined threshold (Eq. 3). The threshold is invariant across clients. ∑ +− = = 1 1 1 RPP P Wt tK K RP X W L (1) ∑ +−− −= = 1 2 1 DPRPP RPP WWt WtK K DP X W L (2) ∑ +− = ≥= 1 }{3 * 1 AHP P K Wt tK X AH I W L θθ (3) Where ifI KX 1}{ =≥θ θ≥KX = otherwise,0 The threshold is a constant. is set at 10-20 percent of the amplitude of the voice samples of a packet in our implementation here.

After one conferee becomes silent, another can take the floor. Also, as there is more than one channel, interruption is enabled. A loud conferee is more likely to be heard because of elevated λ. This ensures fairness to all conferees. After all, even in a face-to-face conference, a more vocal speaker grabs special attention. All these desirable characteristics are embedded into the LN. A comprehensive discussion on selection of the various parameters and the dynamics of LN are beyond the scope of this paper. 6.4 Selection Algorithm using the LN Following the developments in subsections 6.1 and 6.2, we present the simple algorithm that runs at each Master-Conference Server (Algorithm. 1). This algorithm is based on the discussions in section 6.1. The globally unique set F is found using this procedure. Repeat for each time slot at each M-CS { 1. Get all the packets from the Clients that belong to it. 2. Find at most NMax Clients that have PD[LPXP RXW RI 0 &OLHQWV LQ LWV GRPDLQ\u0011 3.

Now compare the packets in DB1 and DB2 on WKH EDVLV RI DQG VHOHFW D PD[LPXP RI NMax amongst them (to form set F) that should be played out at each Client. 7. Send the NMax packets in set F to the Clients in its domain. 8. Mix these NMax audio packets in set F after linearising and send it to dumb Clients in the domain. } Algorithm 1. Selection algorithm The mechanism proposed here is also depicted on Fig. 6, where a single conference takes place between three domains. The shaded clients are the ones selected in their local domains; their audio streams will be sent to other CSs. 7. DEPLOYMENT ISSUES We now analyze deployment issues associated with conference management. How are domains to be organized to maximize the number of participants able to join? To address this, we define some useful parameters.  Let d be the number of different domains in which there are active clients in a given conference.  Let Mi be the number of active clients present in domain i ( di ≤≤1 ) in a given conference. The total number of active clients in the conference is thus ∑= = d i iMM 1 .  Let C be the maximum number of audio streams a Conference Server can handle in a packet time, also called capacity. C is set according to the processing power of the weakest CS in the conference but as it cannot be assumed that we know it a-priori, it can be set according to some minimum system requirement a machine must meet in order to take part in a conference.  Let NMax be the number of output streams a CS has to send to other CSs in remote domains (see section 6.1). We will set NMax =3 (=|F|), according to [15]. The optimization problem is now to find the value of d that maximizes the total number of clients Mi served by one CS in a domain with capacity C. We first dispose the case where the capacity is not exceeded (the existing CS is not overloaded), and then proceed to the case where there exists a need to create more CSs when a single CS is overloaded. We assume that clients are equally distributed amongst the domains, as we may not have information to assume an a-priori distribution of the clients. We can specify no more than an upper bound on the number of clients acceptable, given the number of active domains d. 7.1 Conferencing with only One Level of CSs In this subsection, we consider that we have only one CS, i.e., a unique M-CS in each domain. Thus it cannot be overloaded. We consider that the system works as outlined in section 6.1: The Clients send their audio packets to their local CS, which selects NMax streams, before sending them to other CSs. In parallel, it also receives NMax streams for every other CSs before taking a decision on which NMax streams will be selected, sent and played out at each individual clients. For system stability, any CS in the conference should be able to handle its local clients in addition to the audio packets from other domains. Clearly then, the following inequality must hold for every domain: )1( −⋅+≥ dN d M C Max (5) The limiting case of (5) (taking the equality) takes the form 2 )( dNdNCM MaxMax ⋅−⋅+= (6) To optimize d with respect to M, we set 0)(2 =+−⋅⋅= ∂ ∂ MaxMax NCdN d M (7) yielding     ⋅ + = Max Max N NC d 2 (8) ([ ]* = Rounding to nearest integer) and hence, M from (6).

In Table 1, we give the values of d and M that were computed using (8) and (6) with NMax = 3. We see that the values of d and M, being dependent of C, are therefore based on the weakest CS. We see that there is a trade-off between M and d. We could admit more domains in the conference, but at the expense of restricting the total number of clients M in the conference. While implementing and testing the Conference Servers on a Pentium III 1.4 GHz running Windows NT, we were able to set C=300. But with the advent of faster computers (> 3 GHz), one can easily set C to higher values and determine d and M accordingly. Fig. 4 shows a contour plot and Fig. 5, a 3D-mesh showing optimized solutions for CSs of different capacities. These lead us to maximize the number of domains, and hence, to maximize the total number of clients based on the capacity of various CSs. In Fig. 4, the individual curves represent the total number of clients targeted, and we select a lower value of d, for capacity C, for targeted M to reduce traffic on WAN. Fig. 5 represents a different perspective of the same data in 3D. Fig. 4. Contour Plot of Capacity versus Optimum number of domains for various conference sizes 7.2 Conferencing with Two Levels of CSs Now considering the case where the number of clients in a particular domain is too large, i.e., d M Mi ≥ (9) one has to avoid the denial of service for new clients due to overloading of Conference Server. This problem can be solved by introducing a second level of CSs inside the given domain, as in Fig. 6. The existing M-CS creates a Slave CS (S-CS) that can handle up to C end-users and to which it transfers all its active clients. Here, the system works differently as outlined in section 6.1: The Clients send their audio packets to their local S-CS, which selects NMax streams, before sending them to a local M-CS, which will proceed in the same way, before sending NMax streams to the other domains. Each newly created S-CS must run on a separate machine. The M-CS has to create more S-CSs if the number of active clients exceeds C in the course of the conference after the transfer. With this mechanism, the M-CS will be able to create utmost     −⋅− = Max Max N dNC U )1( S-CSs, (10) as it must handle 3 (= NMax) packets for each local S-CSs and 3 (= NMax) packets from each other remote domains. We can then calculate the maximum theoretical number of active clients CUMi ⋅= in each domain as well as M, for the whole conference as CUdM ⋅⋅= . Fig. 5. 3D Plot of Capacity versus Optimum number of domains for various conference sizes Of course, one could further create a third level in the hierarchy, giving the possibility of accommodating even more clients. This may be unnecessary as the number of possible clients is large enough with two levels. 8. PERFORMANCE DISCUSSION We now analyze the performance of the algorithm presented in subsection 6.3, i.e., the one taking care of the exchange of audio packets between the different domains. Note that the packets that are transiting within the LAN take advantage of the higher capacity (generally coupled with multicast capabilities) and therefore do not require a performance analysis. Thus we have to look only at the RTP packets over the WAN, i.e., between participating M-CSs. As each M-CS from a domain will be sending only NMax out of d M packets to the other CSs ( MaxN d M >> ), the bandwidth used by the application over a WAN is upper-bounded by the following expression. The total number of audio packets transiting over the WAN for each time slot is ∑ ∑= ≠=        d i d ijj MaxN 1 ,1 which is quadratic in the number of domains (i.e., O(d2 )). However, it is independent of the total number of active clients. This would not have been the case had all packets been sent over the network in each time slot. The saving is tremendous. Yet, one may contend that sending three packets to and from all domains is a waste of resources, as most of these streams will not be selected. If just one client is active, selecting a subset of clients in that domain is unnecessary. Pessimistic and optimistic algorithms as presented in the sequel aim at reducing the traffic further by harnessing the slow varying nature of the LN. 8.1 Pessimistic algorithm Consider a scenario wherein the lowest LN (called LNt) of the three globally selected streams (set F of Section 6.1) exceeds the LN of the most dominant stream of a domain. Evidently, the chances that the next two dominant streams of that domain being selected to F in the next packet period are less. Here, we send this most dominant stream and withhold the other two. There may be an error in unique selection across all domains for one packet period only. As LN varies slowly, the error would get automatically rectified in a subsequent packet period (slot). In this algorithm, there is at least one stream in each period. The net network traffic in a packet period in the best case is )1( −⋅ dd , i.e., )( 2 dO using unicast, instead of MaxNdd ⋅−⋅ )1( . Considerable valuable bandwidth can be saved using this heuristic. The resulting traffic complexity reduces from O(d2 ) to O(d) in multicast-enabled networks. Initialize LNt = 0 at an M-CS/S-CS A. In the first time slot (packet time), each CS sends the top NMax streams (based on their LN) to all other CSs. At each M-CS/S-CS and for each packet time: B. Find the value of lowest LN of the NMax globally selected streams (set F) from the previous time slot. Set LNt with this value. C. At each CS domain, select the NMax local streams that have maximum value of LN (ToOtherCSs set). D. Select streams that have LN > LNt. IF there are >= NMax streams with LN > LNt then send top NMax to other CSs. ELSE IF there are (NMax-1) streams with LN>LNt then send top (NMax-1) plus the one lower than LNt (i.e., top NMax) to other CSs. ELSE IF there are (NMax-2) streams with LN>LNt then send top (NMax-2) plus the one lower than LNt (i.e. top (NMax -1)) to other CSs. …… ELSE IF there are NO streams with LN> LNt then send top 1 stream to other CSs. E. Packets sent in step D form DB1. Packets received from other CSs form DB2. F. For this time slot, find global NMax streams based on LN from DB1 U DB2 (set F) G. Send set F to the clients in its domain. Update LNt for the next period. Algorithm 2. Pessimistic algorithm to reduce the number of packets sent over the Internet. Fig. 6. Example of a 2-level hierarchy of Conference Servers; the shaded Clients are the one selected by the M-CS and will be sent to other domains CSs. In this algorithm the saving in traffic is at the cost of relaxing the condition of formation of globally unique set F. However, the discrepancies in selected streams at different domains remain for a short period of time depending on the transportation delay between any two domains. Even for a total delay of 400ms, for only 10 packet time slots the uniqueness is lost. This duration in a real-time interactive conversation is non-perceivable by the listener. In the case that there is a joke and every one laughs, then there would be sudden rise in the number of packets and it would be upper bounded by MaxN)d(O 2 for a short period. 8.2 Optimistic Algorithm The traffic can be reduced further. The scheme in the following algorithm (Algorithm. 3) is withholding all the streams that have less value of LN compared to the least of the three in the set F. We can find the correct and unique three streams after a few time slots depending on the transportation delay between the domains. As the packet period is of the order of 40ms, the error in the selection is unnoticeable. The number of streams on network in this case is always restricted to NMax (=3). Even without Voice Activity Detection (VAD), there will be no more than three streams in the network in the best case, thus the total traffic is constant. A sudden burst of traffic, as described in 8.1, is a particular case. These advantages are due to exploitation of the characteristics of LN. Initialize LNt = 0 at an M-CS/S-CS A. In the first time slot (packet time), each CS sends the top NMax streams (based on their LN) to all other CSs. At each M-CS/S-CS and for each packet time: B. Find the value of lowest LN of the NMax globally selected streams (set F) from the previous time slot. Set LNt with this value. C. At each CS domain, select the NMax local streams that have maximum value of LN (ToOtherCSs set) D. Select streams that have LN > LNt IF there are >= NMax streams with LN > LNt then send top NMax to other CSs. ELSE IF there are (NMax-1) streams with LN>LNt then send top (NMax-1) and see E. ELSE IF there are (NMax-2) streams with LN>LNt then send top (NMax-2) and see E. …… ELSE IF there are NO streams with LN> LNt then dont send any stream. E. Exceptions: IF the stream that was in F in the last interval belongs to this CS then select and send that stream even if its LN is now < LNt. (Note this occurs only at that CS which had the stream that was the last of the three in the previous packet period.) F. Packets sent in step D and E form DB1. Packets received from other CSs form DB2. G. For this time slot, find global NMax streams based on LN from DB1 U DB2 (set F). H. Send set F to the clients in its domain. Update LNt for the next period. Algorithm 3. Optimistic algorithm to reduce the number of packets sent over the Internet Furthermore, when VAD is used [13], it would further reduce the traffic by sending the header part of the RTP packet only and not the whole packet, thus in order to keep updating the LN across. The traffic here in this case is O(NMax) for multicast and O(d) for unicast. We see that the above algorithms save bandwidth and computation at each CS, and leads to a scalable architecture with multiple CSs mainly because clients are grouped in domains. The necessary bandwidth is not dependent on the total number of active clients. As the CS always chooses the best three clients out of all the clients assigned to it in the domain, addition of new clients to the existing conference will not cause any scalability problem. 8.3 Availability of Multicasting In the architecture that has been proposed, no assumption was made about the availability of multicasting support from the network. The traffic will be further reduced if multicasting is available over WAN. It is simple to show that the order of traffic would tend to become O(d) from O(d2 ). This is an approximation as saving in multicasting depends also on the topology. The analysis was done for the case wherein multicast is not available (a realistic assumption in todays Internet). The advantage of this set up is that we can use it even if multicasting is partially available. We can instruct CSs during the set-up phase to send unicast packets to those CSs that cannot receive multicast packets whereas CSs on multicast enabled routers can exchange packets on a multicast address. The data structures and conference objects inside a CS is given in [14]. Fig. 7. User Interface for setting the weight for NMax audio streams (setting Self-bar to zero avoids echo). 8.4 Quality Improvement The observed improvement in the perceived quality of the conference service is due to: (1) limiting the number of concurrent speakers to a low number such as three. Generally, in a conference if more than two participants speak the intelligibility is lost. The conversational analysis demonstrates that there would be a repair mechanism [15] in such a case. (2) Delay: The audio stream between any two clients will pass through at most two CSs thus reducing the end-to-end delay. For a large conference there might be three CSs however, one hop is within the domain incurring negligible delay. (3) As the streams are mixed only at the clients, there can be a customized mix of the streams. The individual tuning of mixing with weights the spatialism is preserved. Fig. 7 shows the user interface for the same. The echo when self-stream is selected can be avoided by reducing the weight. Nonetheless, feedback helps in reassuring speaker that he/she is heard by all. 9. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a discussion on a voice-only virtual conferencing environment. We have argued that the distributed nature of deployment here makes it scalable. Interactivity is achieved by adapting a recent stream selection scheme based on Loudness Number. Additionally, we incorporate a result from a more recent work [15] where the sufficiency of three simultaneous speakers has been demonstrated. Thus, there is significantly effective utilization of bandwidth. A mixed stream is played out at each client; each client may choose to have a customized mix since mixing is done at the local terminal of each client. These render impromptu speech in a virtual teleconference over VoIP a reality, as in a real face-to-face conference. Compatibility is assured thanks to the use of SIP, the most soughtafter signaling protocol. To ensure a satisfying performance, we do not demand the availability of multicast, but use it if and when available. The traffic in the WAN (Internet) is upper-bounded by the square of the number of domains, -- further reduced by using heuristic algorithms -- which is far below the total number of clients in the conference. This is due to the use of a Conference Server local to each domain. VAD techniques help further traffic reduction. Using SIP standard for signaling makes this solution highly interoperable. We have implemented a CS application on a campus-wide network. We believe this new generation of virtual conferencing environments will gain more popularity in the future as their ease of deployment is assured thanks to readily available technologies and scalable frameworks. 10.

Las tendencias recientes favorecen los servicios portados en redes conmutadas por paquetes. Para la conferencia de audio, debemos considerar muchos problemas (escalabilidad, calidad de la aplicación de la conferencia, control de piso y carga en los clientes/servidores), por nombrar algunos. En este documento, describimos un marco de servicio de audio diseñado para proporcionar un entorno de conferencia virtual (VCE). El sistema está diseñado para acomodar a una gran cantidad de usuarios finales que hablan al mismo tiempo y se extienden por Internet. El marco se basa en servidores de conferencias [14], que facilitan el manejo de audio, mientras explotamos las capacidades SIP para fines de señalización. La selección del cliente se basa en un cuantificador reciente llamado número de volumen que ayuda a imitar una conferencia física cara a cara. Tratamos con los problemas de implementación de la solución propuesta tanto en términos de escalabilidad como de interactividad, al tiempo que explicamos las técnicas que utilizamos para reducir el tráfico. Hemos implementado una aplicación de servidor de conferencias (CS) en una red de todo el campus en nuestro instituto. Categorías y sujetos Descriptores C.2.4 [Redes de comunicación por computadora]: Sistemas distribuidos: cliente / servidor, aplicaciones distribuidas. Algoritmos de términos generales, rendimiento, diseño, teoría.1. Introducción a Internet de hoy utiliza el conjunto de protocolo IP que fue diseñado principalmente para el transporte de datos y proporciona la entrega de datos del mejor esfuerzo. Las restricciones de retraso y las características separan los datos tradicionales por un lado de las aplicaciones de voz y video por el otro. Por lo tanto, a medida que se implementan aplicaciones de voz y video sensibles a tiempo progresivamente en Internet, la insuficiencia de Internet está expuesta. Además, buscamos portuar los servicios telefónicos en Internet. Entre ellos, la instalación de la Conferencia Virtual (Teleconferencia) está a la vanguardia. La audio y las videoconferencias en Internet son populares [25] para las diversas ventajas que inyectan [3,6]. Claramente, el ancho de banda requerido para una teleconferencia sobre Internet aumenta rápidamente con el número de participantes;Reducir el ancho de banda sin comprometer la calidad de audio es un desafío en la telefonía en Internet. Los problemas críticos adicionales son: (a) retraso del paquete, (b) eco, (c) mezcla de audio de clientes seleccionados, (d) selección automática de clientes para participar en la conferencia, (e) Juego de audio mixto para cada cliente,(f) Manejo de clientes que no son capaces de mezclar transmisiones de audio (dichos clientes se conocen como clientes tontos) y (g) decidir el número de clientes activos simultáneamente en la conferencia sin comprometer la calidad de la voz. Si bien todos los requisitos anteriores son desde el punto de vista de la tecnología, la perspectiva de los usuarios y las interacciones también son factores esenciales. Hay mucha discusión entre la comunidad HCI y CSCW sobre el uso de etnometodología para el diseño de aplicaciones CSCW. El enfoque básico es proporcionar un ancho de banda más grande, más instalaciones y mecanismos de control más avanzados, esperando una mejor calidad de interacción. Este enfoque ignora la utilidad funcional del entorno que se utiliza para la colaboración. Eckehard Derry [4] critica este enfoque al decir que está manteniendo la forma antes de la función. Por lo tanto, la necesidad es adoptar un enfoque que considere ambos aspectos: lo técnico y lo funcional. Con respecto al aspecto funcional, nos referimos a [15] donde se ha tratado con cierto detalle. En este trabajo, no discutimos la videoconferencia;Su inclusión no beneficia significativamente la calidad de la conferencia [4]. Nuestro enfoque está en los entornos de audio virtual. Primero describimos los desafíos encontrados en las conferencias de audio virtuales. Luego analizamos las motivaciones seguidas de la literatura relevante. En la Sección 5, explicamos la arquitectura de nuestro sistema. La Sección 6 comprende la descripción de los diversos algoritmos utilizados en nuestra configuración. Abordamos los problemas de implementación. Una discusión sobre el Instituto Swiss Federal de Tecnología, Lausana. Ex visitante en CEDT. Pesit y Nias, Bangalore, India. IVI El rendimiento sigue. Concluimos que se llevan junto con algunos problemas de implementación.2. Los desafíos en la conferencia de VoIP surgen muchos desafíos en la construcción de una aplicación VoIP. Los siguientes son de particular preocupación en el proceso: • Facilidad de uso: la conferencia debe ser simple;Los usuarios no necesitan experiencia en dominio. La gerencia (adición/eliminación) de los clientes y los servidores debe ser sin complicaciones. El desarrollo de la aplicación no debe presuponer las características específicas del sistema subyacente o de las capas de red. La facilidad de uso puede incluir tecnologías fácilmente disponibles, técnicamente factibles y económicamente viables.• Escalabilidad: la conferencia debe parecer ininterrumpida bajo cargas pesadas, es decir, cuando se agregan muchos usuarios adicionales. El tráfico en WAN no debe crecer apreciablemente con el número total de clientes;De lo contrario, esto ha llevado a la congestión. Por lo tanto, se necesita un medio para regular el tráfico al mínimo para este tipo de aplicaciones en tiempo real.• Interactividad: en entornos de conferencia virtual (VCE), pretendemos una aplicación de conferencia cara a cara que imita una conferencia real, donde más participantes vocales invitan a la atención. La toma de turnos en la ocupación del piso por parte de los participantes debe adaptarse con gracia para dar una sensación de transición natural.• Estandarización: la solución debe ajustarse a los estándares establecidos para obtener interoperabilidad y aceptación de pares. Los requisitos anteriores se colocan en la perspectiva de las observaciones realizadas en trabajos anteriores (vide las secciones 3 y 4) y dirigirán el diseño de VCE.3. La motivación Ramanathan y Rangan [20] han estudiado en detalle las configuraciones arquitectónicas que comparan muchos esquemas de arquitectura de conferencia teniendo en cuenta el retraso de la red y los requisitos de cálculo para la mezcla. División funcional y diseño de arquitectura orientado a objetos que ayuda en la implementación se presenta en [1]. Una visión general de muchos problemas involucrados en el apoyo a una gran conferencia se trata en [8]. H. P. Dommel [5] y muchos otros resaltan el control del piso como otro aspecto fundamental a tener en cuenta en el diseño de una herramienta de conferencia. Los protocolos de control de conferencias bien acoplados en Internet pertenecen a la familia ITU-T H.323 [9];Sin embargo, son principalmente para pequeñas conferencias. El último borrador de IETF de Rosenberg y Schulzrinne [23] analiza los modelos de conferencia con SIP [22] en el fondo. Los aspectos de la implementación para la conferencia SIP centralizada se informan en [26]. Un nuevo enfoque llamado mezcla parcial por Radenkovic [18] permite que coexistan corrientes mixtas y no mezcladas. En todas las propuestas anteriores, si bien hay algunas sugerencias muy útiles, comparten una o más de las siguientes limitaciones: • En una conferencia de audio, las transmisiones de todos los clientes no necesitan ser mezcladas. En realidad, mezclar muchas corrientes arbitrarias [24] de los clientes degrada la calidad de la conferencia debido a la reducción en el volumen (aspecto espacial del habla). El número de transmisiones mixtas varía dinámicamente dependiendo del número de participantes activos. Esto conduciría a fluctuaciones en el volumen de cada participante individual que causa una degradación severa en la calidad. La mezcla personalizada de transmisiones no es posible cuando muchos clientes están activos. Hay un umbral sobre el número de oradores simultáneos por encima de los cuales aumentar el número de oradores se vuelve contraproducente para la calidad de la conferencia. La fijación del número máximo de altavoces simultáneos se trata en un trabajo reciente [15] utilizando etnometodología, y se conjetura a tres. Por lo tanto, es aconsejable honrar esa restricción.• No puede haber muchos mezcladores intermedios (de manera similar, servidores de conferencias como en [10]) en las etapas como en [20] porque provoca un retraso excesivo al aumentar el número de lúpulo y no es escalable con la interactividad en el enfoque.• El control del piso para una conferencia de audio (incluso en la conferencia de video) con instrucciones explícitas de turnos para los participantes, la conferencia es esencialmente un asunto de un solo speakerat-a-time, no uno en vivo y sin interrupciones. De esta manera, la conferencia se vuelve notablemente artificial y su calidad se degrada. Schulzrinne et al.[24], suponga que solo un participante está hablando a la vez. En este caso, si las aplicaciones se implementan con algún control [5], el servicio se vuelve numerosa para los usuarios.• La mezcla parcial [18] tiene un problema similar al de la mezcla cuando se mezclan más corrientes. Además, en [18], para permitir un discurso improvisado, la mezcla no se realiza cuando la red puede pagar los altos requisitos de ancho de banda para enviar/recibir todas las transmisiones, pero no es necesario [15].• Para grandes conferencias [23, 10] una conferencia centralizada no puede ampliar. Con la multidifusión, los clientes tendrán que analizar muchas transmisiones y el tráfico en una red de clientes aumenta innecesariamente. Evidentemente, se abordan diferentes problemas particulares, todos los cuales son un subconjunto de requisitos (definidos en [14] y [16]) para un soporte de conferencias VoIP. Por lo tanto, es necesario abordar las conferencias en su conjunto con todos sus requisitos considerados simultáneamente. Hacia este objetivo, el sistema de conferencia VOIP que proponemos está destinado a ser escalable e interactivo. Usamos el número de volumen para implementar el control del piso. Esto permite que un participante ingrese libremente en el modo de hablar para interrumpir el altavoz actual como en una reunión natural cara a cara. Un límite superior en el número de pisos (es decir, el número de altavoces que se permiten hablar al mismo tiempo) se fija utilizando una conjetura propuesta en [15]. El trabajo presentado aquí es en la continuación de nuestros estudios en conferencias basadas en el protocolo de inicio de la sesión en [14] y [16]. SIP, definido en [22] es ahora el estándar más popular para la implementación de VoIP y ha sido elegido por su fuerza, facilidad de uso, extensibilidad y compatibilidad. Esta es la razón por la que será en el fondo de todos los mensajes de control que surgirán implícitamente entre las entidades de nuestra arquitectura. Los mensajes reales se describen en [16] y, como tal, no presentamos una descripción completa de ellos aquí.4. Trabajo relacionado El estándar SIP definido en RFC 3261 [22] y en extensiones posteriores como [21] no ofrece servicios de control de conferencias como control de piso o votación y no prescribe cómo se va a administrar una conferencia. Sin embargo, SIP se puede utilizar para iniciar una sesión que utiliza algún otro protocolo de control de conferencias. La especificación SIP central admite muchos modelos para conferencias [26, 23]. En los modelos basados en servidor, un servidor mezcla transmisiones de medios, mientras que en una conferencia sin servidor, la mezcla se realiza en los sistemas finales. SDP [7] se puede utilizar para definir las capacidades de los medios y proporcionar otra información sobre la conferencia. Ahora consideraremos algunos modelos de conferencias en SIP que se han propuesto recientemente [23]. Primero, veamos modelos sin servidor. En la mezcla del sistema final, solo un cliente (SIP UA) maneja la señalización y la mezcla de medios para todos los demás, lo que claramente no es escalable y causa problemas cuando ese cliente en particular abandona la conferencia. En el modelo de unión de usuarios, un árbol crece, ya que cada parte invitada constituye una nueva rama en la ruta de distribución. Esto lleva a un número creciente de lúpulo para las hojas remotas y no es escalable. Otra opción sería usar multidifusión para conferencias, pero la multidifusión no está habilitada en Internet y solo es posible en una LAN actualmente. Entre los modelos basados en servidor, en una conferencia de marcación, UAS se conecta a un servidor central que maneja toda la mezcla. Este modelo no es escalable, ya que está limitado por el poder de procesamiento del servidor y el ancho de banda de la red. Las conferencias centralizadas de ADHOC y los servidores de conferencias de marcación tienen mecanismos y problemas similares. Los modelos híbridos que involucran señalización centralizada y medios distribuidos, con estos últimos usando unidifusión o multidifusión, plantean problemas de escalabilidad como antes. Sin embargo, una ventaja es que el control de la conferencia puede ser una solución de terceros. La mezcla parcial distribuida, presentada en [18], propone que en el caso de la limitación del ancho de banda, algunas transmisiones se mezclan y otras no lo están, dejando intacta la interactividad. Pérdida de espacialismo cuando se mezclan y el ancho de banda aumenta cuando no son problemas abiertos. Un estudio relacionado [19] del mismo autor propone la arquitectura de conferencia para entornos virtuales colaborativos (CVE) pero no proporciona el ángulo de escalabilidad sin la disponibilidad de multidifusión. Con las limitaciones de los sistemas de conferencia propuestos, ahora detallaremos nuestra propuesta.5. Arquitectura del sistema Esta sección está dedicada a la descripción de la arquitectura del sistema propuesta. Sin embargo, como este documento constituye la continuación de nuestro trabajo comenzó en [14] y promovido en [16], no presentaremos aquí todos los detalles sobre las entidades propuestas e invitaremos a los lectores a consultar los documentos mencionados anteriormente para obtener una completa y completa.descripción. Primero, no restringimos que nuestro sistema de conferencias trabaje solo en pequeñas conferencias, sino en grandes VCE de audio que tienen cientos (o incluso miles) de usuarios en una red de área amplia (WAN) como Internet. Esta visión proviene de una evaluación que los VCE obtendrán importancia en el futuro, ya que las conferencias de audio interactivas serán más populares debido a la propagación de la cultura de los medios en todo el mundo. Se deben solucionar dos problemas al construir un sistema de conferencias VoIP: (i) el front-end, que consiste en el programa de aplicación que se ejecuta en las computadoras de los usuarios finales y (ii) el back-end que proporciona otros programas de aplicación que facilitan la conferencia de conferenciasy conferencia. Los usuarios participantes se agrupan en varios dominios. Estos dominios son redes de área local (LAN), como redes corporativas o educativas. Esta suposición distribuida solicita soluciones distribuidas de control y manejo de medios, ya que los sistemas centralizados no escalarían para conferencias tan grandes (vide Sección 4). Más explícitamente, en cada dominio, podemos identificar varios componentes lógicos relevantes de una instalación de conferencia (Fig. 1): un número arbitrario de usuarios finales (clientes) que pueden participar en la máximo de una conferencia de audio a la vez. Cada usuario es la figura 1. Ejemplo de conferencia: 3 dominios que contienen las entidades necesarias para que la conferencia pueda tener lugar.incluido en un solo dominio en un instante dado, pero puede pasar del dominio al dominio (nomadismo). En nuestro entorno de conferencia, estos clientes son agentes de usuarios SIP regulares (SIP UAS), como se define en [22], por lo tanto, para obtener en la interoperabilidad con otros sistemas compatibles con SIP existentes. Por lo tanto, estos clientes no están al tanto de la configuración compleja que respalda la conferencia y esto se destaca a continuación.Un servidor SIP (SIPS) por dominio, cuidando todos los aspectos de señalización de la conferencia (clientes que se unen, se van, etc.) [16]. En particular, se considera una implementación física que abarca diferentes roles lógicos, a saber, un servidor de proxy SIP, un servidor de registrador SIP, un servidor de redirección SIP y un SIP B2BUA (agente de usuario de regreso a la espalda) [22]. Esta implementación física permite el manejo de mensajes SIP entrantes/salientes por una u otra entidad lógica de acuerdo con las necesidades. SIPS se confía en mantener el servicio total y tiene muchas ventajas, como (a), funciona como una entidad centralizada que puede realizar un seguimiento de las actividades de la UAS en una conferencia;(b) puede hacer todo el cambio para proporcionar características de PBX;(c) puede localizar el UAS e invitarlos a una conferencia;(d) También puede hacer la facturación. Los sorbos en diferentes dominios se comunican entre sí utilizando mensajes SIP como se describe en [16]. Si la carga en un SIPS en particular es demasiado pesada, puede crear otros SIP en el mismo dominio para que la carga se comparta.Un servidor de conferencia maestra (M-CS) (simplemente un servidor de conferencias (CS)) para cada conferencia es creado por los SIP locales cuando comienza una conferencia. Este servidor se utilizará para manejar paquetes de medios para los clientes del dominio. Su mecanismo se describirá en la siguiente sección. El M-CS podrá crear una jerarquía de CSS dentro de un dominio agregando uno o más CSS de esclavos (S-CSS) para acomodar a todos los clientes activos y evitar sus propias inundaciones al mismo tiempo. Veremos este mecanismo con cierto detalle en la secuela. Las entidades descritas aquí son exhaustivas y se ajustan a la filosofía SIP. Por lo tanto, el uso de SIP hace que esta arquitectura sea más útil e interoperable con cualquier otro cliente o servidor SIP.6. Problemas algorítmicos 6.1 Selección de las transmisiones similares a SIPCONF en [27], un servidor de conferencias (CS) [17] tiene la función de apoyar la conferencia;Es responsable de manejar transmisiones de audio usando RTP. También puede duplicarse para convertir los formatos de transmisión de audio para un cliente determinado si es necesario y puede funcionar como traductores/mezcladores de especificaciones RTP detrás de los firewalls. Hemos basado el diseño de nuestra CS en el procesador Multipoint H.323 (MP) [9]. En resumen, el MP recibe transmisiones de audio de los puntos finales involucrados en una conferencia multipunto centralizada o híbrida, las procesa y las devuelve a los puntos finales. Un MP que procesa el audio prepara las salidas de audio NMAX de las transmisiones de entrada M después de la selección, la mezcla o ambos. La mezcla de audio requiere decodificar el audio de entrada a señales lineales (PCM o analógicas), realizar una combinación lineal de las señales y volver a codificar el resultado en un formato de audio apropiado. El MP puede eliminar o atenuar algunas de las señales de entrada para reducir el ruido y los componentes no deseados. Figura 2. Diagrama esquemático de A CS La limitación de H.323 es que no aborda la escalabilidad de una conferencia. La arquitectura propone una topología de cadena en cascada o margarita [10], que se puede demostrar que no puede ampliar una gran conferencia. Un CS atiende a muchos clientes en la misma conferencia. Por lo tanto, maneja solo una conferencia a la vez. Múltiples CS pueden coexistir en un dominio, como cuando hay varias conferencias en curso. Los mensajes relacionados con la señalización de CSS se tratan en [11]. El funcionamiento de un CS se ilustra en la Fig. 2: para cada intervalo de mezcla, CS 1 elige los mejores paquetes de audio NMAX del M1 (utilizando un criterio denominado número de volumen, descrito en la siguiente subsección). Posiblemente pueda recibir y enviarlos a CSS 2 a P. El conjunto de paquetes enviados se denota como OTHERCSS. En el mismo intervalo de mezcla, también recibe los mejores paquetes de audio NMAX (de posiblemente M2) de CS 2, de manera similar, el mejor nmax (de posiblemente MP) de CS P., por simplicidad, ignoramos el retraso de propagación entre CSS que puedeser tomado en cuenta;Está más allá del alcance de esta presentación. El conjunto de paquetes recibidos se denota como de OtherCSS. Finalmente, selecciona los mejores paquetes NMAX del conjunto {TootherCSS Union fromotherCSS} y pasa estos paquetes a su propio grupo. Se puede ver que el conjunto {toothercss union de Othercss} es el mismo en todos los CSS. Esto asegura que cualquier cliente en la conferencia finalmente reciba el mismo conjunto de paquetes para mezclar. Por lo tanto, todos los clientes obtienen una visión común de la conferencia. Del mismo modo, para cada ranura de tiempo (tiempo de paquete), se selecciona un subconjunto F de todos los clientes (usando el mismo criterio) del grupo de paquetes de todos los demás CSS más los clientes NMAX seleccionados localmente. Sus paquetes se mezclan y se juegan en los clientes. Según [15], la cardinalidad de F, | F |es nmax y se fija en tres. En nuestra configuración de conferencias, la selección es de Master Conference Server (M-CS), que entra en imagen exclusivamente para el manejo de los medios. Tenga en cuenta que incluso si la especificación SIP permite la comunicación directa de medios UA a UA en una llamada uno a uno, también es posible usar el servidor de conferencias para llamadas bipartidales, especialmente porque es más funcional crear unConferencia real agregando una tercera y posteriormente más participantes. Hay casos en los que se excede la capacidad de procesamiento de un M -CS, ya que puede tener demasiados paquetes, desde dominios locales y de dominios remotos, hasta procesar. En ese caso, el M-CS creará uno o muchos S-CS (Fig. 6) y transferirá a sus propios clientes, así como a los nuevos clientes. En esta configuración, el algoritmo descrito anteriormente se modificará ligeramente, ya que los paquetes de audio irán de los clientes a sus S-CS dedicados que seleccionarán paquetes NMAX para enviar a los M-CS locales, que luego seleccionarán paquetes NMAX de todos susS-CSS en el dominio antes de enviarlos a los dominios remotos. Los paquetes entrantes de otros dominios serán recibidos por el M-CS, seleccionarán NMAX de ellos y los enviarán directamente a los clientes de dominio, evitando el SCSS. Este cambio implica que, como máximo, existen tres entidades intermedias para cada paquete de audio, en lugar de dos en la configuración convencional. A medida que el salto adicional ocurre dentro de la LAN que se supone que tiene una conectividad de alta velocidad, consideramos que no debería evitar que usemos esta jerarquía de CSS cuando es necesario hacerlo.6.2 Número de volumen (LN) Una pregunta básica para ser respondida por la CS es la siguiente. En un intervalo de mezcla, ¿cómo debe elegir los paquetes NMAX de la M que podría recibir? Una forma es clasificar los paquetes M recibidos de acuerdo con sus energías y elegir el NMAX superior. Sin embargo, esto generalmente se encuentra inadecuado porque las fluctuaciones aleatorias en las energías de paquetes pueden conducir a una mala calidad de audio. Esto indica la necesidad de una métrica diferente de las meras energías de paquetes individuales. La métrica debe tener las siguientes características [12]: • Un altavoz (ocupante del piso) no debe ser cortado por un pico en la energía del paquete de otro altavoz. Esto implica que el historial del habla de los hablantes debe tener algo de peso. Esto a menudo se conoce como persistencia o resaca.• Un participante que quiera interrumpir un orador tendrá que (i) hablar en voz alta y (ii) seguir intentándolo por un tiempo. En una conferencia cara a cara, el lenguaje corporal a menudo indica la intención de interrumpir. Pero en una conferencia ciega en discusión, los participantes intencionan interrumpir se pueden transmitir de manera efectiva a través de LN. Se debe garantizar un mecanismo de control de piso capacitado para cortar un altavoz. Estos requisitos se cumplen con el número de volumen [12], que cambia sin problemas con el tiempo para que la selección (adición y eliminación) de los clientes para la conferencia sea elegante. Ln (=) es una función de la amplitud de la secuencia de audio actual más la actividad y amplitud sobre una ventana específica en el pasado. Fig. 3. Las diferentes ventanas utilizadas para calcular el número de volumen se actualizan en base a paquete por paquete. El parámetro básico utilizado aquí es la amplitud del paquete, que se calcula como el cuadrado medio de raíz (RMS) de las energías en muestras de audio de un paquete, y denotado por XK. Tres ventanas se definen como se muestra en la figura 3. El nivel de amplitud actual del altavoz se encuentra calculando el promedio móvil de amplitud de paquetes (XK) dentro de una ventana llamada ventana pasada reciente a partir del instante presente hasta algún momento pasado. La actividad pasada del altavoz se encuentra calculando el promedio móvil de la amplitud del paquete (XK) dentro de una ventana llamada ventana pasada distante, que comienza en el punto donde termina la ventana pasada reciente y se extiende hacia atrás en el pasado para un predefinidointervalo. La actividad del altavoz en el pasado se encuentra con una ventana llamada Activity Horizon, que abarca la ventana pasada reciente, así como la ventana pasada distante y más allá de lo necesario. Aunque la contribución del horizonte de la actividad se parece a la contribución de las ventanas pasadas pasadas y distantes recientes, la actividad pasada se calcula a partir de la ventana del horizonte de actividad de manera diferente. Defina las cantidades durante estos tres intervalos como L1, L2 y L3. L1 cuantifica la actividad del habla pasada reciente, L2 la actividad del habla pasada distante y L3 da un número correspondiente a la actividad del habla en la ventana del horizonte de actividad cuantificando cuán activo estaba el hablante en los últimos intervalos. L3 produce una cantidad que es proporcional a la fracción de paquetes que tienen energías por encima de un umbral predefinido (Ec. 3). El umbral es invariante entre los clientes.∑ + - = = 1 1 1 rpp p wt tk k rp x w l (1) ∑ +−− - = = 1 2 1 dprpp rpp wwt wtk k dp x w l (2) ∑ + - = ≥ = 1} {3 * 1AHP P K WT TK X AH I W L θθ (3) Donde ifi kx 1} {= ≥θ θ≥kx = de lo contrario, 0 el umbral es una constante.se establece en el 10-20 por ciento de la amplitud de las muestras de voz de un paquete en nuestra implementación aquí. El número de volumen λ para el presente instante de tiempo (o el paquete presente) se calcula como, 3322111*L*L*L αααλ ++ = (4) aquí se eligen 1 2 dqg 3 de tal manera que: 0 <1 21 2 dqg 3 = 1- 1 2) Aquí, 1 es el peso dado al discurso pasado reciente, 2 es el peso dado al discurso pasado lejano y 3 es el peso dado a la actividad del habla en elVentana de horizonte de actividad considerada.6.3 SEGURIDAD, LA VISIÓN Y ENA ESTADA El parámetro λ KDV VRPH PHPRU \\ GHSHQGLQJ RQ WKH VSUHDG RI LAS VENTANAS. Después de que un conmovedor se pone en silencio, otro puede tomar el piso. Además, como hay más de un canal, la interrupción está habilitada. Es más probable que se escuche un fuerte conmovedor debido a λ elevado. Esto asegura la equidad para todos los conmovedores. Después de todo, incluso en una conferencia cara a cara, un orador más vocal llama atención especial. Todas estas características deseables están integradas en el LN. Una discusión completa sobre la selección de los diversos parámetros y la dinámica de LN está más allá del alcance de este documento.6.4 Algoritmo de selección Uso del LN después de los desarrollos en las subsecciones 6.1 y 6.2, presentamos el algoritmo simple que se ejecuta en cada servidor de conferencia maestra (algoritmo 1). Este algoritmo se basa en las discusiones en la Sección 6.1. El set F globalmente único se encuentra utilizando este procedimiento. Repita para cada ranura de tiempo en cada M-CS {1. Obtenga todos los paquetes de los clientes que le pertenecen.2. Encuentre en la mayoría de los clientes NMAX que tienen PD [LPXP RXW RI 0 y OLHQWV LQ LWV GRPDLQ 3. Almacene una copia de los paquetes de esos clientes NMAX en la base de datos DB1.4. Envíe estos paquetes NMAX a otros M-CS (en unidifusión o multidifusión, dependiendo de la configuración).5. Del mismo modo, reciba paquetes de todos los demás M-CS y guárdelos en la base de datos DB2.6. Ahora compare los paquetes en DB1 y DB2 en WKH EDVLV RI DQG VHOHFW D PD [LPXP RI NMAX entre ellos (para formar el conjunto F) que debe reproducirse en cada cliente.7. Envíe los paquetes NMAX en el conjunto F a los clientes en su dominio.8. Mezcle estos paquetes de audio NMAX en el conjunto F después de linealizar y envíelo a clientes tontos en el dominio.} Algoritmo 1. Algoritmo de selección El mecanismo propuesto aquí también se representa en la Fig. 6, donde tiene lugar una sola conferencia entre tres dominios. Los clientes sombreados son los seleccionados en sus dominios locales;Sus transmisiones de audio se enviarán a otros CS.7. Problemas de implementación Ahora analizamos los problemas de implementación asociados con la gestión de la conferencia. ¿Cómo se organizarán los dominios para maximizar el número de participantes capaces de unirse? Para abordar esto, definimos algunos parámetros útiles.Sea D el número de dominios diferentes en los que hay clientes activos en una conferencia determinada.Sea MI el número de clientes activos presentes en el dominio I (DI ≤≤1) en una conferencia determinada. El número total de clientes activos en la conferencia es, por lo tanto, ∑ = = D I IMM 1.Sea C el número máximo de transmisiones de audio que un servidor de conferencias puede manejar en un tiempo de paquete, también llamado capacidad. C se establece de acuerdo con el poder de procesamiento de la CS más débil de la conferencia, pero como no se puede suponer que lo sabemos a-priori, se puede establecer de acuerdo con algún requisito mínimo del sistema que una máquina debe cumplir para participar en unconferencia.Deje que NMAX sea el número de transmisiones de salida que un CS tiene que enviar a otros CSS en dominios remotos (ver Sección 6.1). Estableceremos nmax = 3 (= | f |), según [15]. El problema de optimización ahora es encontrar el valor de D que maximiza el número total de clientes MI atendido por un CS en un dominio con capacidad C. Primero eliminamos el caso donde no se excede la capacidad (el CS existente no está sobrecargado),y luego proceda al caso donde existe la necesidad de crear más CSS cuando se sobrecarga una sola CS. Suponemos que los clientes están igualmente distribuidos entre los dominios, ya que es posible que no tengamos información para asumir una distribución A-Priori de los clientes. No podemos especificar más que un límite superior en el número de clientes aceptables, dado el número de dominios activos d.7.1 Conferencias con solo un nivel de CSS en esta subsección, consideramos que solo tenemos un CS, es decir, un M-CS único en cada dominio. Por lo tanto, no se puede sobrecargar. Consideramos que el sistema funciona como se describe en la Sección 6.1: los clientes envían sus paquetes de audio a sus CS locales, que selecciona transmisiones NMAX, antes de enviarlos a otros CS. Paralelamente, también recibe transmisiones NMAX para todos los demás CSS antes de tomar una decisión sobre la cual se seleccionarán, enviarán y jugarán Nmax Streams en cada cliente individual. Para la estabilidad del sistema, cualquier CS en la conferencia debería poder manejar a sus clientes locales además de los paquetes de audio de otros dominios. Claramente, entonces, la siguiente desigualdad debe mantener para cada dominio :) 1 (−⋅+≥ dn d m c max (5) El caso limitante de (5) (tomando la igualdad) toma la forma 2) (dndncm maxmax ⋅ --tim++= (6) Para optimizar D con respecto a m, establecemos 0) (2 = + - ⋅ger = ∂ ∂ Maxmax ncdn d m (7) produciendo    ⋅ ⋅ + = max max n nc d 2 (8) ([]* = redondeo al entero más cercano) y, por lo tanto, m de (6). C D M 50 9 234 100 17 884 150 26 1950 200 34 3434 250 42 5334 300 51 7650 350 59 10384 400 67 13534 450 76 17100 500 84 21084 Tabla 1. Valores de D y M calculados para algunos valores de C con nmax = 3. En la Tabla 1, damos los valores de D y M que se calcularon usando (8) y (6) con nmax = 3. Vemos que los valores de D y M, que dependen de C, se basan en la CS más débil. Vemos que hay una compensación entre M y D.Podríamos admitir más dominios en la conferencia, pero a expensas de restringir el número total de clientes en la conferencia. Al implementar y probar los servidores de conferencias en un Pentium III 1.4 GHz que ejecuta Windows NT, pudimos establecer C = 300. Pero con el advenimiento de computadoras más rápidas (> 3 GHz), se puede establecer fácilmente C en valores más altos y determinar D y M en consecuencia. La figura 4 muestra una gráfica de contorno y la Fig. 5, una malla 3D que muestra soluciones optimizadas para CSS de diferentes capacidades. Estos nos llevan a maximizar el número de dominios y, por lo tanto, a maximizar el número total de clientes en función de la capacidad de varios CS. En la Fig. 4, las curvas individuales representan el número total de clientes dirigidos, y seleccionamos un valor más bajo de D, para la capacidad C, para que la M dirigida reduzca el tráfico en WAN. La figura 5 representa una perspectiva diferente de los mismos datos en 3D. Fig. 4. Gráfico de contorno de capacidad versus número óptimo de dominios para varios tamaños de conferencia 7.2 Conferencias con dos niveles de CSS ahora considerando el caso en el que el número de clientes en un dominio en particular es demasiado grande, es decir, d m mi ≥ (9).La negación del servicio para nuevos clientes debido a la sobrecarga del servidor de conferencias. Este problema se puede resolver introduciendo un segundo nivel de CSS dentro del dominio dado, como en la figura 6. El M-CS existente crea un esclavo CS (S-CS) que puede manejar hasta los usuarios finales de C y al que transfiere a todos sus clientes activos. Aquí, el sistema funciona de manera diferente como se describe en la Sección 6.1: los clientes envían sus paquetes de audio a sus S-CS locales, que selecciona las transmisiones NMAX, antes de enviarlos a un M-CS local, que procederá de la misma manera, antes de enviarNMAX se transmite a los otros dominios. Cada S-CS recién creado debe ejecutarse en una máquina separada. El M-CS tiene que crear más S-CSS si el número de clientes activos excede C en el curso de la conferencia después de la transferencia. Con este mecanismo, el M-CS podrá crear el máximo     −⋅− = max max n dnc u) 1 (s-css, (10) como debe manejar 3 (= nmax) paquetes paracada paquetes locales S-CSS y 3 (= NMAX) de los demás dominios remotos. Luego podemos calcular el número teórico máximo de clientes activos Cumi ⋅ = en cada dominio, así como en M, para toda la conferencia como CUDM ⋅ger =. Fig. 5. Parcela 3D de capacidad versus número óptimo de dominios para varios tamaños de conferencia Por supuesto, uno podría crear aún más un tercer nivel en la jerarquía, dando la posibilidad de acomodar aún más clientes. Esto puede ser innecesario ya que el número de clientes posibles es lo suficientemente grande con dos niveles.8. Discusión de rendimiento Ahora analizamos el rendimiento del algoritmo presentado en la subsección 6.3, es decir, el que se encarga del intercambio de paquetes de audio entre los diferentes dominios. Tenga en cuenta que los paquetes que transitan dentro de la LAN aprovechan la mayor capacidad (generalmente junto con las capacidades de multidifusión) y, por lo tanto, no requieren un análisis de rendimiento. Por lo tanto, tenemos que mirar solo los paquetes RTP sobre la WAN, es decir, entre los M-CS participantes. Como cada M-CS de un dominio enviará solo NMAX de los paquetes D M a los otros CSS (Maxn D M >>), el ancho de banda utilizado por la aplicación sobre una WAN está ligada a la siguiente expresión. El número total de paquetes de audio que transitan sobre el WAN para cada ranura de tiempo es ∑ ∑ = ≠ =        d i d ijj maxn 1, 1 que es cuadrática en el número de dominios (es decir, o (d2))). Sin embargo, es independiente del número total de clientes activos. Este no habría sido el caso si todos los paquetes se hubieran enviado a través de la red en cada ranura de tiempo. El ahorro es tremendo. Sin embargo, uno puede sostener que enviar tres paquetes hacia y desde todos los dominios es un desperdicio de recursos, ya que la mayoría de estas transmisiones no serán seleccionadas. Si solo un cliente está activo, es innecesario seleccionar un subconjunto de clientes en ese dominio. Los algoritmos pesimistas y optimistas se presentan en la secuela apuntan a reducir aún más el tráfico al aprovechar la naturaleza lenta variable de la LN.8.1 Algoritmo pesimista Considere un escenario en el que el LN más bajo (llamado LNT) de las tres corrientes seleccionadas a nivel mundial (establecido F de la Sección 6.1) excede la LN de la corriente más dominante de un dominio. Evidentemente, las posibilidades de que las siguientes dos corrientes dominantes de ese dominio se seleccionen para F en el próximo período de paquete son menores. Aquí, enviamos esta transmisión más dominante y retenemos los otros dos. Puede haber un error en la selección única en todos los dominios solo para un período de paquete. Como LN varía lentamente, el error se rectificaría automáticamente en un período de paquete posterior (ranura). En este algoritmo, hay al menos una corriente en cada período. El tráfico de red neto en un período de paquete en el mejor de los casos es) 1 (−⋅ DD, es decir,) (2 do usando unicast, en lugar de maxndd ⋅ - p) 1 (. Se puede guardar un valioso ancho de banda valioso utilizando esta heurística. La complejidad del tráfico resultante se reduce de O (D2) a O (D) en redes habilitadas para multidifusión. Inicializar lnt = 0 en un M-CS/S-CS A. En la primera ranura (tiempo de paquete), cada CS envía las corrientes superiores de NMAX (según su LN) a todos los demás CS. En cada M-CS/S-CS y para cada hora del paquete: B. Encuentre el valor de LN más bajo de las transmisiones seleccionadas a nivel mundial de NMAX (SET F) desde la ranura de tiempo anterior. Establezca LNT con este valor. C. En cada dominio CS, seleccione las transmisiones locales de NMAX que tienen el máximo valor de LN (TOTOTHSS SET). D. Seleccione transmisiones que tienen ln> Lnt. Si hay> = transmisiones nmax con ln> lnt, envíe nmax superior a otros CSS. De lo contrario, si hay transmisiones (nmax-1) con Ln> Lnt, envíe la parte superior (nmax-1) más la más baja que LNT (es decir, NMAX superior) a otros CSS. De lo contrario, si hay transmisiones (nmax-2) con ln> lnt, envíe la parte superior (nmax-2) más la más baja que la lnt (es decir, la parte superior (nmax -1)) a otros CSS.…… de lo contrario si no hay transmisiones con ln> Lnt, envíe la transmisión top 1 a otros CSS. E. Paquetes enviados en el Paso D Formulario DB1. Los paquetes recibidos de otros CSS forman DB2. F. Para este intervalo de tiempo, encuentre transmisiones globales de NMAX basadas en LN de DB1 U DB2 (SET F) G. Envíe el conjunto F a los clientes en su dominio. Actualizar LNT para el próximo período. Algoritmo 2. Algoritmo pesimista para reducir la cantidad de paquetes enviados a través de Internet. Fig. 6. Ejemplo de una jerarquía de 2 niveles de servidores de conferencias;Los clientes sombreados son los seleccionados por el M-CS y se enviarán a otros dominios CSS. En este algoritmo, el ahorro en el tráfico es a costa de relajar la condición de formación del conjunto único globalmente único F. Sin embargo, las discrepancias en las corrientes seleccionadas en diferentes dominios permanecen por un corto período de tiempo, dependiendo del retraso de transporte entre dos dominios. Incluso para un retraso total de 400 ms, por solo 10 ranuras de tiempo de paquetes se pierde la singularidad. Esta duración en una conversación interactiva en tiempo real no es percibible por el oyente. En el caso de que haya una broma y cada uno se ríe, entonces habría un aumento repentino en el número de paquetes y sería delincuente por Maxn) d (o 2 por un período corto. 8.2 Algoritmo optimista El tráfico se puede reducirmás. El esquema en el siguiente algoritmo (algoritmo 3) es retener todas las corrientes que tienen menos valor de LN en comparación con los tres en el conjunto F. Podemos encontrar las tres corrientes correctas y únicas después de algunas ranuras de tiempo dependiendo deEl retraso de transporte entre los dominios. Como el período de paquete es del orden de 40 ms, el error en la selección es imposible de notar. El número de transmisiones en la red en este caso siempre está restringido a NMAX (= 3). Incluso sin detección de actividad de voz (VAD), no habrá más de tres transmisiones en la red en el mejor de los mejores casos, por lo que el tráfico total es constante. Una repentina explosión de tráfico, como se describe en 8.1, es un caso particular. Estas ventajas se deben a la explotación de las características de LN. Inicializar lnt = 0 en un M-CS/S-CS A. En la primera ranura (tiempo de paquete), cada CS envía las corrientes superiores de NMAX (según su LN) a todos los demás CS. En cada M-CS/S-CS y para cada hora del paquete: B. Encuentre el valor de LN más bajo de las transmisiones seleccionadas a nivel mundial de NMAX (SET F) desde la ranura de tiempo anterior. Establezca LNT con este valor. C. En cada dominio CS, seleccione las transmisiones locales de NMAX que tienen un valor máximo de LN (TootherCSS set) D. Seleccione flujos que tienen ln> lnt si hay> = transmisiones nmax con ln> lnt y luego envía nmax superior a otros CSS. De lo contrario, si hay transmisiones (nmax-1) con ln> lnt, envíe la parte superior (nmax-1) y vea E. de lo contrario si hay transmisiones (nmax-2) con ln> lnt, envíe la parte superior (nmax-2) y verE. …… de lo contrario si no hay transmisiones con ln> lnt, entonces no envíe ninguna transmisión. E. Excepciones: si la transmisión que estaba en F en el último intervalo pertenece a este CS, seleccione y envíe esa corriente incluso si su ln ahora es <lnt.(Tenga en cuenta que esto ocurre solo en esa CS que tenía la corriente que era la última de las tres en el período de paquete anterior). F. Paquetes enviados en el paso D y E Formulario DB1. Los paquetes recibidos de otros CSS forman DB2. G. Para este intervalo de tiempo, encuentre transmisiones globales de NMAX basadas en LN de DB1 U DB2 (SET F). H. Envíe el conjunto F a los clientes en su dominio. Actualizar LNT para el próximo período. Algoritmo 3. Algoritmo optimista Para reducir la cantidad de paquetes enviados a través de Internet Además, cuando se usa VAD [13], reduciría aún más el tráfico al enviar la parte del encabezado del paquete RTP solamente y no el paquete completo, por lo tanto, para seguir actualizandoel LN cruzó. El tráfico aquí en este caso es O (nmax) para multidifusión y o (d) para unicast. Vemos que los algoritmos anteriores guardan el ancho de banda y el cálculo en cada CS, y conduce a una arquitectura escalable con múltiples CSS principalmente porque los clientes se agrupan en dominios. El ancho de banda necesario no depende del número total de clientes activos. Como el CS siempre elige a los mejores tres clientes de todos los clientes asignados en el dominio, la adición de nuevos clientes a la conferencia existente no causará ningún problema de escalabilidad.8.3 Disponibilidad de multidifusión en la arquitectura que se ha propuesto, no se suponía que no se suponía sobre la disponibilidad de soporte de multidifusión de la red. El tráfico se reducirá aún más si hay multidifusión disponible sobre WAN. Es sencillo demostrar que el orden del tráfico tendería a convertirse en O (D) de O (D2). Esta es una aproximación ya que el ahorro en la multidifusión depende también de la topología. El análisis se realizó para el caso en el que la multidifusión no está disponible (una suposición realista en Internet de hoy). La ventaja de esta configuración es que podemos usarlo incluso si la multidifusión está parcialmente disponible. Podemos instruir a CSS durante la fase de configuración para enviar paquetes de unidifusión a aquellos CSS que no pueden recibir paquetes de multidifusión, mientras que CSS en enrutadores habilitados para multidifusión puede intercambiar paquetes en una dirección de multidifusión. Las estructuras de datos y los objetos de conferencia dentro de un CS se dan en [14]. Fig. 7. Interfaz de usuario para configurar el peso para las transmisiones de audio NMAX (configurar la auto-bar a cero evita el eco).8.4 Mejora de la calidad La mejora observada en la calidad percibida del servicio de la conferencia se debe a: (1) limitar el número de oradores concurrentes a un número bajo, como tres. En general, en una conferencia si más de dos participantes hablan la inteligibilidad se pierde. El análisis de conversación demuestra que habría un mecanismo de reparación [15] en tal caso.(2) Retraso: la transmisión de audio entre dos clientes pasará como máximo dos CSS, reduciendo así el retraso de extremo a extremo. Sin embargo, para una gran conferencia puede haber tres CSS, un salto está dentro del dominio que incurre en un retraso insignificante.(3) Como las transmisiones se mezclan solo en los clientes, puede haber una mezcla personalizada de las transmisiones. Se preserva el ajuste individual de mezclar con pesos el espacialismo. La figura 7 muestra la interfaz de usuario para la misma. El eco cuando se selecciona auto-transmisión se puede evitar reduciendo el peso. No obstante, la retroalimentación ayuda a tranquilizar al altavoz que todos los escuchan.9. Conclusión En este documento, hemos presentado una discusión sobre un entorno de conferencia virtual solo por voz. Hemos argumentado que la naturaleza distribuida de la implementación aquí la hace escalable. La interactividad se logra adaptando un esquema de selección de flujo reciente basado en el número de volumen. Además, incorporamos un resultado de un trabajo más reciente [15] donde se ha demostrado la suficiencia de tres altavoces simultáneos. Por lo tanto, existe una utilización significativamente efectiva del ancho de banda. Se juega una transmisión mixta en cada cliente;Cada cliente puede optar por tener una mezcla personalizada ya que la mezcla se realiza en la terminal local de cada cliente. Estos expresan un discurso improvisado en una teleconferencia virtual sobre la realidad de VoIP, como en una conferencia real en cara a cara. La compatibilidad se asegura gracias al uso de SIP, el protocolo de señalización más buscado. Para garantizar un rendimiento satisfactorio, no exigimos la disponibilidad de multidifusión, pero lo usamos si está disponible y cuándo está disponible. El tráfico en la WAN (Internet) está ligado a la parte superior por el cuadrado del número de dominios, reducido aún más mediante el uso de algoritmos heurísticos, que está muy por debajo del número total de clientes en la conferencia. Esto se debe al uso de un servidor de conferencia local para cada dominio. Las técnicas VAD ayudan a la reducción del tráfico. El uso de SIP Standard para la señalización hace que esta solución sea altamente interoperable. Hemos implementado una aplicación CS en una red de todo el campus. Creemos que esta nueva generación de entornos de conferencia virtual ganará más popularidad en el futuro, ya que su facilidad de implementación está segura gracias a tecnologías fácilmente disponibles y marcos escalables.10.

        "Audio and video conferencing on Internet are popular [25] for the several advantages they inhere [3,6].",
        "Clearly, the bandwidth required for a teleconference over the Internet increases rapidly with the number of participants; reducing bandwidth without compromising audio quality is a challenge in Internet Telephony.",
        "Additional critical issues are: (a) packet delay, (b) echo, (c) mixing of audio from selected clients, (d) automatic selection of clients to participate in the conference, (e) playout of mixed audio for every client, (f) handling clients not capable of mixing audio streams (such clients are known as dumb clients), and (g) deciding the number of simultaneously active clients in the conference without compromising voice quality.",

        "CHALLENGES IN VoIP CONFERENCING Many challenges arise in building a VoIP application.",
        "The following are of particular concern in the process: • Ease of use: Conferencing must be simple; users need no domain expertise.",
        "Management (addition/removal) of clients and servers must be uncomplicated.",
        "Application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers.",
        "Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies. • Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.",
        "Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.",
        "So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.",
        "Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition. • Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.",
        "The above requirements are placed in the perspective of observations made in earlier works (vide Sections 3 and 4) and will steer the VCE design. 3.",
        "THE MOTIVATION Ramanathan and Rangan [20] have studied in detail the architectural configurations comparing many conferencing architecture schemes taking into consideration the network delay and computation requirements for mixing.",
        "Functional division and object-oriented architecture design that aid in implementation is presented in [1].",
        "An overview of many issues involved in supporting a large conference is dealt in [8].",
        "H. P. Dommel [5] and many others highlight floor control as another pivotal aspect to be taken into account in designing a conferencing tool.",
        "Tightly coupled conference control protocols in Internet belong to the ITU-T H.323 family [9]; however, they are mainly for small conferences.",
        "The latest IETF draft by Rosenberg and Schulzrinne [23] discusses conferencing models with SIP [22] in the background.",
        "Aspects of implementation for centralized SIP conferencing are reported in [26].",
        "A new approach called partial mixing by Radenkovic [18] allows for mixed and non-mixed streams to coexist.",
        "In all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • In an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed.",
        "Actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech).",
        "The number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants.",
        "This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.",
        "Customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active.",
        "There is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality.",
        "Fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using Ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three.",
        "Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.",
        "This way, the conference becomes markedly artificial and its quality degrades.",
        "Schulzrinne et al. [24], assume only one participant is speaking at a time.",
        "In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes gagging for the users. • Partial mixing [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed.",
        "Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15]. • For large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up.",
        "With multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a clients network increases unnecessarily.",
        "Evidently, different particular issues, all of which are a subset of requirements (defined in [14] and [16]) for a VoIP conferencing support, are tackled.",
        "Thus there is a need to address conferencing as a whole with all its requirements considered concurrently.",
        "Towards this goal, the VoIP conferencing system we propose is intended to be scalable and interactive.",
        "We make use of the Loudness Number for implementing floor control.",
        "This permits a participant to freely get into the speaking mode to interrupt the current speaker as in a natural face-to-face meeting.",
        "An upper limit on the number of floors (i.e., the number of speakers allowed to speak at the same time) is fixed using a conjecture proposed in [15].",
        "The work presented here is in continuation of our studies into conferencing based on the Session Initiation Protocol in [14] and [16].",
        "SIP, defined in [22] is now the most popular standard for VoIP deployment and has been chosen for its strength, ease of use, extensibility and compatibility.",
        "This is the reason it will be in the background of all controlling messages that will implicitly arise between the entities in our architecture.",
        "The actual messages are described in [16] and, as such, we do not present a complete description of them here. 4.",
        "RELATED WORK The SIP standard defined in RFC 3261 [22] and in later extensions such as [21] does not offer conference control services such as floor control or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed.",
        "However SIP can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference control protocol.",
        "The core SIP specification supports many models for conferencing [26, 23].",
        "In the server-based models, a server mixes media streams, whereas in a server-less conference, mixing is done at the end systems.",
        "SDP [7] can be used to define media capabilities and provide other information about the conference.",
        "We shall now consider a few conference models in SIP that have been proposed recently [23].",
        "First, let us look into server-less models.",
        "In End-System Mixing, only one client (SIP UA) handles the signaling and media mixing for all the others, which is clearly not scalable and causes problems when that particular client leaves the conference.",
        "In the Users Joining model, a tree grows, as each invited party constitutes a new branch in the distribution path.",
        "This leads to an increasing number of hops for the remote leaves and is not scalable.",
        "Another option would be to use multicast for conferencing but multicast is not enabled over Internet and only possible on a LAN presently.",
        "Among server-based models, in a Dial-In Conference, UAs connect to a central server that handles all the mixing.",
        "This model is not scalable as it is limited by the processing power of the server and bandwidth of the network.",
        "Adhoc Centralized Conferences and Dial-Out Conference Servers have similar mechanisms and problems.",
        "Hybrid models involving centralized signaling and distributed media, with the latter using unicast or multicast, raise scalability problems as before.",
        "However an advantage is that the conference control can be a third party solution.",
        "Distributed Partial Mixing, presented in [18], proposes that in case of bandwidth limitation, some streams are mixed and some are not, leaving interactivity intact.",
        "Loss of spatialism when they mix and the bandwidth increase when they do not are open problems.",
        "A related study [19] by the same author proposes conferencing architecture for Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) but does not provide the scalability angle without the availability of multicasting.",
        "With the limitations of proposed conferencing systems in mind, we will now detail our proposal. 5.",
        "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE This section is dedicated to the description of the proposed system architecture.",
        "However, as this paper constitutes the continuation of our work started in [14] and furthered in [16], we will not present here all the details about the proposed entities and invite the readers to consult the papers mentioned above for a full and thorough description.",
        "First, we do not restrict our conferencing system to work on small conferences only, but rather on large audio VCEs that have hundreds (or even thousands) of users across a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet.",
        "This view stems from an appraisal that VCEs will gain in importance in the future, as interactive audio conferences will be more popular because of the spread of the media culture around the world.",
        "Two issues must be taken care of when building a VoIP conferencing system: (i) the front-end, consisting of the application program running on the end-users computers and (ii) the back-end that provides other application programs that facilitate conferencing and conference.",
        "The participating users are grouped into several domains.",
        "These domains are Local Area Networks (LANs), such as corporate or educational networks.",
        "This distributed assumption asks for distributed controlling and media handling solutions, as centralized systems would not scale for such very large conferences (vide Section 4).",
        "More explicitly, in each domain, we can identify several relevant logical components of a conferencing facility (Fig. 1):  An arbitrary number of end users (clients) that can take part in at most one audio conference at a time.",
        "Every user is Fig. 1.",
        "Conference example - 3 domains containing the necessary entities so that the conference can take place. included in one and only one domain at a given instant, but can move from domain to domain (nomadism).",
        "In our conferencing environment, these clients are regular SIP User Agents (SIP UAs), as defined in [22] so to gain in interoperability with other existing SIP-compatible systems.",
        "These clients are thus not aware of the complex setting that supports the conference and this is highlighted below.  One SIP Server (SIPS) per domain, taking care of all the signaling aspects of the conference (clients joining, leaving, etc.) [16].",
        "In particular, it is considered as a physical implementation encompassing different logical roles, namely a SIP Proxy Server, a SIP Registrar Server, a SIP Redirect Server and a SIP B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent) [22].",
        "This physical implementation enables the handling of incoming/outgoing SIP messages by one or another logical entity according to the needs.",
        "SIPS is entrusted with maintaining total service and has many advantages such as (a) it works as a centralized entity that can keep track of the activities of the UAs in a conference; (b) it can do all the switching for providing PBX features; (c) it can locate the UAs and invite them for a conference; (d) it can do the billing as well.",
        "SIPSs in different domains communicate with each other using SIP messages as described in [16].",
        "If the load on a particular SIPS is too heavy, it can create another SIPS in the same domain so that the load will be shared.  One Master Conference Server (M-CS) (simply a Conference Server (CS)) for each conference is created by the local SIPS when a conference starts.",
        "This server will be used for handling media packets for the clients of the domain.",
        "Its mechanism will be described in the next section.",
        "The M-CS will be able to create a hierarchy of CSs inside a domain by adding one or more Slave CSs (S-CSs) to accommodate all the active clients and prevent its own flooding at the same time.",
        "We will see this mechanism in some detail in the sequel.",
        "The entities described here are exhaustive and conform to the SIP philosophy.",
        "Thus, the use of SIP makes this architecture more useful and interoperable with any other SIP clients or servers. 6.",
        "ALGORITHMIC ISSUES 6.1 Selecting the Streams Similar to SipConf in [27], a Conference Server (CS) [17] has the function of supporting the conference; it is responsible for handling audio streams using RTP.",
        "It can also double to convert audio stream formats for a given client if necessary and can work as Translators/Mixers of RTP specification behind firewalls.",
        "We have based the design of our CS on H.323 Multipoint Processor (MP) [9].",
        "In short, the MP receives audio streams from the endpoints involved in a centralized or hybrid multipoint conference, processes them and returns them to the endpoints.",
        "An MP that processes audio prepares NMax audio outputs from M input streams after selection, mixing, or both.",
        "Audio mixing requires decoding the input audio to linear signals (PCM or analog), performing a linear combination of the signals and reencoding the result in an appropriate audio format.",
        "The MP may eliminate or attenuate some of the input signals in order to reduce noise and unwanted components.",
        "Fig. 2.",
        "Schematic diagram of a CS The limitation of H.323 is that it does not address the scalability of a conference.",
        "The architecture proposes a cascaded or daisy chain topology [10], which can be shown that it cannot scale up for a large conference.",
        "A CS serves many clients in the same conference.",
        "Thus it handles only one conference at a time.",
        "Multiple CSs may coexist in a domain, as when there are several conferences under way.",
        "Signaling-related messages of CSs are dealt in [11].",
        "The working of a CS is illustrated on Fig. 2: For each mixing interval, CS 1 chooses the best NMax audio packets out of the M1 (using a criterion termed Loudness Number, described in the next subsection).",
        "It may possibly receive and sends these to CSs 2 to P. The set of packets sent is denoted as ToOtherCSs.",
        "In the same mixing interval, it also receives the best NMax audio packets (out of possibly M2) from CS 2, similarly the best NMax (out of possibly MP) from CS P. For simplicity, we ignore propagation delay between CSs which indeed can be taken into account; it is beyond the scope of this presentation.",
        "The set of packets received is denoted as FromOtherCSs.",
        "Finally, it selects the best NMax packets from the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} and passes these packets to its own group.",
        "It can be seen that the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} is the same at all CSs.",
        "This ensures that any client in the conference finally receives the same set of packets for mixing.",
        "Hence all clients obtain a common view of the conference.",
        "Similarly, for each time slot (packet time), a subset, F of all clients is selected (using the same criterion) from the pool of packets from all other CSs plus the NMax clients selected locally.",
        "Their packets are mixed and played out at the clients.",
        "According to [15], the cardinality of F, |F| is NMax and is fixed at three.",
        "In our conferencing setup, selection is by the Master Conference Server (M-CS), which comes into the picture exclusively for media handling.",
        "Note that even if the SIP specification enables direct UA-to-UA media communication in a one-to-one call, it is also possible to use the Conference Server for two-party calls, especially because it is then more functional to create a real conference by adding a third and subsequently more participant(s).",
        "There are cases wherein the processing capacity of an M-CS is exceeded as it may have too many packets - from local domains and from remote domains - to process.",
        "In that case, the M-CS will create one or many S-CS (Fig. 6) and transfer its own clients as well as the new clients to them.",
        "In this configuration, the algorithm outlined above will be slightly modified, as the audio packets will go from clients to their dedicated S-CS that will select NMax packets to send to the local M-CS, which will then select NMax packets from all its S-CSs in the domain before sending them to the remote domains.",
        "The incoming packets from other domains will be received by the M-CS, select NMax of them and send them directly to the domain clients, bypassing the SCSs.",
        "This change implies that at most three intermediate entities exist for each audio packet, instead of two in the conventional setup.",
        "As the extra hop happens inside the LAN supposed to have a high-speed connectivity, we consider that it should not prevent us from using this hierarchy of CSs when theres a need to do so. 6.2 Loudness Number (LN) A basic question to be answered by the CS is the following.",
        "In a mixing interval, how should it choose NMax packets out of the M it might possibly receive?",
        "One way is to rank the M packets received according to their energies, and choose the top NMax.",
        "However, this is usually found to be inadequate because random fluctuations in packet energies can lead to poor audio quality.",
        "This indicates the need for a metric different from mere individual packet energies.",
        "The metric should have the following characteristics [12]: • A speaker (floor occupant) should not be cut off by a spike in the packet energy of another speaker.",
        "This implies that a speakers speech history should be given some weight.",
        "This is often referred to as Persistence or Hangover. • A participant who wants to interrupt a speaker will have to (i) speak loudly and (ii) keep trying for a little while.",
        "In a face-to-face conference, body language often indicates the intent to interrupt.",
        "But in a blind conference under discussion, a participants intention to interrupt can be conveyed effectively through LN.",
        "A floor control mechanism empowered to cut off a speaker forcefully must be ensured.",
        "These requirements are met by Loudness Number [12], which changes smoothly with time so that the selection (addition and deletion) of clients for conference is graceful.",
        "LN (= ) is a function of the amplitude of the current audio stream plus the activity and amplitude over a specific window in the past.",
        "Fig. 3.",
        "The different windows used for LN computation The Loudness Number is updated on a packet-by-packet basis.",
        "The basic parameter used here is packet amplitude, which is calculated as root mean square (rms) of the energies in audio samples of a packet, and denoted by XK.",
        "Three windows are defined as shown in Fig. 3.",
        "The present amplitude level of the speaker is found by calculating the moving average of packet amplitude (XK) within a window called Recent Past Window starting from the present instant to some past time.",
        "The past activity of the speaker is found by calculating the moving average of the packet amplitude (XK) within a window called Distant Past Window, which starts at the point where the Recent Past window ends and stretches back in the past for a pre-defined interval.",
        "The activity of the speaker in the past is found with a window called Activity Horizon, which spans the recent past window as well as the distant past window and beyond if necessary.",
        "Though the contribution of the activity horizon looks similar to the contribution of the recent past and distant past windows, past activity is computed from activity horizon window in a differently.",
        "Define the quantities during these three intervals as L1, L2 and L3.",
        "L1 quantifies the Recent Past speech activity, L2 the Distant Past speech activity and L3 gives a number corresponding to the speech activity in the Activity Horizon window quantifying how active the speaker was in the past few intervals.",
        "L3 yields a quantity that is proportional to the fraction of packets having energies above a pre-defined threshold (Eq. 3).",
        "The threshold is invariant across clients. ∑ +− = = 1 1 1 RPP P Wt tK K RP X W L (1) ∑ +−− −= = 1 2 1 DPRPP RPP WWt WtK K DP X W L (2) ∑ +− = ≥= 1 }{3 * 1 AHP P K Wt tK X AH I W L θθ (3) Where ifI KX 1}{ =≥θ θ≥KX = otherwise,0 The threshold is a constant. is set at 10-20 percent of the amplitude of the voice samples of a packet in our implementation here.",

        "Generally, in a conference if more than two participants speak the intelligibility is lost.",
        "The conversational analysis demonstrates that there would be a repair mechanism [15] in such a case. (2) Delay: The audio stream between any two clients will pass through at most two CSs thus reducing the end-to-end delay.",

        "Compatibility is assured thanks to the use of SIP, the most soughtafter signaling protocol.",
        "To ensure a satisfying performance, we do not demand the availability of multicast, but use it if and when available.",
        "The traffic in the WAN (Internet) is upper-bounded by the square of the number of domains, -- further reduced by using heuristic algorithms -- which is far below the total number of clients in the conference.",
        "This is due to the use of a Conference Server local to each domain.",
        "VAD techniques help further traffic reduction.",
        "Using SIP standard for signaling makes this solution highly interoperable.",
        "We have implemented a CS application on a campus-wide network.",

                "The set of packets received is denoted as FromOtherCSs.",
                "Finally, it selects the best NMax packets from the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} and passes these packets to its own group.",
                "It can be seen that the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} is the same at all CSs.",
                "This ensures that any client in the conference finally receives the same set of packets for mixing.",
                "Hence all clients obtain a common view of the conference.",

                "Note that even if the SIP specification enables direct UA-to-UA media communication in a one-to-one call, it is also possible to use the Conference Server for two-party calls, especially because it is then more functional to create a real conference by adding a third and subsequently more participant(s).",
                "There are cases wherein the processing capacity of an M-CS is exceeded as it may have too many packets - from local domains and from remote domains - to process.",
                "In that case, the M-CS will create one or many S-CS (Fig. 6) and transfer its own clients as well as the new clients to them.",
                "In this configuration, the algorithm outlined above will be slightly modified, as the audio packets will go from clients to their dedicated S-CS that will select NMax packets to send to the local M-CS, which will then select NMax packets from all its S-CSs in the domain before sending them to the remote domains.",
                "The incoming packets from other domains will be received by the M-CS, select NMax of them and send them directly to the domain clients, bypassing the SCSs.",

                "As the extra hop happens inside the LAN supposed to have a high-speed connectivity, we consider that it should not prevent us from using this hierarchy of CSs when theres a need to do so. 6.2 Loudness Number (LN) A basic question to be answered by the CS is the following.",
                "In a mixing interval, how should it choose NMax packets out of the M it might possibly receive?",
                "One way is to rank the M packets received according to their energies, and choose the top NMax.",
                "However, this is usually found to be inadequate because random fluctuations in packet energies can lead to poor audio quality.",
                "This indicates the need for a metric different from mere individual packet energies.",

                "Management (addition/removal) of clients and servers must be uncomplicated.",
                "Application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers.",
                "Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies. • Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.",
                "Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.",
                "So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.",
                "Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition. • Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.",
                "The above requirements are placed in the perspective of observations made in earlier works (vide Sections 3 and 4) and will steer the VCE design. 3.",
                "THE MOTIVATION Ramanathan and Rangan [20] have studied in detail the architectural configurations comparing many conferencing architecture schemes taking into consideration the network delay and computation requirements for mixing.",

                "A new approach called partial mixing by Radenkovic [18] allows for mixed and non-mixed streams to coexist.",
                "In all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • In an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed.",
                "Actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech).",
                "The number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants.",
                "This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.",
                "Customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active.",
                "There is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality.",
                "Fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using Ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three.",
                "Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.",
                "This way, the conference becomes markedly artificial and its quality degrades.",
                "Schulzrinne et al. [24], assume only one participant is speaking at a time.",
                "In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes gagging for the users. • Partial mixing [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed.",
                "Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15]. • For large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up.",
                "With multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a clients network increases unnecessarily.",
                "Evidently, different particular issues, all of which are a subset of requirements (defined in [14] and [16]) for a VoIP conferencing support, are tackled.",
                "Thus there is a need to address conferencing as a whole with all its requirements considered concurrently.",
                "Towards this goal, the VoIP conferencing system we propose is intended to be scalable and interactive.",
                "We make use of the Loudness Number for implementing floor control.",
                "This permits a participant to freely get into the speaking mode to interrupt the current speaker as in a natural face-to-face meeting.",
                "An upper limit on the number of floors (i.e., the number of speakers allowed to speak at the same time) is fixed using a conjecture proposed in [15].",
                "The work presented here is in continuation of our studies into conferencing based on the Session Initiation Protocol in [14] and [16].",
                "SIP, defined in [22] is now the most popular standard for VoIP deployment and has been chosen for its strength, ease of use, extensibility and compatibility.",
                "This is the reason it will be in the background of all controlling messages that will implicitly arise between the entities in our architecture.",
                "The actual messages are described in [16] and, as such, we do not present a complete description of them here. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK The SIP standard defined in RFC 3261 [22] and in later extensions such as [21] does not offer conference control services such as floor control or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed.",
                "However SIP can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference control protocol.",
                "The core SIP specification supports many models for conferencing [26, 23].",
                "In the server-based models, a server mixes media streams, whereas in a server-less conference, mixing is done at the end systems.",
                "SDP [7] can be used to define media capabilities and provide other information about the conference.",
                "We shall now consider a few conference models in SIP that have been proposed recently [23].",
                "First, let us look into server-less models.",
                "In End-System Mixing, only one client (SIP UA) handles the signaling and media mixing for all the others, which is clearly not scalable and causes problems when that particular client leaves the conference.",
                "In the Users Joining model, a tree grows, as each invited party constitutes a new branch in the distribution path.",
                "This leads to an increasing number of hops for the remote leaves and is not scalable.",
                "Another option would be to use multicast for conferencing but multicast is not enabled over Internet and only possible on a LAN presently.",
                "Among server-based models, in a Dial-In Conference, UAs connect to a central server that handles all the mixing.",
                "This model is not scalable as it is limited by the processing power of the server and bandwidth of the network.",
                "Adhoc Centralized Conferences and Dial-Out Conference Servers have similar mechanisms and problems.",
                "Hybrid models involving centralized signaling and distributed media, with the latter using unicast or multicast, raise scalability problems as before.",
                "However an advantage is that the conference control can be a third party solution.",
                "Distributed Partial Mixing, presented in [18], proposes that in case of bandwidth limitation, some streams are mixed and some are not, leaving interactivity intact.",
                "Loss of spatialism when they mix and the bandwidth increase when they do not are open problems.",
                "A related study [19] by the same author proposes conferencing architecture for Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) but does not provide the scalability angle without the availability of multicasting.",
                "With the limitations of proposed conferencing systems in mind, we will now detail our proposal. 5.",
                "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE This section is dedicated to the description of the proposed system architecture.",
                "However, as this paper constitutes the continuation of our work started in [14] and furthered in [16], we will not present here all the details about the proposed entities and invite the readers to consult the papers mentioned above for a full and thorough description.",
                "First, we do not restrict our conferencing system to work on small conferences only, but rather on large audio VCEs that have hundreds (or even thousands) of users across a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet.",
                "This view stems from an appraisal that VCEs will gain in importance in the future, as interactive audio conferences will be more popular because of the spread of the media culture around the world.",
                "Two issues must be taken care of when building a VoIP conferencing system: (i) the front-end, consisting of the application program running on the end-users computers and (ii) the back-end that provides other application programs that facilitate conferencing and conference.",
                "The participating users are grouped into several domains.",
                "These domains are Local Area Networks (LANs), such as corporate or educational networks.",
                "This distributed assumption asks for distributed controlling and media handling solutions, as centralized systems would not scale for such very large conferences (vide Section 4).",
                "More explicitly, in each domain, we can identify several relevant logical components of a conferencing facility (Fig. 1):  An arbitrary number of end users (clients) that can take part in at most one audio conference at a time.",
                "Every user is Fig. 1.",
                "Conference example - 3 domains containing the necessary entities so that the conference can take place. included in one and only one domain at a given instant, but can move from domain to domain (nomadism).",
                "In our conferencing environment, these clients are regular SIP User Agents (SIP UAs), as defined in [22] so to gain in interoperability with other existing SIP-compatible systems.",
                "These clients are thus not aware of the complex setting that supports the conference and this is highlighted below.  One SIP Server (SIPS) per domain, taking care of all the signaling aspects of the conference (clients joining, leaving, etc.) [16].",
                "In particular, it is considered as a physical implementation encompassing different logical roles, namely a SIP Proxy Server, a SIP Registrar Server, a SIP Redirect Server and a SIP B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent) [22].",
                "This physical implementation enables the handling of incoming/outgoing SIP messages by one or another logical entity according to the needs.",
                "SIPS is entrusted with maintaining total service and has many advantages such as (a) it works as a centralized entity that can keep track of the activities of the UAs in a conference; (b) it can do all the switching for providing PBX features; (c) it can locate the UAs and invite them for a conference; (d) it can do the billing as well.",
                "SIPSs in different domains communicate with each other using SIP messages as described in [16].",
                "If the load on a particular SIPS is too heavy, it can create another SIPS in the same domain so that the load will be shared.  One Master Conference Server (M-CS) (simply a Conference Server (CS)) for each conference is created by the local SIPS when a conference starts.",
                "This server will be used for handling media packets for the clients of the domain.",
                "Its mechanism will be described in the next section.",
                "The M-CS will be able to create a hierarchy of CSs inside a domain by adding one or more Slave CSs (S-CSs) to accommodate all the active clients and prevent its own flooding at the same time.",
                "We will see this mechanism in some detail in the sequel.",
                "The entities described here are exhaustive and conform to the SIP philosophy.",
                "Thus, the use of SIP makes this architecture more useful and interoperable with any other SIP clients or servers. 6.",
                "ALGORITHMIC ISSUES 6.1 Selecting the Streams Similar to SipConf in [27], a Conference Server (CS) [17] has the function of supporting the conference; it is responsible for handling audio streams using RTP.",
                "It can also double to convert audio stream formats for a given client if necessary and can work as Translators/Mixers of RTP specification behind firewalls.",
                "We have based the design of our CS on H.323 Multipoint Processor (MP) [9].",
                "In short, the MP receives audio streams from the endpoints involved in a centralized or hybrid multipoint conference, processes them and returns them to the endpoints.",
                "An MP that processes audio prepares NMax audio outputs from M input streams after selection, mixing, or both.",
                "Audio mixing requires decoding the input audio to linear signals (PCM or analog), performing a linear combination of the signals and reencoding the result in an appropriate audio format.",
                "The MP may eliminate or attenuate some of the input signals in order to reduce noise and unwanted components.",
                "Fig. 2.",
                "Schematic diagram of a CS The limitation of H.323 is that it does not address the scalability of a conference.",
                "The architecture proposes a cascaded or daisy chain topology [10], which can be shown that it cannot scale up for a large conference.",
                "A CS serves many clients in the same conference.",
                "Thus it handles only one conference at a time.",
                "Multiple CSs may coexist in a domain, as when there are several conferences under way.",
                "Signaling-related messages of CSs are dealt in [11].",
                "The working of a CS is illustrated on Fig. 2: For each mixing interval, CS 1 chooses the best NMax audio packets out of the M1 (using a criterion termed Loudness Number, described in the next subsection).",
                "It may possibly receive and sends these to CSs 2 to P. The set of packets sent is denoted as ToOtherCSs.",
                "In the same mixing interval, it also receives the best NMax audio packets (out of possibly M2) from CS 2, similarly the best NMax (out of possibly MP) from CS P. For simplicity, we ignore propagation delay between CSs which indeed can be taken into account; it is beyond the scope of this presentation.",
                "The set of packets received is denoted as FromOtherCSs.",
                "Finally, it selects the best NMax packets from the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} and passes these packets to its own group.",
                "It can be seen that the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} is the same at all CSs.",
                "This ensures that any client in the conference finally receives the same set of packets for mixing.",
                "Hence all clients obtain a common view of the conference.",
                "Similarly, for each time slot (packet time), a subset, F of all clients is selected (using the same criterion) from the pool of packets from all other CSs plus the NMax clients selected locally.",
                "Their packets are mixed and played out at the clients.",
                "According to [15], the cardinality of F, |F| is NMax and is fixed at three.",
                "In our conferencing setup, selection is by the Master Conference Server (M-CS), which comes into the picture exclusively for media handling.",
                "Note that even if the SIP specification enables direct UA-to-UA media communication in a one-to-one call, it is also possible to use the Conference Server for two-party calls, especially because it is then more functional to create a real conference by adding a third and subsequently more participant(s).",
                "There are cases wherein the processing capacity of an M-CS is exceeded as it may have too many packets - from local domains and from remote domains - to process.",
                "In that case, the M-CS will create one or many S-CS (Fig. 6) and transfer its own clients as well as the new clients to them.",
                "In this configuration, the algorithm outlined above will be slightly modified, as the audio packets will go from clients to their dedicated S-CS that will select NMax packets to send to the local M-CS, which will then select NMax packets from all its S-CSs in the domain before sending them to the remote domains.",
                "The incoming packets from other domains will be received by the M-CS, select NMax of them and send them directly to the domain clients, bypassing the SCSs.",
                "This change implies that at most three intermediate entities exist for each audio packet, instead of two in the conventional setup.",
                "As the extra hop happens inside the LAN supposed to have a high-speed connectivity, we consider that it should not prevent us from using this hierarchy of CSs when theres a need to do so. 6.2 Loudness Number (LN) A basic question to be answered by the CS is the following.",
                "In a mixing interval, how should it choose NMax packets out of the M it might possibly receive?",
                "One way is to rank the M packets received according to their energies, and choose the top NMax.",
                "However, this is usually found to be inadequate because random fluctuations in packet energies can lead to poor audio quality.",
                "This indicates the need for a metric different from mere individual packet energies.",
                "The metric should have the following characteristics [12]: • A speaker (floor occupant) should not be cut off by a spike in the packet energy of another speaker.",
                "This implies that a speakers speech history should be given some weight.",
                "This is often referred to as Persistence or Hangover. • A participant who wants to interrupt a speaker will have to (i) speak loudly and (ii) keep trying for a little while.",
                "In a face-to-face conference, body language often indicates the intent to interrupt.",
                "But in a blind conference under discussion, a participants intention to interrupt can be conveyed effectively through LN.",
                "A floor control mechanism empowered to cut off a speaker forcefully must be ensured.",
                "These requirements are met by Loudness Number [12], which changes smoothly with time so that the selection (addition and deletion) of clients for conference is graceful.",
                "LN (= ) is a function of the amplitude of the current audio stream plus the activity and amplitude over a specific window in the past.",
                "Fig. 3.",
                "The different windows used for LN computation The Loudness Number is updated on a packet-by-packet basis.",
                "The basic parameter used here is packet amplitude, which is calculated as root mean square (rms) of the energies in audio samples of a packet, and denoted by XK.",
                "Three windows are defined as shown in Fig. 3.",

                "Application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers.",
                "Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies. • Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.",
                "Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.",
                "So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.",
                "Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition. • Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.",

                "In all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • In an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed.",
                "Actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech).",
                "The number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants.",
                "This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.",
                "Customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active.",
                "There is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality.",
                "Fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using Ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three.",
                "Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.",
                "This way, the conference becomes markedly artificial and its quality degrades.",
                "Schulzrinne et al. [24], assume only one participant is speaking at a time.",
                "In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes gagging for the users. • Partial mixing [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed.",
                "Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15]. • For large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up.",
                "With multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a clients network increases unnecessarily.",
                "Evidently, different particular issues, all of which are a subset of requirements (defined in [14] and [16]) for a VoIP conferencing support, are tackled.",
                "Thus there is a need to address conferencing as a whole with all its requirements considered concurrently.",
                "Towards this goal, the VoIP conferencing system we propose is intended to be scalable and interactive.",
                "We make use of the Loudness Number for implementing floor control.",
                "This permits a participant to freely get into the speaking mode to interrupt the current speaker as in a natural face-to-face meeting.",
                "An upper limit on the number of floors (i.e., the number of speakers allowed to speak at the same time) is fixed using a conjecture proposed in [15].",
                "The work presented here is in continuation of our studies into conferencing based on the Session Initiation Protocol in [14] and [16].",
                "SIP, defined in [22] is now the most popular standard for VoIP deployment and has been chosen for its strength, ease of use, extensibility and compatibility.",
                "This is the reason it will be in the background of all controlling messages that will implicitly arise between the entities in our architecture.",
                "The actual messages are described in [16] and, as such, we do not present a complete description of them here. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK The SIP standard defined in RFC 3261 [22] and in later extensions such as [21] does not offer conference control services such as floor control or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed.",
                "However SIP can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference control protocol.",
                "The core SIP specification supports many models for conferencing [26, 23].",
                "In the server-based models, a server mixes media streams, whereas in a server-less conference, mixing is done at the end systems.",
                "SDP [7] can be used to define media capabilities and provide other information about the conference.",
                "We shall now consider a few conference models in SIP that have been proposed recently [23].",
                "First, let us look into server-less models.",
                "In End-System Mixing, only one client (SIP UA) handles the signaling and media mixing for all the others, which is clearly not scalable and causes problems when that particular client leaves the conference.",
                "In the Users Joining model, a tree grows, as each invited party constitutes a new branch in the distribution path.",
                "This leads to an increasing number of hops for the remote leaves and is not scalable.",
                "Another option would be to use multicast for conferencing but multicast is not enabled over Internet and only possible on a LAN presently.",
                "Among server-based models, in a Dial-In Conference, UAs connect to a central server that handles all the mixing.",
                "This model is not scalable as it is limited by the processing power of the server and bandwidth of the network.",
                "Adhoc Centralized Conferences and Dial-Out Conference Servers have similar mechanisms and problems.",
                "Hybrid models involving centralized signaling and distributed media, with the latter using unicast or multicast, raise scalability problems as before.",
                "However an advantage is that the conference control can be a third party solution.",
                "Distributed Partial Mixing, presented in [18], proposes that in case of bandwidth limitation, some streams are mixed and some are not, leaving interactivity intact.",
                "Loss of spatialism when they mix and the bandwidth increase when they do not are open problems.",
                "A related study [19] by the same author proposes conferencing architecture for Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) but does not provide the scalability angle without the availability of multicasting.",
                "With the limitations of proposed conferencing systems in mind, we will now detail our proposal. 5.",
                "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE This section is dedicated to the description of the proposed system architecture.",
                "However, as this paper constitutes the continuation of our work started in [14] and furthered in [16], we will not present here all the details about the proposed entities and invite the readers to consult the papers mentioned above for a full and thorough description.",
                "First, we do not restrict our conferencing system to work on small conferences only, but rather on large audio VCEs that have hundreds (or even thousands) of users across a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet.",
                "This view stems from an appraisal that VCEs will gain in importance in the future, as interactive audio conferences will be more popular because of the spread of the media culture around the world.",
                "Two issues must be taken care of when building a VoIP conferencing system: (i) the front-end, consisting of the application program running on the end-users computers and (ii) the back-end that provides other application programs that facilitate conferencing and conference.",
                "The participating users are grouped into several domains.",
                "These domains are Local Area Networks (LANs), such as corporate or educational networks.",
                "This distributed assumption asks for distributed controlling and media handling solutions, as centralized systems would not scale for such very large conferences (vide Section 4).",
                "More explicitly, in each domain, we can identify several relevant logical components of a conferencing facility (Fig. 1):  An arbitrary number of end users (clients) that can take part in at most one audio conference at a time.",
                "Every user is Fig. 1.",
                "Conference example - 3 domains containing the necessary entities so that the conference can take place. included in one and only one domain at a given instant, but can move from domain to domain (nomadism).",
                "In our conferencing environment, these clients are regular SIP User Agents (SIP UAs), as defined in [22] so to gain in interoperability with other existing SIP-compatible systems.",
                "These clients are thus not aware of the complex setting that supports the conference and this is highlighted below.  One SIP Server (SIPS) per domain, taking care of all the signaling aspects of the conference (clients joining, leaving, etc.) [16].",
                "In particular, it is considered as a physical implementation encompassing different logical roles, namely a SIP Proxy Server, a SIP Registrar Server, a SIP Redirect Server and a SIP B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent) [22].",
                "This physical implementation enables the handling of incoming/outgoing SIP messages by one or another logical entity according to the needs.",
                "SIPS is entrusted with maintaining total service and has many advantages such as (a) it works as a centralized entity that can keep track of the activities of the UAs in a conference; (b) it can do all the switching for providing PBX features; (c) it can locate the UAs and invite them for a conference; (d) it can do the billing as well.",
                "SIPSs in different domains communicate with each other using SIP messages as described in [16].",
                "If the load on a particular SIPS is too heavy, it can create another SIPS in the same domain so that the load will be shared.  One Master Conference Server (M-CS) (simply a Conference Server (CS)) for each conference is created by the local SIPS when a conference starts.",
                "This server will be used for handling media packets for the clients of the domain.",
                "Its mechanism will be described in the next section.",
                "The M-CS will be able to create a hierarchy of CSs inside a domain by adding one or more Slave CSs (S-CSs) to accommodate all the active clients and prevent its own flooding at the same time.",
                "We will see this mechanism in some detail in the sequel.",
                "The entities described here are exhaustive and conform to the SIP philosophy.",
                "Thus, the use of SIP makes this architecture more useful and interoperable with any other SIP clients or servers. 6.",
                "ALGORITHMIC ISSUES 6.1 Selecting the Streams Similar to SipConf in [27], a Conference Server (CS) [17] has the function of supporting the conference; it is responsible for handling audio streams using RTP.",
                "It can also double to convert audio stream formats for a given client if necessary and can work as Translators/Mixers of RTP specification behind firewalls.",
                "We have based the design of our CS on H.323 Multipoint Processor (MP) [9].",
                "In short, the MP receives audio streams from the endpoints involved in a centralized or hybrid multipoint conference, processes them and returns them to the endpoints.",
                "An MP that processes audio prepares NMax audio outputs from M input streams after selection, mixing, or both.",
                "Audio mixing requires decoding the input audio to linear signals (PCM or analog), performing a linear combination of the signals and reencoding the result in an appropriate audio format.",
                "The MP may eliminate or attenuate some of the input signals in order to reduce noise and unwanted components.",
                "Fig. 2.",
                "Schematic diagram of a CS The limitation of H.323 is that it does not address the scalability of a conference.",
                "The architecture proposes a cascaded or daisy chain topology [10], which can be shown that it cannot scale up for a large conference.",
                "A CS serves many clients in the same conference.",
                "Thus it handles only one conference at a time.",
                "Multiple CSs may coexist in a domain, as when there are several conferences under way.",
                "Signaling-related messages of CSs are dealt in [11].",
                "The working of a CS is illustrated on Fig. 2: For each mixing interval, CS 1 chooses the best NMax audio packets out of the M1 (using a criterion termed Loudness Number, described in the next subsection).",
                "It may possibly receive and sends these to CSs 2 to P. The set of packets sent is denoted as ToOtherCSs.",
                "In the same mixing interval, it also receives the best NMax audio packets (out of possibly M2) from CS 2, similarly the best NMax (out of possibly MP) from CS P. For simplicity, we ignore propagation delay between CSs which indeed can be taken into account; it is beyond the scope of this presentation.",
                "The set of packets received is denoted as FromOtherCSs.",
                "Finally, it selects the best NMax packets from the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} and passes these packets to its own group.",

                "This is an approximation as saving in multicasting depends also on the topology.",
                "The analysis was done for the case wherein multicast is not available (a realistic assumption in todays Internet).",

                "The conversational analysis demonstrates that there would be a repair mechanism [15] in such a case. (2) Delay: The audio stream between any two clients will pass through at most two CSs thus reducing the end-to-end delay.",

                "Thus, there is significantly effective utilization of bandwidth.",
                "A mixed stream is played out at each client; each client may choose to have a customized mix since mixing is done at the local terminal of each client.",

                "The traffic in the WAN (Internet) is upper-bounded by the square of the number of domains, -- further reduced by using heuristic algorithms -- which is far below the total number of clients in the conference.",
                "This is due to the use of a Conference Server local to each domain.",

                "Application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers.",
                "Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies. • Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.",
                "Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.",
                "So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.",
                "Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition. • Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.",
                "The above requirements are placed in the perspective of observations made in earlier works (vide Sections 3 and 4) and will steer the VCE design. 3.",

                "In all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • In an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed.",
                "Actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech).",
                "The number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants.",
                "This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.",
                "Customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active.",
                "There is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality.",
                "Fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using Ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three.",
                "Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.",
                "This way, the conference becomes markedly artificial and its quality degrades.",
                "Schulzrinne et al. [24], assume only one participant is speaking at a time.",
                "In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes gagging for the users. • Partial mixing [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed.",
                "Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15]. • For large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up.",
                "With multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a clients network increases unnecessarily.",
                "Evidently, different particular issues, all of which are a subset of requirements (defined in [14] and [16]) for a VoIP conferencing support, are tackled.",
                "Thus there is a need to address conferencing as a whole with all its requirements considered concurrently.",
                "Towards this goal, the VoIP conferencing system we propose is intended to be scalable and interactive.",
                "We make use of the Loudness Number for implementing floor control.",
                "This permits a participant to freely get into the speaking mode to interrupt the current speaker as in a natural face-to-face meeting.",
                "An upper limit on the number of floors (i.e., the number of speakers allowed to speak at the same time) is fixed using a conjecture proposed in [15].",
                "The work presented here is in continuation of our studies into conferencing based on the Session Initiation Protocol in [14] and [16].",
                "SIP, defined in [22] is now the most popular standard for VoIP deployment and has been chosen for its strength, ease of use, extensibility and compatibility.",
                "This is the reason it will be in the background of all controlling messages that will implicitly arise between the entities in our architecture.",
                "The actual messages are described in [16] and, as such, we do not present a complete description of them here. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK The SIP standard defined in RFC 3261 [22] and in later extensions such as [21] does not offer conference control services such as floor control or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed.",
                "However SIP can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference control protocol.",
                "The core SIP specification supports many models for conferencing [26, 23].",
                "In the server-based models, a server mixes media streams, whereas in a server-less conference, mixing is done at the end systems.",
                "SDP [7] can be used to define media capabilities and provide other information about the conference.",
                "We shall now consider a few conference models in SIP that have been proposed recently [23].",
                "First, let us look into server-less models.",
                "In End-System Mixing, only one client (SIP UA) handles the signaling and media mixing for all the others, which is clearly not scalable and causes problems when that particular client leaves the conference.",
                "In the Users Joining model, a tree grows, as each invited party constitutes a new branch in the distribution path.",
                "This leads to an increasing number of hops for the remote leaves and is not scalable.",
                "Another option would be to use multicast for conferencing but multicast is not enabled over Internet and only possible on a LAN presently.",
                "Among server-based models, in a Dial-In Conference, UAs connect to a central server that handles all the mixing.",
                "This model is not scalable as it is limited by the processing power of the server and bandwidth of the network.",
                "Adhoc Centralized Conferences and Dial-Out Conference Servers have similar mechanisms and problems.",
                "Hybrid models involving centralized signaling and distributed media, with the latter using unicast or multicast, raise scalability problems as before.",
                "However an advantage is that the conference control can be a third party solution.",
                "Distributed Partial Mixing, presented in [18], proposes that in case of bandwidth limitation, some streams are mixed and some are not, leaving interactivity intact.",
                "Loss of spatialism when they mix and the bandwidth increase when they do not are open problems.",
                "A related study [19] by the same author proposes conferencing architecture for Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) but does not provide the scalability angle without the availability of multicasting.",
                "With the limitations of proposed conferencing systems in mind, we will now detail our proposal. 5.",
                "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE This section is dedicated to the description of the proposed system architecture.",
                "However, as this paper constitutes the continuation of our work started in [14] and furthered in [16], we will not present here all the details about the proposed entities and invite the readers to consult the papers mentioned above for a full and thorough description.",
                "First, we do not restrict our conferencing system to work on small conferences only, but rather on large audio VCEs that have hundreds (or even thousands) of users across a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet.",
                "This view stems from an appraisal that VCEs will gain in importance in the future, as interactive audio conferences will be more popular because of the spread of the media culture around the world.",
                "Two issues must be taken care of when building a VoIP conferencing system: (i) the front-end, consisting of the application program running on the end-users computers and (ii) the back-end that provides other application programs that facilitate conferencing and conference.",
                "The participating users are grouped into several domains.",
                "These domains are Local Area Networks (LANs), such as corporate or educational networks.",
                "This distributed assumption asks for distributed controlling and media handling solutions, as centralized systems would not scale for such very large conferences (vide Section 4).",
                "More explicitly, in each domain, we can identify several relevant logical components of a conferencing facility (Fig. 1):  An arbitrary number of end users (clients) that can take part in at most one audio conference at a time.",
                "Every user is Fig. 1.",
                "Conference example - 3 domains containing the necessary entities so that the conference can take place. included in one and only one domain at a given instant, but can move from domain to domain (nomadism).",
                "In our conferencing environment, these clients are regular SIP User Agents (SIP UAs), as defined in [22] so to gain in interoperability with other existing SIP-compatible systems.",
                "These clients are thus not aware of the complex setting that supports the conference and this is highlighted below.  One SIP Server (SIPS) per domain, taking care of all the signaling aspects of the conference (clients joining, leaving, etc.) [16].",

                "Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies. • Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.",
                "Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.",
                "So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.",
                "Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition. • Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.",

                "Actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech).",
                "The number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants.",
                "This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.",
                "Customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active.",
                "There is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality.",
                "Fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using Ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three.",
                "Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.",

                "In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes gagging for the users. • Partial mixing [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed.",
                "Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15]. • For large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up.",
                "With multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a clients network increases unnecessarily.",

                "Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies. • Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.",
                "Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.",
                "So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.",
                "Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition. • Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.",

                "In all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • In an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed.",
                "Actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech).",
                "The number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants.",
                "This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.",
                "Customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active.",
                "There is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality.",
                "Fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using Ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three.",
                "Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.",
                "This way, the conference becomes markedly artificial and its quality degrades.",
                "Schulzrinne et al. [24], assume only one participant is speaking at a time.",
                "In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes gagging for the users. • <br>partial mixing</br> [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed.",
                "Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15]. • For large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up.",
                "With multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a clients network increases unnecessarily.",
                "Evidently, different particular issues, all of which are a subset of requirements (defined in [14] and [16]) for a VoIP conferencing support, are tackled.",
                "Thus there is a need to address conferencing as a whole with all its requirements considered concurrently.",
                "Towards this goal, the VoIP conferencing system we propose is intended to be scalable and interactive.",
                "We make use of the Loudness Number for implementing floor control.",
                "This permits a participant to freely get into the speaking mode to interrupt the current speaker as in a natural face-to-face meeting.",
                "An upper limit on the number of floors (i.e., the number of speakers allowed to speak at the same time) is fixed using a conjecture proposed in [15].",
                "The work presented here is in continuation of our studies into conferencing based on the Session Initiation Protocol in [14] and [16].",
                "SIP, defined in [22] is now the most popular standard for VoIP deployment and has been chosen for its strength, ease of use, extensibility and compatibility.",
                "This is the reason it will be in the background of all controlling messages that will implicitly arise between the entities in our architecture.",
                "The actual messages are described in [16] and, as such, we do not present a complete description of them here. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK The SIP standard defined in RFC 3261 [22] and in later extensions such as [21] does not offer conference control services such as floor control or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed.",
                "However SIP can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference control protocol.",
                "The core SIP specification supports many models for conferencing [26, 23].",
                "In the server-based models, a server mixes media streams, whereas in a server-less conference, mixing is done at the end systems.",
                "SDP [7] can be used to define media capabilities and provide other information about the conference.",
                "We shall now consider a few conference models in SIP that have been proposed recently [23].",
                "First, let us look into server-less models.",
                "In End-System Mixing, only one client (SIP UA) handles the signaling and media mixing for all the others, which is clearly not scalable and causes problems when that particular client leaves the conference.",
                "In the Users Joining model, a tree grows, as each invited party constitutes a new branch in the distribution path.",
                "This leads to an increasing number of hops for the remote leaves and is not scalable.",
                "Another option would be to use multicast for conferencing but multicast is not enabled over Internet and only possible on a LAN presently.",
                "Among server-based models, in a Dial-In Conference, UAs connect to a central server that handles all the mixing.",
                "This model is not scalable as it is limited by the processing power of the server and bandwidth of the network.",
                "Adhoc Centralized Conferences and Dial-Out Conference Servers have similar mechanisms and problems.",
                "Hybrid models involving centralized signaling and distributed media, with the latter using unicast or multicast, raise scalability problems as before.",
                "However an advantage is that the conference control can be a third party solution.",
                "Distributed <br>partial mixing</br>, presented in [18], proposes that in case of bandwidth limitation, some streams are mixed and some are not, leaving interactivity intact.",
                "Loss of spatialism when they mix and the bandwidth increase when they do not are open problems.",
                "A related study [19] by the same author proposes conferencing architecture for Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) but does not provide the scalability angle without the availability of multicasting.",
                "With the limitations of proposed conferencing systems in mind, we will now detail our proposal. 5.",
                "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE This section is dedicated to the description of the proposed system architecture.",
                "However, as this paper constitutes the continuation of our work started in [14] and furthered in [16], we will not present here all the details about the proposed entities and invite the readers to consult the papers mentioned above for a full and thorough description.",
                "First, we do not restrict our conferencing system to work on small conferences only, but rather on large audio VCEs that have hundreds (or even thousands) of users across a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet.",
                "This view stems from an appraisal that VCEs will gain in importance in the future, as interactive audio conferences will be more popular because of the spread of the media culture around the world.",
                "Two issues must be taken care of when building a VoIP conferencing system: (i) the front-end, consisting of the application program running on the end-users computers and (ii) the back-end that provides other application programs that facilitate conferencing and conference.",
                "The participating users are grouped into several domains.",
                "These domains are Local Area Networks (LANs), such as corporate or educational networks.",
                "This distributed assumption asks for distributed controlling and media handling solutions, as centralized systems would not scale for such very large conferences (vide Section 4).",
                "More explicitly, in each domain, we can identify several relevant logical components of a conferencing facility (Fig. 1):  An arbitrary number of end users (clients) that can take part in at most one audio conference at a time.",
                "Every user is Fig. 1.",
                "Conference example - 3 domains containing the necessary entities so that the conference can take place. included in one and only one domain at a given instant, but can move from domain to domain (nomadism).",
                "In our conferencing environment, these clients are regular SIP User Agents (SIP UAs), as defined in [22] so to gain in interoperability with other existing SIP-compatible systems.",
                "These clients are thus not aware of the complex setting that supports the conference and this is highlighted below.  One SIP Server (SIPS) per domain, taking care of all the signaling aspects of the conference (clients joining, leaving, etc.) [16].",
                "In particular, it is considered as a physical implementation encompassing different logical roles, namely a SIP Proxy Server, a SIP Registrar Server, a SIP Redirect Server and a SIP B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent) [22].",
                "This physical implementation enables the handling of incoming/outgoing SIP messages by one or another logical entity according to the needs.",
                "SIPS is entrusted with maintaining total service and has many advantages such as (a) it works as a centralized entity that can keep track of the activities of the UAs in a conference; (b) it can do all the switching for providing PBX features; (c) it can locate the UAs and invite them for a conference; (d) it can do the billing as well.",
                "SIPSs in different domains communicate with each other using SIP messages as described in [16].",
                "If the load on a particular SIPS is too heavy, it can create another SIPS in the same domain so that the load will be shared.  One Master Conference Server (M-CS) (simply a Conference Server (CS)) for each conference is created by the local SIPS when a conference starts.",
                "This server will be used for handling media packets for the clients of the domain.",
                "Its mechanism will be described in the next section.",
                "The M-CS will be able to create a hierarchy of CSs inside a domain by adding one or more Slave CSs (S-CSs) to accommodate all the active clients and prevent its own flooding at the same time.",
                "We will see this mechanism in some detail in the sequel.",
                "The entities described here are exhaustive and conform to the SIP philosophy.",
                "Thus, the use of SIP makes this architecture more useful and interoperable with any other SIP clients or servers. 6.",
                "ALGORITHMIC ISSUES 6.1 Selecting the Streams Similar to SipConf in [27], a Conference Server (CS) [17] has the function of supporting the conference; it is responsible for handling audio streams using RTP.",
                "It can also double to convert audio stream formats for a given client if necessary and can work as Translators/Mixers of RTP specification behind firewalls.",
                "We have based the design of our CS on H.323 Multipoint Processor (MP) [9].",
                "In short, the MP receives audio streams from the endpoints involved in a centralized or hybrid multipoint conference, processes them and returns them to the endpoints.",
                "An MP that processes audio prepares NMax audio outputs from M input streams after selection, mixing, or both.",
                "Audio mixing requires decoding the input audio to linear signals (PCM or analog), performing a linear combination of the signals and reencoding the result in an appropriate audio format.",

                "The working of a CS is illustrated on Fig. 2: For each mixing interval, CS 1 chooses the best NMax audio packets out of the M1 (using a criterion termed Loudness Number, described in the next subsection).",

                "In the same mixing interval, it also receives the best NMax audio packets (out of possibly M2) from CS 2, similarly the best NMax (out of possibly MP) from CS P.

                "The set of packets received is denoted as FromOtherCSs.",

                "This ensures that any client in the conference finally receives the same set of packets for mixing.",

                "Thus, there is significantly effective utilization of bandwidth.",
                "A mixed stream is played out at each client; each client may choose to have a customized mix since mixing is done at the local terminal of each client.",

                "The traffic in the WAN (Internet) is upper-bounded by the square of the number of domains, -- further reduced by using heuristic algorithms -- which is far below the total number of clients in the conference.",

                "Application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers.",
                "Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies. • Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.",
                "Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.",
                "So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.",
                "Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition. • Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.",

                "In all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • In an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed.",
                "Actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech).",
                "The number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants.",
                "This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.",
                "Customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active.",
                "There is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality.",
                "Fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using Ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three.",
                "Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.",
                "This way, the conference becomes markedly artificial and its quality degrades.",
                "Schulzrinne et al. [24], assume only one participant is speaking at a time.",
                "In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes gagging for the users. • Partial mixing [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed.",
                "Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15]. • For large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up.",
                "With multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a clients network increases unnecessarily.",
                "Evidently, different particular issues, all of which are a subset of requirements (defined in [14] and [16]) for a VoIP conferencing support, are tackled.",
                "Thus there is a need to address conferencing as a whole with all its requirements considered concurrently.",
                "Towards this goal, the VoIP conferencing system we propose is intended to be scalable and interactive.",
                "We make use of the Loudness Number for implementing floor control.",

                "The work presented here is in continuation of our studies into conferencing based on the Session Initiation Protocol in [14] and [16].",
                "SIP, defined in [22] is now the most popular standard for VoIP deployment and has been chosen for its strength, ease of use, extensibility and compatibility.",
                "This is the reason it will be in the background of all controlling messages that will implicitly arise between the entities in our architecture.",
                "The actual messages are described in [16] and, as such, we do not present a complete description of them here. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK The SIP standard defined in RFC 3261 [22] and in later extensions such as [21] does not offer conference control services such as floor control or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed.",
                "However SIP can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference control protocol.",
                "The core SIP specification supports many models for conferencing [26, 23].",
                "In the server-based models, a server mixes media streams, whereas in a server-less conference, mixing is done at the end systems.",
                "SDP [7] can be used to define media capabilities and provide other information about the conference.",
                "We shall now consider a few conference models in SIP that have been proposed recently [23].",
                "First, let us look into server-less models.",
                "In End-System Mixing, only one client (SIP UA) handles the signaling and media mixing for all the others, which is clearly not scalable and causes problems when that particular client leaves the conference.",
                "In the Users Joining model, a tree grows, as each invited party constitutes a new branch in the distribution path.",
                "This leads to an increasing number of hops for the remote leaves and is not scalable.",
                "Another option would be to use multicast for conferencing but multicast is not enabled over Internet and only possible on a LAN presently.",
                "Among server-based models, in a Dial-In Conference, UAs connect to a central server that handles all the mixing.",
                "This model is not scalable as it is limited by the processing power of the server and bandwidth of the network.",
                "Adhoc Centralized Conferences and Dial-Out Conference Servers have similar mechanisms and problems.",
                "Hybrid models involving centralized signaling and distributed media, with the latter using unicast or multicast, raise scalability problems as before.",
                "However an advantage is that the conference control can be a third party solution.",
                "Distributed Partial Mixing, presented in [18], proposes that in case of bandwidth limitation, some streams are mixed and some are not, leaving interactivity intact.",
                "Loss of spatialism when they mix and the bandwidth increase when they do not are open problems.",
                "A related study [19] by the same author proposes conferencing architecture for Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) but does not provide the scalability angle without the availability of multicasting.",
                "With the limitations of proposed conferencing systems in mind, we will now detail our proposal. 5.",
                "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE This section is dedicated to the description of the proposed system architecture.",
                "However, as this paper constitutes the continuation of our work started in [14] and furthered in [16], we will not present here all the details about the proposed entities and invite the readers to consult the papers mentioned above for a full and thorough description.",
                "First, we do not restrict our conferencing system to work on small conferences only, but rather on large audio VCEs that have hundreds (or even thousands) of users across a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet.",
                "This view stems from an appraisal that VCEs will gain in importance in the future, as interactive audio conferences will be more popular because of the spread of the media culture around the world.",
                "Two issues must be taken care of when building a VoIP conferencing system: (i) the front-end, consisting of the application program running on the end-users computers and (ii) the back-end that provides other application programs that facilitate conferencing and conference.",
                "The participating users are grouped into several domains.",
                "These domains are Local Area Networks (LANs), such as corporate or educational networks.",
                "This distributed assumption asks for distributed controlling and media handling solutions, as centralized systems would not scale for such very large conferences (vide Section 4).",
                "More explicitly, in each domain, we can identify several relevant logical components of a conferencing facility (Fig. 1):  An arbitrary number of end users (clients) that can take part in at most one audio conference at a time.",
                "Every user is Fig. 1.",
                "Conference example - 3 domains containing the necessary entities so that the conference can take place. included in one and only one domain at a given instant, but can move from domain to domain (nomadism).",

                "Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.",
                "So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.",

                "This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.",

                "Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.",

                "It can be seen that the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} is the same at all CSs.",
                "This ensures that any client in the conference finally receives the same set of packets for mixing.",

                "Note that even if the SIP specification enables direct UA-to-UA media communication in a one-to-one call, it is also possible to use the Conference Server for two-party calls, especially because it is then more functional to create a real conference by adding a third and subsequently more participant(s).",

                "In this configuration, the algorithm outlined above will be slightly modified, as the audio packets will go from clients to their dedicated S-CS that will select NMax packets to send to the local M-CS, which will then select NMax packets from all its S-CSs in the domain before sending them to the remote domains.",

                "In a mixing interval, how should it choose NMax packets out of the M it might possibly receive?",
                "One way is to rank the M packets received according to their energies, and choose the top NMax.",
                "However, this is usually found to be inadequate because random fluctuations in packet energies can lead to poor audio quality.",
                "This indicates the need for a metric different from mere individual packet energies.",
                "The metric should have the following characteristics [12]: • A speaker (floor occupant) should not be cut off by a spike in the packet energy of another speaker.",

                "Application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers.",
                "Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies. • Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.",
                "Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.",
                "So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.",
                "Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition. • Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.",
                "The above requirements are placed in the perspective of observations made in earlier works (vide Sections 3 and 4) and will steer the <br>vce</br> design. 3.",

                "A new approach called partial mixing by Radenkovic [18] allows for mixed and non-mixed streams to coexist.",
                "In all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • In an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed.",
                "Actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech).",
                "The number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants.",
                "This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.",
                "Customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active.",
                "There is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality.",
                "Fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using Ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three.",
                "Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.",
                "This way, the conference becomes markedly artificial and its quality degrades.",
                "Schulzrinne et al. [24], assume only one participant is speaking at a time.",
                "In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes gagging for the users. • Partial mixing [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed.",
                "Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15]. • For large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up.",
                "With multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a clients network increases unnecessarily.",
                "Evidently, different particular issues, all of which are a subset of requirements (defined in [14] and [16]) for a VoIP conferencing support, are tackled.",
                "Thus there is a need to address conferencing as a whole with all its requirements considered concurrently.",
                "Towards this goal, the VoIP conferencing system we propose is intended to be scalable and interactive.",
                "We make use of the Loudness Number for implementing floor control.",
                "This permits a participant to freely get into the speaking mode to interrupt the current speaker as in a natural face-to-face meeting.",
                "An upper limit on the number of floors (i.e., the number of speakers allowed to speak at the same time) is fixed using a conjecture proposed in [15].",
                "The work presented here is in continuation of our studies into conferencing based on the Session Initiation Protocol in [14] and [16].",
                "SIP, defined in [22] is now the most popular standard for VoIP deployment and has been chosen for its strength, ease of use, extensibility and compatibility.",
                "This is the reason it will be in the background of all controlling messages that will implicitly arise between the entities in our architecture.",
                "The actual messages are described in [16] and, as such, we do not present a complete description of them here. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK The SIP standard defined in RFC 3261 [22] and in later extensions such as [21] does not offer conference control services such as floor control or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed.",
                "However SIP can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference control protocol.",
                "The core SIP specification supports many models for conferencing [26, 23].",
                "In the server-based models, a server mixes media streams, whereas in a server-less conference, mixing is done at the end systems.",
                "SDP [7] can be used to define media capabilities and provide other information about the conference.",
                "We shall now consider a few conference models in SIP that have been proposed recently [23].",
                "First, let us look into server-less models.",
                "In End-System Mixing, only one client (SIP UA) handles the signaling and media mixing for all the others, which is clearly not scalable and causes problems when that particular client leaves the conference.",
                "In the Users Joining model, a tree grows, as each invited party constitutes a new branch in the distribution path.",
                "This leads to an increasing number of hops for the remote leaves and is not scalable.",
                "Another option would be to use multicast for conferencing but multicast is not enabled over Internet and only possible on a LAN presently.",
                "Among server-based models, in a Dial-In Conference, UAs connect to a central server that handles all the mixing.",
                "This model is not scalable as it is limited by the processing power of the server and bandwidth of the network.",
                "Adhoc Centralized Conferences and Dial-Out Conference Servers have similar mechanisms and problems.",
                "Hybrid models involving centralized signaling and distributed media, with the latter using unicast or multicast, raise scalability problems as before.",
                "However an advantage is that the conference control can be a third party solution.",
                "Distributed Partial Mixing, presented in [18], proposes that in case of bandwidth limitation, some streams are mixed and some are not, leaving interactivity intact.",
                "Loss of spatialism when they mix and the bandwidth increase when they do not are open problems.",
                "A related study [19] by the same author proposes conferencing architecture for Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) but does not provide the scalability angle without the availability of multicasting.",
                "With the limitations of proposed conferencing systems in mind, we will now detail our proposal. 5.",
                "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE This section is dedicated to the description of the proposed system architecture.",
                "However, as this paper constitutes the continuation of our work started in [14] and furthered in [16], we will not present here all the details about the proposed entities and invite the readers to consult the papers mentioned above for a full and thorough description.",
                "First, we do not restrict our conferencing system to work on small conferences only, but rather on large audio VCEs that have hundreds (or even thousands) of users across a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet.",
                "This view stems from an appraisal that VCEs will gain in importance in the future, as interactive audio conferences will be more popular because of the spread of the media culture around the world.",
                "Two issues must be taken care of when building a VoIP conferencing system: (i) the front-end, consisting of the application program running on the end-users computers and (ii) the back-end that provides other application programs that facilitate conferencing and conference.",
                "The participating users are grouped into several domains.",
                "These domains are Local Area Networks (LANs), such as corporate or educational networks.",
                "This distributed assumption asks for distributed controlling and media handling solutions, as centralized systems would not scale for such very large conferences (vide Section 4).",
                "More explicitly, in each domain, we can identify several relevant logical components of a conferencing facility (Fig. 1):  An arbitrary number of end users (clients) that can take part in at most one audio conference at a time.",
                "Every user is Fig. 1.",
                "Conference example - 3 domains containing the necessary entities so that the conference can take place. included in one and only one domain at a given instant, but can move from domain to domain (nomadism).",
                "In our conferencing environment, these clients are regular SIP User Agents (SIP UAs), as defined in [22] so to gain in interoperability with other existing SIP-compatible systems.",
                "These clients are thus not aware of the complex setting that supports the conference and this is highlighted below.  One SIP Server (SIPS) per domain, taking care of all the signaling aspects of the conference (clients joining, leaving, etc.) [16].",
                "In particular, it is considered as a physical implementation encompassing different logical roles, namely a SIP Proxy Server, a SIP Registrar Server, a SIP Redirect Server and a SIP B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent) [22].",
                "This physical implementation enables the handling of incoming/outgoing SIP messages by one or another logical entity according to the needs.",
                "SIPS is entrusted with maintaining total service and has many advantages such as (a) it works as a centralized entity that can keep track of the activities of the UAs in a conference; (b) it can do all the switching for providing PBX features; (c) it can locate the UAs and invite them for a conference; (d) it can do the billing as well.",
                "SIPSs in different domains communicate with each other using SIP messages as described in [16].",
                "If the load on a particular SIPS is too heavy, it can create another SIPS in the same domain so that the load will be shared.  One Master Conference Server (M-CS) (simply a Conference Server (CS)) for each conference is created by the local SIPS when a conference starts.",
                "This server will be used for handling media packets for the clients of the domain.",
                "Its mechanism will be described in the next section.",
                "The M-CS will be able to create a hierarchy of CSs inside a domain by adding one or more Slave CSs (S-CSs) to accommodate all the active clients and prevent its own flooding at the same time.",
                "We will see this mechanism in some detail in the sequel.",
                "The entities described here are exhaustive and conform to the SIP philosophy.",
                "Thus, the use of SIP makes this architecture more useful and interoperable with any other SIP clients or servers. 6.",
                "ALGORITHMIC ISSUES 6.1 Selecting the Streams Similar to SipConf in [27], a Conference Server (CS) [17] has the function of supporting the conference; it is responsible for handling audio streams using RTP.",
                "It can also double to convert audio stream formats for a given client if necessary and can work as Translators/Mixers of RTP specification behind firewalls.",
                "We have based the design of our CS on H.323 Multipoint Processor (MP) [9].",
                "In short, the MP receives audio streams from the endpoints involved in a centralized or hybrid multipoint conference, processes them and returns them to the endpoints.",
                "An MP that processes audio prepares NMax audio outputs from M input streams after selection, mixing, or both.",
                "Audio mixing requires decoding the input audio to linear signals (PCM or analog), performing a linear combination of the signals and reencoding the result in an appropriate audio format.",
                "The MP may eliminate or attenuate some of the input signals in order to reduce noise and unwanted components.",
                "Fig. 2.",
                "Schematic diagram of a CS The limitation of H.323 is that it does not address the scalability of a conference.",
                "The architecture proposes a cascaded or daisy chain topology [10], which can be shown that it cannot scale up for a large conference.",
                "A CS serves many clients in the same conference.",
                "Thus it handles only one conference at a time.",
                "Multiple CSs may coexist in a domain, as when there are several conferences under way.",
                "Signaling-related messages of CSs are dealt in [11].",
                "The working of a CS is illustrated on Fig. 2: For each mixing interval, CS 1 chooses the best NMax audio packets out of the M1 (using a criterion termed Loudness Number, described in the next subsection).",
                "It may possibly receive and sends these to CSs 2 to P. The set of packets sent is denoted as ToOtherCSs.",
                "In the same mixing interval, it also receives the best NMax audio packets (out of possibly M2) from CS 2, similarly the best NMax (out of possibly MP) from CS P. For simplicity, we ignore propagation delay between CSs which indeed can be taken into account; it is beyond the scope of this presentation.",
                "The set of packets received is denoted as FromOtherCSs.",
                "Finally, it selects the best NMax packets from the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} and passes these packets to its own group.",
                "It can be seen that the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} is the same at all CSs.",
                "This ensures that any client in the conference finally receives the same set of packets for mixing.",
                "Hence all clients obtain a common view of the conference.",
                "Similarly, for each time slot (packet time), a subset, F of all clients is selected (using the same criterion) from the pool of packets from all other CSs plus the NMax clients selected locally.",
                "Their packets are mixed and played out at the clients.",
                "According to [15], the cardinality of F, |F| is NMax and is fixed at three.",
                "In our conferencing setup, selection is by the Master Conference Server (M-CS), which comes into the picture exclusively for media handling.",
                "Note that even if the SIP specification enables direct UA-to-UA media communication in a one-to-one call, it is also possible to use the Conference Server for two-party calls, especially because it is then more functional to create a real conference by adding a third and subsequently more participant(s).",
                "There are cases wherein the processing capacity of an M-CS is exceeded as it may have too many packets - from local domains and from remote domains - to process.",

                "For a large conference there might be three CSs however, one hop is within the domain incurring negligible delay. (3) As the streams are mixed only at the clients, there can be a customized mix of the streams.",

                "Thus, there is significantly effective utilization of bandwidth.",
                "A mixed stream is played out at each client; each client may choose to have a customized mix since mixing is done at the local terminal of each client.",
                "These render impromptu speech in a virtual teleconference over VoIP a reality, as in a real face-to-face conference.",
                "Compatibility is assured thanks to the use of SIP, the most soughtafter signaling protocol.",
                "To ensure a satisfying performance, we do not demand the availability of multicast, but use it if and when available.",
                "The traffic in the WAN (Internet) is upper-bounded by the square of the number of domains, -- further reduced by using heuristic algorithms -- which is far below the total number of clients in the conference.",
                "This is due to the use of a Conference Server local to each domain.",
                "VAD techniques help further traffic reduction.",

                "Application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers.",
                "Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies. • Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.",
                "Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.",
                "So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.",
                "Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition. • Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.",

                "A new approach called partial mixing by Radenkovic [18] allows for mixed and non-mixed streams to coexist.",
                "In all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • In an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed.",
                "Actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech).",
                "The number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants.",
                "This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.",
                "Customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active.",
                "There is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality.",
                "Fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using Ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three.",
                "Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.",
                "This way, the conference becomes markedly artificial and its quality degrades.",
                "Schulzrinne et al. [24], assume only one participant is speaking at a time.",
                "In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes gagging for the users. • Partial mixing [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed.",
                "Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15]. • For large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up.",
                "With multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a clients network increases unnecessarily.",
                "Evidently, different particular issues, all of which are a subset of requirements (defined in [14] and [16]) for a <br>voip</br> conferencing support, are tackled.",
                "Thus there is a need to address conferencing as a whole with all its requirements considered concurrently.",
                "Towards this goal, the <br>voip</br> conferencing system we propose is intended to be scalable and interactive.",
                "We make use of the Loudness Number for implementing floor control.",
                "This permits a participant to freely get into the speaking mode to interrupt the current speaker as in a natural face-to-face meeting.",
                "An upper limit on the number of floors (i.e., the number of speakers allowed to speak at the same time) is fixed using a conjecture proposed in [15].",
                "The work presented here is in continuation of our studies into conferencing based on the Session Initiation Protocol in [14] and [16].",
                "SIP, defined in [22] is now the most popular standard for <br>voip</br> deployment and has been chosen for its strength, ease of use, extensibility and compatibility.",
                "This is the reason it will be in the background of all controlling messages that will implicitly arise between the entities in our architecture.",
                "The actual messages are described in [16] and, as such, we do not present a complete description of them here. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK The SIP standard defined in RFC 3261 [22] and in later extensions such as [21] does not offer conference control services such as floor control or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed.",
                "However SIP can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference control protocol.",
                "The core SIP specification supports many models for conferencing [26, 23].",
                "In the server-based models, a server mixes media streams, whereas in a server-less conference, mixing is done at the end systems.",
                "SDP [7] can be used to define media capabilities and provide other information about the conference.",
                "We shall now consider a few conference models in SIP that have been proposed recently [23].",
                "First, let us look into server-less models.",
                "In End-System Mixing, only one client (SIP UA) handles the signaling and media mixing for all the others, which is clearly not scalable and causes problems when that particular client leaves the conference.",
                "In the Users Joining model, a tree grows, as each invited party constitutes a new branch in the distribution path.",
                "This leads to an increasing number of hops for the remote leaves and is not scalable.",
                "Another option would be to use multicast for conferencing but multicast is not enabled over Internet and only possible on a LAN presently.",
                "Among server-based models, in a Dial-In Conference, UAs connect to a central server that handles all the mixing.",
                "This model is not scalable as it is limited by the processing power of the server and bandwidth of the network.",
                "Adhoc Centralized Conferences and Dial-Out Conference Servers have similar mechanisms and problems.",
                "Hybrid models involving centralized signaling and distributed media, with the latter using unicast or multicast, raise scalability problems as before.",
                "However an advantage is that the conference control can be a third party solution.",
                "Distributed Partial Mixing, presented in [18], proposes that in case of bandwidth limitation, some streams are mixed and some are not, leaving interactivity intact.",
                "Loss of spatialism when they mix and the bandwidth increase when they do not are open problems.",
                "A related study [19] by the same author proposes conferencing architecture for Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) but does not provide the scalability angle without the availability of multicasting.",
                "With the limitations of proposed conferencing systems in mind, we will now detail our proposal. 5.",
                "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE This section is dedicated to the description of the proposed system architecture.",
                "However, as this paper constitutes the continuation of our work started in [14] and furthered in [16], we will not present here all the details about the proposed entities and invite the readers to consult the papers mentioned above for a full and thorough description.",
                "First, we do not restrict our conferencing system to work on small conferences only, but rather on large audio VCEs that have hundreds (or even thousands) of users across a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet.",
                "This view stems from an appraisal that VCEs will gain in importance in the future, as interactive audio conferences will be more popular because of the spread of the media culture around the world.",
                "Two issues must be taken care of when building a <br>voip</br> conferencing system: (i) the front-end, consisting of the application program running on the end-users computers and (ii) the back-end that provides other application programs that facilitate conferencing and conference.",
                "The participating users are grouped into several domains.",
                "These domains are Local Area Networks (LANs), such as corporate or educational networks.",
                "This distributed assumption asks for distributed controlling and media handling solutions, as centralized systems would not scale for such very large conferences (vide Section 4).",
                "More explicitly, in each domain, we can identify several relevant logical components of a conferencing facility (Fig. 1):  An arbitrary number of end users (clients) that can take part in at most one audio conference at a time.",
                "Every user is Fig. 1.",
                "Conference example - 3 domains containing the necessary entities so that the conference can take place. included in one and only one domain at a given instant, but can move from domain to domain (nomadism).",
                "In our conferencing environment, these clients are regular SIP User Agents (SIP UAs), as defined in [22] so to gain in interoperability with other existing SIP-compatible systems.",
                "These clients are thus not aware of the complex setting that supports the conference and this is highlighted below.  One SIP Server (SIPS) per domain, taking care of all the signaling aspects of the conference (clients joining, leaving, etc.) [16].",
                "In particular, it is considered as a physical implementation encompassing different logical roles, namely a SIP Proxy Server, a SIP Registrar Server, a SIP Redirect Server and a SIP B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent) [22].",
                "This physical implementation enables the handling of incoming/outgoing SIP messages by one or another logical entity according to the needs.",
                "SIPS is entrusted with maintaining total service and has many advantages such as (a) it works as a centralized entity that can keep track of the activities of the UAs in a conference; (b) it can do all the switching for providing PBX features; (c) it can locate the UAs and invite them for a conference; (d) it can do the billing as well.",
                "SIPSs in different domains communicate with each other using SIP messages as described in [16].",

                "The conversational analysis demonstrates that there would be a repair mechanism [15] in such a case. (2) Delay: The audio stream between any two clients will pass through at most two CSs thus reducing the end-to-end delay.",

                "Thus, there is significantly effective utilization of bandwidth.",
                "A mixed stream is played out at each client; each client may choose to have a customized mix since mixing is done at the local terminal of each client.",
                "These render impromptu speech in a virtual teleconference over <br>voip</br> a reality, as in a real face-to-face conference.",

                "To ensure a satisfying performance, we do not demand the availability of multicast, but use it if and when available.",
                "The traffic in the WAN (Internet) is upper-bounded by the square of the number of domains, -- further reduced by using heuristic algorithms -- which is far below the total number of clients in the conference.",
                "This is due to the use of a Conference Server local to each domain.",
                "VAD techniques help further traffic reduction.",

                "The set of packets received is denoted as FromOtherCSs.",

                "It can be seen that the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} is the same at all CSs.",
                "This ensures that any client in the conference finally receives the same set of packets for mixing.",

                "Note that even if the SIP specification enables direct UA-to-UA media communication in a one-to-one call, it is also possible to use the Conference Server for two-party calls, especially because it is then more functional to create a real conference by adding a third and subsequently more participant(s).",

                "In this configuration, the algorithm outlined above will be slightly modified, as the audio packets will go from clients to their dedicated S-CS that will select NMax packets to send to the local M-CS, which will then select NMax packets from all its S-CSs in the domain before sending them to the remote domains.",

                "In a mixing interval, how should it choose NMax packets out of the M it might possibly receive?",
                "One way is to rank the M packets received according to their energies, and choose the top NMax.",

For simplicity, we ignore propagation delay between CSs which indeed can be taken into account; it is beyond the scope of this presentation.",
                "The set of packets received is denoted as FromOtherCSs.",
                "Finally, it selects the best NMax packets from the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} and passes these packets to its own group.",
                "It can be seen that the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} is the same at all CSs.",
                "This ensures that any client in the conference finally receives the same set of packets for mixing.",
                "Hence all clients obtain a common view of the conference.",

                "Note that even if the SIP specification enables direct UA-to-UA media communication in a one-to-one call, it is also possible to use the Conference Server for two-party calls, especially because it is then more functional to create a real conference by adding a third and subsequently more participant(s).",
                "There are cases wherein the processing capacity of an M-CS is exceeded as it may have too many packets - from local domains and from remote domains - to process.",
                "In that case, the M-CS will create one or many S-CS (Fig. 6) and transfer its own clients as well as the new clients to them.",
                "In this configuration, the algorithm outlined above will be slightly modified, as the audio packets will go from clients to their dedicated S-CS that will select NMax packets to send to the local M-CS, which will then select NMax packets from all its S-CSs in the domain before sending them to the remote domains.",
                "The incoming packets from other domains will be received by the M-CS, select NMax of them and send them directly to the domain clients, bypassing the SCSs.",

                "As the extra hop happens inside the LAN supposed to have a high-speed connectivity, we consider that it should not prevent us from using this hierarchy of CSs when theres a need to do so. 6.2 Loudness Number (LN) A basic question to be answered by the CS is the following.",
                "In a mixing interval, how should it choose NMax packets out of the M it might possibly receive?",
                "One way is to rank the M packets received according to their energies, and choose the top NMax.",
                "However, this is usually found to be inadequate because random fluctuations in packet energies can lead to poor audio quality.",

                "Application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers.",
                "Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies. • Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.",
                "Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.",
                "So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications. • Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a real conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.",
                "Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition. • Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.",
                "The above requirements are placed in the perspective of observations made in earlier works (vide Sections 3 and 4) and will steer the VCE design. 3.",

                "A new approach called partial mixing by Radenkovic [18] allows for mixed and non-mixed streams to coexist.",
                "In all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • In an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed.",
                "Actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech).",
                "The number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants.",
                "This would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.",
                "Customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active.",
                "There is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality.",
                "Fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using Ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three.",
                "Thus it is advisable to honour that constraint. • There cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, Conference Servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus. • Floor Control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.",
                "This way, the conference becomes markedly artificial and its quality degrades.",
                "Schulzrinne et al. [24], assume only one participant is speaking at a time.",
                "In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes gagging for the users. • Partial mixing [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed.",
                "Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15]. • For large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up.",
                "With multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a clients network increases unnecessarily.",
                "Evidently, different particular issues, all of which are a subset of requirements (defined in [14] and [16]) for a VoIP conferencing support, are tackled.",
                "Thus there is a need to address conferencing as a whole with all its requirements considered concurrently.",
                "Towards this goal, the VoIP conferencing system we propose is intended to be scalable and interactive.",
                "We make use of the Loudness Number for implementing floor control.",
                "This permits a participant to freely get into the speaking mode to interrupt the current speaker as in a natural face-to-face meeting.",
                "An upper limit on the number of floors (i.e., the number of speakers allowed to speak at the same time) is fixed using a conjecture proposed in [15].",
                "The work presented here is in continuation of our studies into conferencing based on the Session Initiation Protocol in [14] and [16].",
                "<br>sip</br>, defined in [22] is now the most popular standard for VoIP deployment and has been chosen for its strength, ease of use, extensibility and compatibility.",
                "This is the reason it will be in the background of all controlling messages that will implicitly arise between the entities in our architecture.",
                "The actual messages are described in [16] and, as such, we do not present a complete description of them here. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK The <br>sip</br> standard defined in RFC 3261 [22] and in later extensions such as [21] does not offer conference control services such as floor control or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed.",
                "However <br>sip</br> can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference control protocol.",
                "The core <br>sip</br> specification supports many models for conferencing [26, 23].",
                "In the server-based models, a server mixes media streams, whereas in a server-less conference, mixing is done at the end systems.",
                "SDP [7] can be used to define media capabilities and provide other information about the conference.",
                "We shall now consider a few conference models in <br>sip</br> that have been proposed recently [23].",
                "First, let us look into server-less models.",
                "In End-System Mixing, only one client (<br>sip</br> UA) handles the signaling and media mixing for all the others, which is clearly not scalable and causes problems when that particular client leaves the conference.",
                "In the Users Joining model, a tree grows, as each invited party constitutes a new branch in the distribution path.",
                "This leads to an increasing number of hops for the remote leaves and is not scalable.",
                "Another option would be to use multicast for conferencing but multicast is not enabled over Internet and only possible on a LAN presently.",
                "Among server-based models, in a Dial-In Conference, UAs connect to a central server that handles all the mixing.",
                "This model is not scalable as it is limited by the processing power of the server and bandwidth of the network.",
                "Adhoc Centralized Conferences and Dial-Out Conference Servers have similar mechanisms and problems.",
                "Hybrid models involving centralized signaling and distributed media, with the latter using unicast or multicast, raise scalability problems as before.",
                "However an advantage is that the conference control can be a third party solution.",
                "Distributed Partial Mixing, presented in [18], proposes that in case of bandwidth limitation, some streams are mixed and some are not, leaving interactivity intact.",
                "Loss of spatialism when they mix and the bandwidth increase when they do not are open problems.",
                "A related study [19] by the same author proposes conferencing architecture for Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) but does not provide the scalability angle without the availability of multicasting.",
                "With the limitations of proposed conferencing systems in mind, we will now detail our proposal. 5.",
                "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE This section is dedicated to the description of the proposed system architecture.",
                "However, as this paper constitutes the continuation of our work started in [14] and furthered in [16], we will not present here all the details about the proposed entities and invite the readers to consult the papers mentioned above for a full and thorough description.",
                "First, we do not restrict our conferencing system to work on small conferences only, but rather on large audio VCEs that have hundreds (or even thousands) of users across a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet.",
                "This view stems from an appraisal that VCEs will gain in importance in the future, as interactive audio conferences will be more popular because of the spread of the media culture around the world.",
                "Two issues must be taken care of when building a VoIP conferencing system: (i) the front-end, consisting of the application program running on the end-users computers and (ii) the back-end that provides other application programs that facilitate conferencing and conference.",
                "The participating users are grouped into several domains.",
                "These domains are Local Area Networks (LANs), such as corporate or educational networks.",
                "This distributed assumption asks for distributed controlling and media handling solutions, as centralized systems would not scale for such very large conferences (vide Section 4).",
                "More explicitly, in each domain, we can identify several relevant logical components of a conferencing facility (Fig. 1):  An arbitrary number of end users (clients) that can take part in at most one audio conference at a time.",
                "Every user is Fig. 1.",
                "Conference example - 3 domains containing the necessary entities so that the conference can take place. included in one and only one domain at a given instant, but can move from domain to domain (nomadism).",
                "In our conferencing environment, these clients are regular <br>sip</br> User Agents (<br>sip</br> UAs), as defined in [22] so to gain in interoperability with other existing SIP-compatible systems.",
                "These clients are thus not aware of the complex setting that supports the conference and this is highlighted below.  One <br>sip</br> Server (SIPS) per domain, taking care of all the signaling aspects of the conference (clients joining, leaving, etc.) [16].",
                "In particular, it is considered as a physical implementation encompassing different logical roles, namely a <br>sip</br> Proxy Server, a <br>sip</br> Registrar Server, a SIP Redirect Server and a SIP B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent) [22].",
                "This physical implementation enables the handling of incoming/outgoing <br>sip</br> messages by one or another logical entity according to the needs.",
                "SIPS is entrusted with maintaining total service and has many advantages such as (a) it works as a centralized entity that can keep track of the activities of the UAs in a conference; (b) it can do all the switching for providing PBX features; (c) it can locate the UAs and invite them for a conference; (d) it can do the billing as well.",
                "SIPSs in different domains communicate with each other using <br>sip</br> messages as described in [16].",
                "If the load on a particular SIPS is too heavy, it can create another SIPS in the same domain so that the load will be shared.  One Master Conference Server (M-CS) (simply a Conference Server (CS)) for each conference is created by the local SIPS when a conference starts.",
                "This server will be used for handling media packets for the clients of the domain.",
                "Its mechanism will be described in the next section.",
                "The M-CS will be able to create a hierarchy of CSs inside a domain by adding one or more Slave CSs (S-CSs) to accommodate all the active clients and prevent its own flooding at the same time.",
                "We will see this mechanism in some detail in the sequel.",
                "The entities described here are exhaustive and conform to the <br>sip</br> philosophy.",
                "Thus, the use of <br>sip</br> makes this architecture more useful and interoperable with any other <br>sip</br> clients or servers. 6.",
                "ALGORITHMIC ISSUES 6.1 Selecting the Streams Similar to SipConf in [27], a Conference Server (CS) [17] has the function of supporting the conference; it is responsible for handling audio streams using RTP.",
                "It can also double to convert audio stream formats for a given client if necessary and can work as Translators/Mixers of RTP specification behind firewalls.",
                "We have based the design of our CS on H.323 Multipoint Processor (MP) [9].",
                "In short, the MP receives audio streams from the endpoints involved in a centralized or hybrid multipoint conference, processes them and returns them to the endpoints.",
                "An MP that processes audio prepares NMax audio outputs from M input streams after selection, mixing, or both.",
                "Audio mixing requires decoding the input audio to linear signals (PCM or analog), performing a linear combination of the signals and reencoding the result in an appropriate audio format.",
                "The MP may eliminate or attenuate some of the input signals in order to reduce noise and unwanted components.",
                "Fig. 2.",
                "Schematic diagram of a CS The limitation of H.323 is that it does not address the scalability of a conference.",
                "The architecture proposes a cascaded or daisy chain topology [10], which can be shown that it cannot scale up for a large conference.",
                "A CS serves many clients in the same conference.",
                "Thus it handles only one conference at a time.",
                "Multiple CSs may coexist in a domain, as when there are several conferences under way.",
                "Signaling-related messages of CSs are dealt in [11].",
                "The working of a CS is illustrated on Fig. 2: For each mixing interval, CS 1 chooses the best NMax audio packets out of the M1 (using a criterion termed Loudness Number, described in the next subsection).",
                "It may possibly receive and sends these to CSs 2 to P. The set of packets sent is denoted as ToOtherCSs.",
                "In the same mixing interval, it also receives the best NMax audio packets (out of possibly M2) from CS 2, similarly the best NMax (out of possibly MP) from CS P. For simplicity, we ignore propagation delay between CSs which indeed can be taken into account; it is beyond the scope of this presentation.",
                "The set of packets received is denoted as FromOtherCSs.",
                "Finally, it selects the best NMax packets from the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} and passes these packets to its own group.",
                "It can be seen that the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} is the same at all CSs.",
                "This ensures that any client in the conference finally receives the same set of packets for mixing.",
                "Hence all clients obtain a common view of the conference.",
                "Similarly, for each time slot (packet time), a subset, F of all clients is selected (using the same criterion) from the pool of packets from all other CSs plus the NMax clients selected locally.",
                "Their packets are mixed and played out at the clients.",
                "According to [15], the cardinality of F, |F| is NMax and is fixed at three.",
                "In our conferencing setup, selection is by the Master Conference Server (M-CS), which comes into the picture exclusively for media handling.",
                "Note that even if the <br>sip</br> specification enables direct UA-to-UA media communication in a one-to-one call, it is also possible to use the Conference Server for two-party calls, especially because it is then more functional to create a real conference by adding a third and subsequently more participant(s).",
                "There are cases wherein the processing capacity of an M-CS is exceeded as it may have too many packets - from local domains and from remote domains - to process.",
                "In that case, the M-CS will create one or many S-CS (Fig. 6) and transfer its own clients as well as the new clients to them.",
                "In this configuration, the algorithm outlined above will be slightly modified, as the audio packets will go from clients to their dedicated S-CS that will select NMax packets to send to the local M-CS, which will then select NMax packets from all its S-CSs in the domain before sending them to the remote domains.",
                "The incoming packets from other domains will be received by the M-CS, select NMax of them and send them directly to the domain clients, bypassing the SCSs.",
                "This change implies that at most three intermediate entities exist for each audio packet, instead of two in the conventional setup.",
                "As the extra hop happens inside the LAN supposed to have a high-speed connectivity, we consider that it should not prevent us from using this hierarchy of CSs when theres a need to do so. 6.2 Loudness Number (LN) A basic question to be answered by the CS is the following.",
                "In a mixing interval, how should it choose NMax packets out of the M it might possibly receive?",
                "One way is to rank the M packets received according to their energies, and choose the top NMax.",
                "However, this is usually found to be inadequate because random fluctuations in packet energies can lead to poor audio quality.",
                "This indicates the need for a metric different from mere individual packet energies.",
                "The metric should have the following characteristics [12]: • A speaker (floor occupant) should not be cut off by a spike in the packet energy of another speaker.",
                "This implies that a speakers speech history should be given some weight.",
                "This is often referred to as Persistence or Hangover. • A participant who wants to interrupt a speaker will have to (i) speak loudly and (ii) keep trying for a little while.",
                "In a face-to-face conference, body language often indicates the intent to interrupt.",
                "But in a blind conference under discussion, a participants intention to interrupt can be conveyed effectively through LN.",
                "A floor control mechanism empowered to cut off a speaker forcefully must be ensured.",
                "These requirements are met by Loudness Number [12], which changes smoothly with time so that the selection (addition and deletion) of clients for conference is graceful.",
                "LN (= ) is a function of the amplitude of the current audio stream plus the activity and amplitude over a specific window in the past.",
                "Fig. 3.",
                "The different windows used for LN computation The Loudness Number is updated on a packet-by-packet basis.",
