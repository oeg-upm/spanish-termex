In order to appropriately order and structure the negotiations occurring in the chain so as to optimize the expected utility, we present an extension to a singleagent concurrent negotiation framework. This work is aimed at semi-cooperative multi-agent systems, where each agent has its own goals and works to maximize its local utility; however, the performance of each individual agent is tightly related to other agents cooperation and the systems overall performance. We introduce a pre-negotiation phase that allows agents to transfer meta-level information. Using this information, the agent can build a more accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the relationship of flexibility and success probability. This more accurate model helps the agent in choosing a better negotiation solution in the global negotiation chain context. The agent can also use this information to allocate appropriate time for each negotiation, hence to find a good ordering of all related negotiations. The experimental data shows that these mechanisms improve the agents and the systems overall performance significantly.

INTRODUCTION Sophisticated negotiation for task and resource allocation is crucial for the next generation of multi-agent systems (MAS) applications. Groups of agents need to efficiently negotiate over multiple related issues concurrently in a complex, distributed setting where there are deadlines by which the negotiations must be completed. This is an important research area where there has been very little work done. This work is aimed at semi-cooperative multi-agent systems, where each agent has its own goals and works to maximize its local utility; however, the performance of each individual agent is tightly related to other agents cooperation and the systems overall performance. There is no single global goal in such systems, either because each agent represents a different organization/user, or because it is difficult/impossible to design one single global goal. This issue arises due to multiple concurrent tasks, resource constrains and uncertainties, and thus no agent has sufficient knowledge or computational resources to determine what is best for the whole system [11]. An example of such a system would be a virtual organization [12] (i.e. a supply chain) dynamically formed in an electronic marketplace such as the one developed by the CONOISE project [5]. To accomplish tasks continuously arriving in the virtual organization, cooperation and sub-task relocation are needed and preferred. There is no single global goal since each agent may be involved in multiple virtual organizations. Meanwhile, the performance of each individual agent is tightly related to other agents cooperation and the virtual organizations overall performance. The negotiation in such systems is not a zero-sum game, a deal that increases both agents utilities can be found through efficient negotiation. Additionally, there are multiple encounters among agents since new tasks are arriving all the time. In such negotiations, price may or may not be important, since it can be fixed resulting from a long-term contract. Other factors like quality and delivery time are important too. Reputation mechanisms in the system makes cheating not attractive from a long term viewpoint due to multiple encounters among agents. In such systems, agents are self-interested because they primarily focus on their own goals; but they are also semi-cooperative, meaning they are willing to be truthful and collaborate with other agents to find solutions that are beneficial to all participants, including itself; though it wont voluntarily scarify its own utility in exchange of others benefits. Another major difference between this work and other work on negotiation is that negotiation, here, is not viewed as a stand-alone process. Rather it is one part of the agents activity which is tightly interleaved with the planning, scheduling and executing of the agents activities, which also may relate to other negotiations. Based on this recognition, this work on negotiation is concerned more about the meta-level decision-making process in negotiation rather than the basic protocols or languages. The goal of this research is to develop a set of macro-strategies that allow the agents to effectively manage multiple related negotiations, including, but not limited to the following issues: how much time should be spent on each negotiation, how much flexibility (see formal definition in Formula 3) should be allocated for each negotiation, and in what order should 50 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS the negotiations be performed. These macro-strategies are different from those micro-strategies that direct the individual negotiation thread, such as whether the agent should concede and how much the agent should concede, etc[3]. In this paper we extend a multi-linked negotiation model [10] from a single-agent perspective to a multi-agent perspective, so that a group of agents involved in chains of interrelated negotiations can find nearly-optimal macro negotiation strategies for pursuing their negotiations. The remainder of this paper is structured in the following manner. Section 2 describes the basic negotiation process and briefly reviews a single agents model of multi-linked negotiation. Section 3 introduces a complex supply-chain scenario. Section 4 details how to solve those problems arising in the negotiation chain. Section 5 reports on the experimental work. Section 6 discusses related work and Section 7 presents conclusions and areas of future work. 2. BACKGROUND ON MULTI-LINKED NEGOTIATION In this work, the negotiation process between any pair of agents is based on an extended version of the contract net [6]: the initiator agent announces the proposal including multiple features; the responding agent evaluates it and responds with either a yes/no answer or a counter proposal with some features modified. This process can go back and forth until an agreement is reached or the agents decide to stop. If an agreement is reached and one agent cannot fulfill the commitment, it needs to pay the other party a decommitment penalty as specified in the commitment. A negotiation starts with a proposal, which announces that a task (t) needs to be performed includes the following attributes: 1. earliest start time (est): the earliest start time of task t; task t cannot be started before time est. 2. deadline (dl): the latest finish time of the task; the task needs to be finished before the deadline dl. 3. minimum quality requirement (minq): the task needs to be finished with a quality achievement no less than minq. 4. regular reward (r): if the task is finished as the contract requested, the contractor agent will get reward r. 5. early finish reward rate (e): if the contractor agent can finish the task earlier than dl, it will get the extra early finish reward proportional to this rate. 6. decommitment penalty rate (p): if the contractor agent cannot perform the task as it promised in the contract or if the contractee agent needs to cancel the contract after it has been confirmed, it also needs to pay a decommitment penalty (p∗r) to the other agent. The above attributes are also called attribute-in-negotiation which are the features of the subject (issue) to be negotiated, and they are domain-dependent. Another type of attribute 1 is the attribute-ofnegotiation, which describes the negotiation process itself and is domain-independent, such as: 1 These attributes are similar to those used in project management; however, the multi-linked negotiation problem cannot be reduced to a project management problem or a scheduling problem. The multi-linked negotiation problem has two dimensions: the negotiations, and the subjects of negotiations. The negotiations are interrelated and the subjects are interrelated; the attributes of negotiations and the attributes of the subjects are interrelated as well. This two-dimensional complexity of interrelationships distinguishes it from the classic project management problem or scheduling problem, where all tasks to be scheduled are local tasks and no negotiation is needed. 1. negotiation duration (δ(v)): the maximum time allowed for negotiation v to complete, either reaching an agreed upon proposal (success) or no agreement (failure). 2. negotiation start time (α(v)): the start time of negotiation v. α(v) is an attribute that needs to be decided by the agent. 3. negotiation deadline ( (v)): negotiation v needs to be finished before this deadline (v). The negotiation is no longer valid after time (v), which is the same as a failure outcome of this negotiation. 4. success probability (ps(v)): the probability that v is successful. It depends on a set of attributes, including both attributes-in-negotiation (i.e. reward, flexibility, etc.) and attributes-of-negotiation (i.e. negotiation start time, negotiation deadline, etc.). An agent involved in multiple related negotiation processes needs to reason on how to manage these negotiations in terms of ordering them and choosing the appropriate values for features. This is the multi-linked negotiation problem [10] : DEFINITION 2.1. A multi-linked negotiation problem is defined as an undirected graph (more specifically, a forest as a set of rooted trees): M = (V, E), where V = {v} is a finite set of negotiations, and E = {(u, v)} is a set of binary relations on V . (u, v) ∈ E denotes that negotiation u and negotiation v are directly-linked. The relationships among the negotiations are described by a forest, a set of rooted trees {Ti}. There is a relation operator associated with every non-leaf negotiation v (denoted as ρ(v)), which describes the relationship between negotiation v and its children. This relation operator has two possible values: AND and OR. The AND relationship associated with a negotiation v means the successful accomplishment of the commitment on v requires all its children nodes have successful accomplishments. The OR relationship associated with a negotiation v means the successful accomplishment of the commitment on v requires at least one child node have successful accomplishment, where the multiple children nodes represent alternatives to accomplish the same goal. Multi-linked negotiation problem is a local optimization problem. To solve a multi-linked negotiation problem is to find a negotiation solution (φ, ϕ) with optimized expected utility EU(φ, ϕ), which is defined as: EU(φ, ϕ) = 2n X i=1 P(χi, ϕ) ∗ (R(χi, ϕ) − C(χi, φ, ϕ)) (1) A negotiation ordering φ defines a partial order of all negotiation issues. A feature assignment ϕ is a mapping function that assigns a value to each attribute that needs to be decided in the negotiation. A negotiation outcome χ for a set of negotiations {vj}, (j = 1, ..., n) specifies the result for each negotiation, either success or failure. There are a total of 2n different outcomes for n negotiations: {chii}, (i = 1, ..., 2n ). P(χi, ϕ) denotes the probability of the outcome χi given the feature assignment ϕ, which is calculated based on the success probability of each negotiation. R(χi, ϕ) denotes the agents utility increase given the outcome χi and the feature assignment ϕ, and C(χi, φ, ϕ) is the sum of the decommitment penalties of those negotiations, which are successful, but need to be abandoned because the failure of other directly related negotiations; these directly related negotiations are performed concurrently with this negotiation or after this negotiation according to the negotiation ordering φ.

This algorithm is used as the core of the decision-making for each individual agent in the negotiation chain scenario. In the rest of the paper, we present our work on how to improve the local solution of a single agent in the global negotiation chain context. 3. NEGOTIATION CHAIN PROBLEM Negotiation chain problem occurs in a multi-agent system, where each agent represents an individual, a company, or an organization, and there is no absolute authority in the system. Each agent has its own utility function for defining the implications of achieving its goals. The agent is designed to optimize its expected utility given its limited information, computational and communication resources. Dynamic tasks arrive to individual agents, most tasks requiring the coordination of multiple agents. Each agent has the scheduling and planning ability to manage its local activities, some of these activities are related to other agents activities. Negotiation is used to coordinate the scheduling of these mutual related activities. The negotiation is tightly connected with the agents local scheduling/planning processes and is also related to other negotiations. An agent may be involved in multiple related negotiations with multiple other agents, and each of the other agents may be involved in related negotiations with others too. Figure 1 describes a complex negotiation chain scenario. The Store, the PC manufacturer, the Memory Producer and the Distribution Center are all involved in multi-linked negotiation problems. Figure 2 shows a distributed model of part of the negotiation chain described in Figure 1. Each agent has a local optimization problem - the multi-linked negotiation problem (represented as an and-or tree), which can be solved using the model and procedures described in Section 2. However, the local optimal solution may not be optimal in the global context given the local model is neither complete or accurate. The dash line in Figure 2 represents the connection of these local optimization problem though the common negotiation subject. Negotiation chain problem O is a group of tightly-coupled local optimization problems: O = {O1, O2, ....On}, Oi denotes the local optimization problem (multi-linked negotiation problem) of agent Ai Agent Ais local optimal solution Slo i maximizes the expected local utility based on an incomplete information and assumptions about other agents local strategies - we defined such incomplete information and imperfect assumptions of agent i as Ii): Uexp i (Slo i , Ii) ≥ Uexp i (Sx i , Ii) for all x = lo. However, the combination of these local optimal solutions {Slo i } : < Slo 1 , Slo 2 , ....Slo n > can be sub-optimal to a set of better local optimal solutions {Sblo i } : < Sblo 1 , Sblo 2 , ....Sblo n > if the global utility can be improved without any agents local utility being decreased by using {Sblo i }. In other words, {Slo i } is dominated by {Sblo i } ({Slo i } ≺ {Sblo i }) iff: Ui(< Slo 1 , Slo 2 , ....Slo n >) ≤ Ui(< Sblo 1 , Sblo 2 , ....Sblo n >) for i = 1, ...n and Pn i=1 Ui(< Slo 1 , Slo 2 , ....Slo n >) < Pn i=1 Ui(< Sblo 1 , Sblo 2 , ....Sblo n >) There are multiple sets of better local optimal solutions: {Sblo1 i }, {Sblo2 i }, ... {Sblom i }. Some of them may be dominated by others. A set of better local optimal solutions {S blog i } that is not dominated by any others is called best local optimal. If a set of best local optimal solutions {S blog i } dominates all others, {S blog i } is called globally local optimal. However, sometimes the globally local optimal set does not exist, instead, there exist multiple sets of best local optimal solutions. Even if the globally local optimal solution does exist in theory, finding it may not be realistic given the agents are making decision concurrently, to construct the perfect local information and assumptions about other agents (Ii) in this dynamic environment is a very difficult and sometimes even impossible task. The goal of this work is to improve each agents local model about other agents (Ii) through meta-level coordination. As Ii become more accurate, the agents local optimal solution to its local multi-linked negotiation problem become a better local optimal solution in the context of the global negotiation chain problem. We are not arguing that this statement is a universal valid statement that holds in all situations, but our experimental work shows that the sum of the agents utilities in the system has been improved by 95% on average when meta-level coordination is used to improve each agents local model Ii. In this work, we focus on improving the agents local model through two directions. One direction is to build a better function to describe the relationship between the success probability of the negotiation and the flexibility allocated to the negotiation. The other direction is to find how to allocate time more efficiently for each negotiation in the negotiation chain context. 4. NEW MECHANISM - META-LEVEL COORDINATION In order for an agent to get a better local model about other agents in the negotiation chain context, we introduce a pre-negotiation phase into the local negotiation process. During the pre-negotiation phase, agents communicate with other agents who have tasks contracting relationships with them, they transfer meta-level information before they decide on how and when to do the negotiations. Each agent tells other agents what types of tasks it will ask them to perform, and the probability distributions of some parameters of those tasks, i.e. the earliest start times and the deadlines, etc. When these probability distributions are not available directly, agents can learn such information from their past experience. In our experiment described later, such distributed information is learned rather than being directly told by other agents. Specifically, each agent provides the following information to other related agents: • Whether additional negotiation is needed in order to make a decision on the contracting task; if so, how many more negotiations are needed. negCount represents the total number of additional negotiations needed for a task, including additional negotiations needed for its subtasks that happen among other agents. In a negotiation chain situation, this information is being propagated and updated through the chain until 52 The Sixth Intl.

Let subNeg(T) be a set of subtasks of task T that require additional negotiations, then we have: negCount(T) = |subNeg(T)| + X t∈subNeg(T ) (negCount(t)) (2) For example, in the scenario described in Figure 1, for the distribution center, task Order Hardware consists of three subtasks that need additional negotiations with other agents: Order Chips, Order Memory and Deliver Hardware. However, no further negotiations are needed for other agents to make decision on these subtasks, hence the negCount for these subtasks are 0. The following information is sent to the PC manufacturer by the distribution center: negCount(Order Hardware) = 3 For the PC manufacturer task Order Computer contains two subtasks that requires additional negotiations: Deliver Computer and Order Hardware. When the PC manufacturer receives the message from the Distribution Center, it updates its local information: negCount(Order Computer) = 2+ negCount(Deliver Computer)(0)+ negCount(Order Hardware)(3) = 5 and sends the updated information to the Store Agent. • Whether there are other tasks competing with this task and what is the likelihood of conflict. Conflict means that given all constrains, the agent cannot accomplish all tasks on time, it needs to reject some tasks. The likelihood of conflict Pcij between a task of type i and another task of type j is calculated based on the statistical model of each tasks parameters, including earliest start time (est), deadline (dl), task duration (dur) and slack time (sl), using a formula [7]: Pcij = P(dli − estj ≤ duri + durj ∧ dlj − esti ≤ duri + durj) When there are more than two types of tasks, the likelihood of no conflict between task i and the rest of the tasks, is calculated as: PnoConflict(i) = Qn j=1,j=i(1 − Pcij) For example, the Memory Producer tells the Distribution Center about the task Order Memory. Its local decision does not involve additional negotiation with other agents (negCount = 0), however, there is another task from the Store Agent that competes with this task, thus the likelihood of no conflict is 0.5 (PnoConflict = 0.5). On the other hand, the CPU Producer tells the Distribution Center about the task Order Chips: its local decision does not involve additional negotiation with other agents, and there are no other tasks competing with this task (PnoConflict = 1.0) given the current environment setting. Based on the above information, the Distribution Center knows that task Order Memory needs more flexibility than task Order Chips in order to be successful in negotiation. Meanwhile, the Distribution Center would tell the PC Manufacturer that task Order Hardware involves further negotiation with other agents (negCount = 3), and that its local decision depends on other agents decisions. This piece of information helps the PC Manufacturer allocate appropriate flexibility for task Order Hardware in negotiation.

During system performance, agents are continually monitoring these characteristics. An updated message will be send to related agents when there is significant change of the meta-level information. Next we will describe how the agent uses the meta-level information transferred during the pre-negotiation phase. This information will be used to improve the agents local model, more specifically, they are used in the agents local decision-making process by affecting the values of some features. Especially, we will be concerned with two features that have strong implications for the agents macro strategy for the multi-linked negotiations, and hence also affect the performance of a negotiation chain significantly. The first is the amount of flexibility specified in the negotiation parameter. The second feature we will explore is the time allocated for the negotiation process to complete. The time allocated for each negotiation affects the possible ordering of those negotiations, and it also affects the negotiation outcome. Details are discussed in the following sections. 4.1 Flexibility and Success Probability Agents not only need to deal with complex negotiation problems, they also need to handle their own local scheduling and planning process that are interleaved with the negotiation process. Figure 3 shows the local task structures of the PC Manufacturer and the Distribution Center. Some of these tasks can be performed locally by the PC manufacturer, such as Get Software and Install Software, while other tasks (non-local tasks) such as Order Hardware and Deliver Computer need to be performed by other agents.The PC Manufacturer needs to negotiate with the Distribution Center and the Transporter about whether they can perform these tasks, and if so, when and how they will perform them. When the PC Manufacturer negotiates with other agents about the non-local task, it needs to have the other agents arrangement fit into its local schedule. Since the PC Manufacturer is dealing with multiple non-local tasks simultaneously, it also needs to ensure the commitments on these non-local tasks are consistent with each other. For example, the deadline of task Order Hardware cannot be later than the start time of task Deliver Computer. Figure 4 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 53 Order_Hardware Deliver_Computer [34, 40] process time: 4 process time: 3 [11, 28] [11, 28] process time: 11 Get_Software Install_Software [28, 34] process time: 2 Order_Computer starts at time 11 and finishes by 40 Figure 4: A Sample Local Schedule of the PC Manufacturer shows a sample local schedule of the PC Manufacturer. According to this schedule, as long as task Order Hardware is performed during time [11, 28] and task Deliver Computer is performed during time [34, 40], there exists a feasible schedule for all tasks and task Order Computer can be finished by time 40, which is the deadline promised to the Customer. These time ranges allocated for task Order Hardware and task Deliver Computer are called consistent ranges; the negotiations on these tasks can be performed independently within these ranges without worrying about conflict. Notice that each task should be allocated with a time range that is large enough to accommodate the estimated task process time. The larger the range is, the more likely the negotiation will succeed, because it is easier for the other agent to find a local schedule for this task. Then the question is, how big should this time range be? We defined a quantitative measure called flexibility: Given a task t, suppose the allocated time range for t is [est, dl], est is the earliest start time and dl stands for the deadline, flexibility(t) = dl − est − process time(t) process time(t) (3) Flexibility is an important attribute because it directly affects the possible outcome of the negotiation. The success probability of a negotiation can be described as a function of the flexibility. In this work, we adopt the following formula for the success probability function based on the flexibility of the negotiation issue: ps(v) = pbs(v) ∗ (2/π) ∗ (arctan(f(v) + c))) (4) This function describes a phenomenon where initially the likelihood of a successful negotiation increases significantly as the flexibility grows, and then levels off afterward, which mirrors our experience from previous experiments. pbs is the basic success probability of this negotiation v when the flexibility f(v) is very large. c is a parameter used to adjust the relationship. Different function patterns can result from different parameter values, as shown in Figure 5. This function describes the agents assumption about how the other agent involved in this negotiation would response to this particular negotiation request, when it has flexibility f(v). This function is part of the agents local model about other agents. To improve the accuracy of this function and make it closer to the reality, the agent adjusts these two values according to the meta-level information transferred during pre-negotiation phase. The values of c depends on whether there is further negotiation involved and whether there are other tasks competing with this task for common resources. If so, more flexibility is needed for this issue and hence c should be assigned a smaller value. In our implementation, the following procedure is used to calculate c based on the meta-level information negCount and PnoConflict: if(PnoConflict > 0.99) // no other competing task c = Clarge − negCount else // competing task exists c = Csmall This procedure works as follows: when there is no other competing Figure 5: Different Success Probability Functions task, c depends on the number of additional negotiations needed. The more additional negotiations that are needed, the smaller value c has, hence more flexibility will be assigned to this issue to ensure the negotiation success. If no more negotiation is needed, c is assigned to a large number Clarge, meaning that less flexibility is needed for this issue. When there are other competing tasks, c is assigned to a small number Csmall, meaning that more flexibility is needed for this issue. In our experimental work, we have Clarge as 5 and Csmall as 1. These values are selected according to our experience; however, a more practical approach is to have agents learn and dynamically adjust these values. This is also part of our future work. pbs is calculated based on PnoConflict, f(v) (the flexibility of v in previous negotiation), and c, using the reverse format of equation 4. pbs(v) = min(1.0, PnoConflict(v)∗(π/2)/(arctan(f(v)+c))) (5) For example, based on the scenario described above, the agents have the following values for c and pbs based on the meta-level information transferred: • PC Manufacturer, Order Hardware: pbs = 1.0, c = 2; • Distribution Center, Order Chips: pbs = 1.0, c = 5; • Store Agent, Order Memory: pbs = 0.79, c = 1; Figure 5 shows the different patterns of the success probability function given different parameter values. Based on such patterns, the Store Agent would allocate more flexibility to the task Order Memory to increase the likelihood of success in negotiation. In the agents further negotiation process, formula 4 with different parameter values is used in reasoning on how much flexibility should be allocated to a certain issue. The pre-negotiation communication occurs before negotiation, but not before every negotiation session. Agents only need to communicate when the environment changes, for example, new types of tasks are generated, the characteristics of tasks changes, the negotiation partner changes, etc. If no major change happens, the agent can just use the current knowledge from previous communications. The communication and computation overhead of this prenegotiation mechanism is very small, given the simple information collection procedure and the short message to be transferred. We will discuss the effect of this mechanism in Section 5. 4.2 Negotiation Duration and Deadline In the agents local model, there are two attributes that describe how soon the agent expects the other agent would reply to the negotiation v: negotiation duration δ(v) and negotiation deadline (v) 54 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Table 1: Examples of negotiations (δ(v): negotiation duration, s.p.: success probability) index task-name δ(v) reward s.p. penalty 1 Order Hardware 4 6 0.99 3 2 Order Chips 4 1 0.99 0.5 3 Order Memory 4 1 0.80 0.5 4 Deliver Hardware 4 1 0.70 0.5 . These two important attributes that affect the negotiation solution. Part of the negotiation solution is a negotiation ordering φ which specifies in what order the multiple negotiations should be performed. In order to control the negotiation process, every negotiation should be finished before its negotiation deadline, and the negotiation duration is the time allocated for this negotiation. If a negotiation cannot be finished during the allocated time, the agent has to stop this negotiation and consider it as a failure. The decision about the negotiation order depends on the success probability, reward, and decommitment penalty of each negotiation. A good negotiation order should reduce the risk of decommitment and hence reduce the decommitment penalty. A search algorithm has been developed to find such negotiation order described in [10]. For example, Table 1 shows some of the negotiations for the Distribution Center and their related attributes. Given enough time (negotiation deadline is greater than 16), the best negotiation order is: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1. The most uncertain negotiation (4: Deliver Hardware) is performed first. The negotiation with highest penalty (1: Order hardware) is performed after all related negotiations (2, 3, and 4) have been completed so as to reduce the risk of decommitment. If the negotiation deadline is less than 12 and greater than 8, the following negotiation order is preferred: (4, 3, 2) → 1, which means negotiation 4, 3, 2 can be performed in parallel, and 1 needs to be performed after them. If the negotiation deadline is less than 8, then all negotiations have to be performed in parallel, because there is no time for sequencing negotiations. In the original model for single agent [10], the negotiation deadline (v) is assumed to be given by the agent who initiates the contract. The negotiation duration δ(v) is an estimation of how long the negotiation takes based on experience. However, the situation is not that simple in a negotiation chain problem. Considering the following scenario. When the customer posts a contract for task Purchase Computer, it could require the Store Agent to reply by time 20. Time 20 can be considered as the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer. When the Store Agent negotiates with the PC Manufacturer about Order Computer, what negotiation deadline should it specify? How long the negotiation on Order Computer takes depends on how the PC Manufacturer handles its local multiple negotiations: whether it replies to the Store Agent first or waits until all other related negotiations have been settled. However, the ordering of negotiations depends on the negotiation deadline on Order Computer, which should be provided by the Store Agent. The negotiation deadline of Order Computer for the PC Manufacturer is actually decided based on the negotiation duration of Order Computer for the Store Agent. How much time the Store Agent would like to spend on the negotiation Order Computer is its duration, and also determines the negotiation deadline for the PC Manufacturer. Now the question arises: how should an agent decide how much time it should spend on each negotiation, which actually affects the other agents negotiation decisions. The original model does not handle this question since it assumes the negotiation duration δ(v) is known. Here we propose three different approaches to handle this issue. 1. same-deadline policy. Use the same negotiation deadline for all related negotiations, which means allocate all available time to all negotiations: δ(v) = total available time For example if the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer is 20, the Store Agent will tell the PC Manufacturer to reply by 20 for Order Computer (ignoring the communication delay). This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy. Allocate time for each negotiation according to the meta-level information transferred in the pre-negotiation phase. A more complicated negotiation, which involves further negotiations, should be allocated additional time. For example, the PC Manufacturer allocates a duration of 12 for the negotiation Order Hardware, and a duration of 4 for Deliver Computer. The reason is that the negotiation with the Distribution Center about Order Hardware is more complicated because it involves further negotiations between the Distribution Center and other agents. In our implementation, we use the following procedure to decide the negotiation duration δ(v): if(negCount(v) >= 3) // more additional negotiation needed δ(v) = (negCount(v)−1)∗basic neg cycle else if(negCount(v) > 0) // one or two additional negotiations needed δ(v) = 2 ∗ basic neg cycle else //no additional negotiation δ(v) = basic neg cycle + 1 basic neg cycle represents the minimum time needed for a negotiation cycle (proposal-think-reply), which is 3 in our system setting including communication delay. One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking. Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy. Evenly divide the available time among the n related negotiations: δ(v) = total available time/n For example, if the current time is 0, and the negotiation deadline for Order Computer is 21, given two other related negotiations, Order Hardware and Deliver Computer, each negotiation is allocated with a duration of 7. Intuitively we feel the strategy 1 may not be a good one, because performing all negotiations in parallel would increase the risk of decommitment and hence also decommitment penalties. However, it is not very clear how strategy 2 and 3 perform, and we will discuss some experimental results in Section 5. 5. EXPERIMENTS To verify and evaluate the mechanisms presented for the negotiation chain problem, we implemented the scenario described in Figure 1 . New tasks were randomly generated with decommitment penalty rate p ∈ [0, 1], early finish reward rate e ∈ [0, 0.3], and deadline dl ∈ [10, 60] (this range allows different flexibilities available for those sub-contracted tasks), and arrived at the store agent periodically. We performed two sets of experiments to study The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 55 Table 2: Parameter Values Without/With Meta-level Information fixed-flex meta-info-flex negotiation pbs pbs c Order Computer 0.95 1.0 0 Order Memory (1) 0.95 0.79 1 Order Hardware 0.95 1.0 2 Deliver Computer 0.95 1.0 1 Deliver Hardware 0.95 1.0 5 Order Chips 0.95 1.0 1 Order Memory (2) 0.95 0.76 1 Figure 6: Different Flexibility Policies how the success probability functions and negotiation deadlines affect the negotiation outcome, the agents utilities and the systems overall utility. In this experiment, agents need to make decision on negotiation ordering and feature assignment for multiple attributes including: earliest start time, deadline, promised finish time, and those attributes-of-negotiation. To focus on the study of flexibility, in this experiment, the regular rewards for each type of tasks are fixed and not under negotiation. Here we only describe how agents handle the negotiation duration and negotiation deadlines because they are the attributes affected by the pre-negotiation phase. All other attributes involved in negotiation are handled according to how they affect the feasibility of local schedule (time-related attributes) and how they affect the negotiation success probability (time and cost related attributes) and how they affect the expect utility. A search algorithm [10] and a set of partial order scheduling algorithms are used to handle these attributes. We tried two different flexibility policies. 1. fixed-flexibility policy: the agent uses a fixed value as the success probability (ps(v) = pbs(v)), according to its local knowledge and estimation. 2. meta-info-flexibility policy: the agent uses the function ps(v) = pbs(v) ∗ (2/π) ∗ (arctan(f(v) + c))) to model the success probability. It also adjusts those parameters (pbs(v) and c) according to the meta-level information obtained in prenegotiation phase as described in Section 4. Table 2 shows the values of those parameters for some negotiations. Figure 6 shows the results of this experiment. This set of experiments includes 10 system runs, and each run is for 1000 simulating time units. In the first 200 time units, agents are learning about the task characteristics, which will be used to calculate the conflict probabilities Pcij. At time 200, agents perform meta-level information communication, and in the next 800 time units, agents use the meta-level information in their local reasoning process. The data was collected over the 800 time units after the pre-negotiation Figure 7: Different Negotiation Deadline Policies phase 2 . One Purchase Computer task is generated every 20 time units, and two Purchase Memory tasks are generated every 20 time units. The deadline for task Purchase Computer is randomly generated in the range of [30, 60], the deadline for task Purchase Memory is in the range of [10, 30]. The decommitment penalty rate is randomly generated in the range of [0, 1]. This setting creates multiple concurrent negotiation chain situations; there is one long chain: Customer - Store - PC Manufacturer - Distribution Center - Producers - Transporter and two short chains: Customer - Store - Memory Producer This demonstrates that this mechanism is capable of handling multiple concurrent negotiation chains. All agents perform better in this example (gain more utility) when they are using the meta-level information to adjust their local control through the parameters in the success probability function (meta-info-flex policy). Especially for those agents in the middle of the negotiation chain, such as the PC Manufacturer and the Distribution Center, the flexibility policy makes a significant difference. When the agent has a better understanding of the global negotiation scenario, it is able to allocate more flexibility for those tasks that involve complicated negotiations and resource contentions. Therefore, the success probability increases and fewer tasks are rejected or canceled (90% of the tasks have been successfully negotiated over when using meta-level information, compared to 39% when no pre-negotiation is used), resulting in both the agent and the system achieving better performance. In the second set of experiments studies, we compare three negotiation deadline policies described in Section 4.2 when using the meta-info flexibility policy described above. The initial result shows that the same-deadline policy and the meta-info-deadline policy perform almost the same when the amount of system workload level is moderate, tasks can be accommodated given sufficient flexibility. In this situation, with either of the policies, most negotiations are successful, and there are few decommitment occurrences, so the ordering of negotiations does not make too much difference. Therefore, in this second set of experiments, we increase the number of new tasks generated to raise the average workload in the system. One Purchase Computer task is generated every 15 time units, three Purchase Memory tasks are generated every 2 We only measure the utility collected after the learning phase because that the learning phase is relatively short comparing to the evaluation phase, also during the learning phase, no meta-level information is used, so some of the policies are invalid. 56 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 15 time units, and one task Deliver Gift (directly from the customer to the Transporter) is generated every 10 time units. This setup generates a higher level of system workload, which results in some tasks not being completed no matter what negotiation ordering is used. In this situation, we found the meta-info-deadline policy performs much better than same-deadline policy (See Figure 7). When an agent uses the same-deadline policy, all negotiations have to be performed in parallel. In the case that one negotiation fails, all related tasks have to be canceled, and the agent needs to pay multiple decommitment penalties. When the agent uses the meta-info-deadline policy, complicated negotiations are allocated more time and, correspondingly, simpler negotiations are allocated less time. This also has the effect of allowing some negotiations to be performed in sequence. The consequence of sequencing negotiation is that, if there is failure, an agent can simply cancel the other related negotiations that have not been started. In this way, the agent does not have to pay decommitment penalty for those canceled negotiations because no commitment has been established yet. The evenly-divided-deadline policy performs much worse than the meta-info-deadline policy. In the evenly-divideddeadline policy, the agent allocates negotiation time evenly among the related negotiations, hence the complicated negotiation does not get enough time to complete. The above experiment results show that the meta-level information transferred among agents during the pre-negotiation phase is critical in building a more accurate model of the negotiation problem. The reasoning process based on this more accurate model produces an efficient negotiation solution, which improves the agents and the systems overall utility significantly. This conclusion holds for those environments where the system is facing moderate heavy load and tasks have relatively tight time deadline (our experiment setup is to produce such environment); the efficient negotiation is especially important in such environments. 6. RELATED WORK Fatima, Wooldridge and Jennings [1] studied the multiple issues in negotiation in terms of the agenda and negotiation procedure. However, this work is limited since it only involves a single agents perspective without any understanding that the agent may be part of a negotiation chain. Mailler and Lesser [4] have presented an approach to a distributed resource allocation problem where the negotiation chain scenario occurs. It models the negotiation problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) and a cooperative mediation mechanism is used to centralize relevant portions of the DCOP. In our work, the negotiation involves more complicated issues such as reward, penalty and utility; also, we adopt a distribution approach where no centralized control is needed. A mediator-based partial centralized approach has been applied to the coordination and scheduling of complex task network [8], which is different from our work since the system is a complete cooperative system and individual utility of single agent is not concerned at all. A combinatorial auction [2, 9] could be another approach to solving the negotiation chain problem. However, in a combinatorial auction, the agent does not reason about the ordering of negotiations. This would lead to a problem similar to those we discussed when the same-deadline policy is used. 7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we have solved negotiation chain problems by extending our multi-linked negotiation model from the perspective of a single agent to multiple agents. Instead of solving the negotiation chain problem in a centralized approach, we adopt a distributed approach where each agent has an extended local model and decisionmaking process. We have introduced a pre-negotiation phase that allows agents to transfer meta-level information on related negotiation issues. Using this information, the agent can build a more accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the relationship of flexibility and success probability. This more accurate model helps the agent in choosing the appropriate negotiation solution. The experimental data shows that these mechanisms improve the agents and the systems overall performance significantly. In future extension of this work, we would like to develop mechanisms to verify how reliable the agents are. We also recognize that the current approach of applying the meta-level information is mainly heuristic, so we would like to develop a learning mechanism that enables the agent to learn how to use such information to adjust its local model from previous experience. To further verify this distributed approach, we would like to develop a centralized approach, so we can evaluate how good the solution from this distributed approach is compared to the optimal solution found by the centralized approach. 8.

Introducción La negociación sofisticada para la asignación de tareas y recursos es crucial para la próxima generación de aplicaciones de sistemas de agentes múltiples (MAS). Los grupos de agentes deben negociar eficientemente sobre múltiples cuestiones relacionadas simultáneamente en un entorno complejo y distribuido donde hay plazos por los cuales se deben completar las negociaciones. Esta es un área de investigación importante donde se ha realizado muy poco trabajo. Este trabajo está dirigido a sistemas semi-cooperativos múltiples de agentes, donde cada agente tiene sus propios objetivos y trabaja para maximizar su utilidad local;Sin embargo, el rendimiento de cada agente individual está estrechamente relacionado con la cooperación de otros agentes y el rendimiento general de los sistemas. No existe un objetivo global único en tales sistemas, ya sea porque cada agente representa una organización/usuario diferente, o porque es difícil/imposible diseñar un objetivo global único. Este problema surge debido a múltiples tareas concurrentes, restricciones de recursos e incertidumbres, y por lo tanto ningún agente tiene suficiente conocimiento o recursos computacionales para determinar qué es mejor para todo el sistema [11]. Un ejemplo de dicho sistema sería una organización virtual [12] (es decir, una cadena de suministro) formada dinámicamente en un mercado electrónico como el desarrollado por el Proyecto Conoise [5]. Para lograr tareas que lleguen continuamente a la organización virtual, se necesitan y prefieren la reubicación de la sub-tarta. No existe un objetivo global único ya que cada agente puede estar involucrado en múltiples organizaciones virtuales. Mientras tanto, el desempeño de cada agente individual está estrechamente relacionado con la cooperación de otros agentes y el desempeño general de las organizaciones virtuales. La negociación en tales sistemas no es un juego de suma cero, un acuerdo que aumenta los servicios públicos de ambos agentes se puede encontrar a través de una negociación eficiente. Además, hay múltiples encuentros entre los agentes ya que las nuevas tareas llegan todo el tiempo. En tales negociaciones, el precio puede o no ser importante, ya que se puede solucionar como resultado de un contrato a largo plazo. Otros factores como la calidad y el tiempo de entrega también son importantes. Los mecanismos de reputación en el sistema hacen que las trampas no sean atractivas desde un punto de vista a largo plazo debido a múltiples encuentros entre los agentes. En tales sistemas, los agentes se interesan porque se centran principalmente en sus propios objetivos;Pero también son semi-cooperativos, lo que significa que están dispuestos a ser sinceros y colaborar con otros agentes para encontrar soluciones que sean beneficiosas para todos los participantes, incluido sí mismo;Aunque no ascará voluntariamente su propia utilidad a cambio de otros beneficios. Otra gran diferencia entre este trabajo y otro trabajo sobre la negociación es que la negociación, aquí, no se considera un proceso independiente. Más bien, es una parte de la actividad de los agentes que está estrechamente entrelazada con la planificación, programación y ejecución de las actividades de los agentes, que también pueden relacionarse con otras negociaciones. Según este reconocimiento, este trabajo sobre negociación se refiere más al proceso de toma de decisiones de nivel meta en la negociación en lugar de los protocolos o idiomas básicos. El objetivo de esta investigación es desarrollar un conjunto de macroestrategias que permitan a los agentes administrar de manera efectiva múltiples negociaciones relacionadas, incluidas, entre otros, los siguientes temas: cuánto tiempo se debe dedicar a cada negociación, cuánta flexibilidad (verLa definición formal en la fórmula 3) debe asignarse para cada negociación, y en qué orden se deben realizar 50 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas las negociaciones. Estas estrategias macro son diferentes de esas microestrategias que dirigen el hilo de negociación individual, como si el agente debe admitir y cuánto debe admitir el agente, etc. [3]. En este documento extendemos un modelo de negociación múltiple [10] desde una perspectiva de un solo agente a una perspectiva de múltiples agentes, de modo que un grupo de agentes involucrados en cadenas de negociaciones interrelacionadas puede encontrar estrategias de negociación macro casi óptimas para perseguir susnegociaciones. El resto de este documento está estructurado de la siguiente manera. La Sección 2 describe el proceso básico de negociación y revisa brevemente un modelo de negociación de múltiples agentes de agentes. La Sección 3 presenta un escenario complejo de cadena de suministro. La Sección 4 detalla cómo resolver los problemas que surgen en la cadena de negociación. Sección 5 Informes sobre el trabajo experimental. La Sección 6 discute el trabajo relacionado y la Sección 7 presenta conclusiones y áreas de trabajo futuro.2. Antecedentes sobre la negociación múltiple en este trabajo, el proceso de negociación entre cualquier par de agentes se basa en una versión extendida de la red del contrato [6]: el agente iniciador anuncia la propuesta que incluye múltiples características;El agente que responde lo evalúa y responde con una respuesta sí/no o una contrapropuesta con algunas características modificadas. Este proceso puede ir y venir hasta llegar a un acuerdo o los agentes deciden detenerse. Si se llega a un acuerdo y un agente no puede cumplir con el compromiso, debe pagarle a la otra parte una multa de desmontaje como se especifica en el compromiso. Una negociación comienza con una propuesta, que anuncia que se debe realizar una tarea (t) incluye los siguientes atributos: 1. Hora de inicio más temprana (EST): la hora de inicio más temprana de la tarea t;La tarea T no se puede iniciar antes del tiempo EST. 2. Fecha límite (DL): el último tiempo de finalización de la tarea;La tarea debe terminar antes de la fecha límite DL.3. Requisito de calidad mínimo (MINQ): la tarea debe terminar con un logro de calidad no menos que Minq.4. Recompensa regular (R): si la tarea se termina según lo solicitado el contrato, el agente del contratista obtendrá recompensa r.5. Tasa de recompensa de acabado temprano (e): si el agente del contratista puede terminar la tarea antes que DL, obtendrá el acabado temprano adicional de recompensa proporcional a esta tasa.6. Tasa de multa de desmantelamiento (P): si el agente del contratista no puede realizar la tarea como lo prometió en el contrato o si el agente del contratista debe cancelar el contrato después de que haya sido confirmado, también debe pagar una multa de desmontaje (P ∗r) al otro agente. Los atributos anteriores también se denominan atributo en la negociación que son las características del sujeto (problema) a negociar, y dependen del dominio. Otro tipo de atributo 1 es el atributo de negociación, que describe el proceso de negociación en sí y es independiente del dominio, como: 1 Estos atributos son similares a los utilizados en la gestión de proyectos;Sin embargo, el problema de negociación múltiple no puede reducirse a un problema de gestión de proyectos o un problema de programación. El problema de negociación múltiple tiene dos dimensiones: las negociaciones y los temas de negociaciones. Las negociaciones están interrelacionadas y los sujetos están interrelacionados;Los atributos de las negociaciones y los atributos de los sujetos también están interrelacionados. Esta complejidad bidimensional de las interrelaciones lo distingue del problema clásico de gestión de proyectos o el problema de programación, donde todas las tareas a programar son tareas locales y no se necesitan negociación.1. Duración de la negociación (δ (v)): el tiempo máximo permitió la negociación V para completar, ya sea alcanzando una propuesta acordada (éxito) o ningún acuerdo (falla).2. Tiempo de inicio de negociación (α (v)): la hora de inicio de la negociación v. Α (v) es un atributo que el agente debe decidir.3. Fecha límite de negociación ((v)): la negociación V debe terminar antes de esta fecha límite (v). La negociación ya no es válida después del tiempo (V), que es lo mismo que un resultado de falla de esta negociación.4. Probabilidad de éxito (PS (V)): la probabilidad de que V sea exitosa. Depende de un conjunto de atributos, incluidos ambos atributos en la negociación (es decir, recompensa, flexibilidad, etc.) y atributos de negociación (es decir, hora de inicio de negociación, fecha límite de negociación, etc.). Un agente involucrado en múltiples procesos de negociación relacionados debe razonar sobre cómo administrar estas negociaciones en términos de ordenarlos y elegir los valores apropiados para las características. Este es el problema de negociación múltiple [10]: Definición 2.1. Un problema de negociación múltiple se define como un gráfico no dirigido (más específicamente, un bosque como un conjunto de árboles enraizados): M = (V, E), donde v = {V} es un conjunto finito de negociaciones, y e ={(u, v)} es un conjunto de relaciones binarias en v.(u, v) ∈ E denota que la negociación U y la negociación V están directamente vinculadas. Las relaciones entre las negociaciones son descritas por un bosque, un conjunto de árboles enraizados {ti}. Existe un operador de relación asociado con cada negociación no hojas V (denotada como ρ (v)), que describe la relación entre la negociación V y sus hijos. Este operador de relación tiene dos valores posibles: y y o. La relación y la relación asociada con una negociación V significa que el logro exitoso del compromiso en V requiere que todos sus nodos infantiles tengan logros exitosos. La relación OR asociada con una negociación V significa que el logro exitoso del compromiso en V requiere que al menos un nodo infantil tenga un logro exitoso, donde los nodos de múltiples hijos representan alternativas para lograr el mismo objetivo. El problema de negociación múltiple es un problema de optimización local. Resolver un problema de negociación múltiple es encontrar una solución de negociación (φ, ϕ) con utilidad esperada optimizada EU (φ, ϕ), que se define como: Eu (φ, ϕ) = 2n x i = 1 p (χii, ϕ) ∗ (r (χi, ϕ) - c (χi, φ, ϕ)) (1) Un orden de negociación φ define un orden parcial de todos los problemas de negociación. Una asignación de características ϕ es una función de mapeo que asigna un valor a cada atributo que debe decidirse en la negociación. Un resultado de negociación χ para un conjunto de negociaciones {vj}, (j = 1, ..., n) especifica el resultado para cada negociación, ya sea el éxito o el fracaso. Hay un total de 2n resultados diferentes para n negociaciones: {chii}, (i = 1, ..., 2n). P (χi, ϕ) denota la probabilidad del resultado χi dada la asignación de características ϕ, que se calcula en función de la probabilidad de éxito de cada negociación. R (χi, ϕ) denota el aumento de la utilidad de los agentes dado el resultado χi y la asignación de características ϕ, y C (χi, φ, ϕ) es la suma de las sanciones de desmontaje de esas negociaciones, que son exitosas, pero necesitan ser abandonadasPorque el fracaso de otras negociaciones directamente relacionadas;Estas negociaciones directamente relacionadas se realizan simultáneamente con esta negociación o después de esta negociación de acuerdo con el orden de negociación φ.

Se ha desarrollado un algoritmo de búsqueda heurística [10] para resolver el problema de negociación múltiple de agentes individuales que produce soluciones casi óptimas. Este algoritmo se usa como el núcleo de la toma de decisiones para cada agente individual en el escenario de la cadena de negociación. En el resto del documento, presentamos nuestro trabajo sobre cómo mejorar la solución local de un solo agente en el contexto global de la cadena de negociación.3. Problema de la cadena de negociación El problema de la cadena de negociación ocurre en un sistema de múltiples agentes, donde cada agente representa a un individuo, una empresa o una organización, y no hay autoridad absoluta en el sistema. Cada agente tiene su propia función de utilidad para definir las implicaciones de lograr sus objetivos. El agente está diseñado para optimizar su utilidad esperada dada su información limitada, computación y recursos de comunicación. Las tareas dinámicas llegan a los agentes individuales, la mayoría de las tareas que requieren la coordinación de múltiples agentes. Cada agente tiene la capacidad de programación y planificación para administrar sus actividades locales, algunas de estas actividades están relacionadas con las actividades de otros agentes. La negociación se utiliza para coordinar la programación de estas actividades relacionadas mutuas. La negociación está estrechamente relacionada con los procesos de programación/planificación locales de los agentes y también está relacionada con otras negociaciones. Un agente puede estar involucrado en múltiples negociaciones relacionadas con varios otros agentes, y cada uno de los otros agentes también puede estar involucrado en negociaciones relacionadas con otros. La Figura 1 describe un complejo escenario de la cadena de negociación. La tienda, el fabricante de PC, el productor de memoria y el centro de distribución están involucrados en problemas de negociación múltiples. La Figura 2 muestra un modelo distribuido de parte de la cadena de negociación descrita en la Figura 1. Cada agente tiene un problema de optimización local: el problema de negociación múltiple (representado como un árbol y árbol), que puede resolverse utilizando el modelo y los procedimientos descritos en la Sección 2. Sin embargo, la solución óptima local puede no ser óptima en el contexto global dado que el modelo local no es completo ni precisa. La línea DASH en la Figura 2 representa la conexión de este problema de optimización local a través del sujeto de negociación común. El problema de la cadena de negociación o es un grupo de problemas de optimización local estrechamente acoplados: O = {O1, O2, .... ON}, OI denota el problema de optimización local (problema de negociación múltiple) del agente AI AIS Solución óptima localSLO I maximiza la utilidad local esperada basada en una información y supuestos incompletos sobre las estrategias locales de otros agentes: definimos dicha información incompleta y supuestos imperfectos del Agente I como II): UEXP I (SLO I, II) ≥ UEXP I (SX I,Ii) para todos x = lo. Sin embargo, la combinación de estas soluciones óptimas locales {SLO I}: <SLO 1, SLO 2, .... SLO n> puede ser subóptimo a un conjunto de mejores soluciones óptimas locales {sblo i}: <sblo 1,SBLO 2, .... sblo n> Si la utilidad global se puede mejorar sin que los agentes se disminuyan la utilidad local usando {sblo i}. En otras palabras, {Slo I} está dominado por {sblo i} ({Slo I} ≺ {sblo i}) iff: ui (<slo 1, slo 2, .... slo n>) ≤ ui (<sblo1, sblo 2, .... sblo n>) para i = 1, ... n y pn i = 1 ui (<slo 1, slo 2, ... slo n>) <pn i = 1 ui(<Sblo 1, sblo 2, .... sblo n>) Hay múltiples conjuntos de mejores soluciones óptimas locales: {sblo1 i}, {sblo2 i}, ... {sblom i}. Algunos de ellos pueden estar dominados por otros. Un conjunto de mejores soluciones óptimas locales {S Blog I} que no está dominado por ningún otro se llama Best Local Optimal. Si un conjunto de mejores soluciones óptimas locales {s Blog I} domina a todos los demás, {S Blog I} se llama globalmente local óptimo. Sin embargo, a veces el conjunto óptimo local globalmente no existe, en cambio, existen múltiples conjuntos de las mejores soluciones óptimas locales. Incluso si la solución óptima local globalmente existe en teoría, encontrarla puede no ser realista dado que los agentes están tomando decisión simultáneamente, construir la información y suposiciones locales perfectas sobre otros agentes (ii) en este entorno dinámico es muy difícil y, a veces, es muy difícil y, a veces, es muy difícil y, a vecesincluso tarea imposible. El objetivo de este trabajo es mejorar el modelo local de cada agente sobre otros agentes (ii) a través de la coordinación de meta-nivel. A medida que se vuelven más precisa, los agentes soluciones óptimas locales a su problema local de negociación múltiple se convierten en una mejor solución óptima local en el contexto del problema global de la cadena de negociación. No estamos argumentando que esta declaración es una declaración válida universal que se mantiene en todas las situaciones, pero nuestro trabajo experimental muestra que la suma de los servicios públicos de los agentes en el sistema se ha mejorado en un 95% en promedio cuando la coordinación de nivel meta se usa para mejorarCada agente Modelo local II. En este trabajo, nos centramos en mejorar el modelo local de los agentes a través de dos direcciones. Una dirección es construir una mejor función para describir la relación entre la probabilidad de éxito de la negociación y la flexibilidad asignada a la negociación. La otra dirección es encontrar cómo asignar el tiempo de manera más eficiente para cada negociación en el contexto de la cadena de negociación.4. Nuevo mecanismo: coordinación de nivel meta Para que un agente obtenga un mejor modelo local sobre otros agentes en el contexto de la cadena de negociación, presentamos una fase previa a la negociación en el proceso de negociación local. Durante la fase previa a la negociación, los agentes se comunican con otros agentes que tienen tareas que contratan las relaciones con ellos, transfieren información de meta-nivel antes de decidir cómo y cuándo hacer las negociaciones. Cada agente le dice a otros agentes qué tipos de tareas les pedirán que realicen, y las distribuciones de probabilidad de algunos parámetros de esas tareas, es decir, los primeros tiempos de inicio y los plazos, etc. Cuando estas distribuciones de probabilidad no están disponibles directamente, los agentes pueden aprender dicha información de su experiencia pasada. En nuestro experimento descrito más adelante, dicha información distribuida se aprende en lugar de ser contada directamente por otros agentes. Específicamente, cada agente proporciona la siguiente información a otros agentes relacionados: • Si se necesita negociación adicional para tomar una decisión sobre la tarea de contratación;Si es así, cuántas negociaciones más se necesitan.NegCount representa el número total de negociaciones adicionales necesarias para una tarea, incluidas las negociaciones adicionales necesarias para sus subtareas que ocurren entre otros agentes. En una situación de la cadena de negociación, esta información se está propagando y actualizando a través de la cadena hasta 52 el Sexto INTL. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) E: Hardware de pedido F: Entregue la computadora H: Obtenga la memoria I: Entrega Hardware I: Entrega Hardware F: Entregue la computadora G: Obtenga CPU E: Obtenga hardware y centro de distribución A: CompreComputadora B: Memoria de compra C: Pedir computadora D: Ordene Memory Store Agent PC Fabricante y C: Pedir computadora Figura 2: Modelo distribuido de cadenas de negociación Cada agente tiene información precisa. Deje que Subneg (t) sea un conjunto de subtareas de la Tarea T que requieren negociaciones adicionales, luego tenemos: NegCount (t) = | SubNeg (t) |+ X t∈Subneg (t) (negcount (t)) (2) Por ejemplo, en el escenario descrito en la Figura 1, para el centro de distribución, el hardware de orden de tareas consta de tres subtareas que necesitan negociaciones adicionales con otros agentes: ordenar chips, Ordene la memoria y entrega hardware. Sin embargo, no se necesitan más negociaciones para que otros agentes tomen una decisión sobre estas subtareas, por lo tanto, el Negcount para estas subtareas es 0. La siguiente información es enviada al fabricante de PC por el Centro de distribución: NegCount (Hardware de pedido) = 3 Para la computadora de pedido de tareas del fabricante de PC contiene dos subtareas que requiere negociaciones adicionales: entregar hardware de computadora y pedido. Cuando el fabricante de la PC recibe el mensaje del Centro de distribución, actualiza su información local: NegCount (orden de orden) = 2+ NegCount (entregar computadora) (0)+ negcount (hardware de pedido) (3) = 5 y envía la información actualizadaal agente de la tienda.• Si hay otras tareas compitiendo con esta tarea y cuál es la probabilidad de conflicto. El conflicto significa que, dadas todas las restricciones, el agente no puede lograr todas las tareas a tiempo, debe rechazar algunas tareas. La probabilidad de conflicto PCIJ entre una tarea de tipo I y otra tarea del tipo J se calcula en función del modelo estadístico de cada tarea parámetros, incluida la hora de inicio más temprana (EST), la fecha límite (DL), la duración de la tarea (Dur) y el tiempo de holgura(sl), usando una fórmula [7]: pcij = p (dli - estj ≤ duri + durj ∧ dlj - esti ≤ duri + durj) Cuando hay más de dos tipos de tareas, la probabilidad de no conflicto entre la tarea I yEl resto de las tareas se calcula como: pnoconflict (i) = qn j = 1, j = i (1 - pcij) Por ejemplo, el productor de memoria le dice al centro de distribución sobre la memoria del orden de tareas. Su decisión local no implica negociación adicional con otros agentes (negcount = 0), sin embargo, hay otra tarea del agente de la tienda que compite con esta tarea, por lo que la probabilidad de que no hay conflicto es 0.5 (pnoconflict = 0.5). Por otro lado, el productor de la CPU le dice al centro de distribución sobre los chips de orden de tareas: su decisión local no implica negociación adicional con otros agentes, y no hay otras tareas que compitan con esta tarea (pnoconflict = 1.0) dada la configuración del entorno actual. Según la información anterior, el centro de distribución sabe que la memoria del orden de tareas necesita más flexibilidad que los chips de orden de tareas para tener éxito en la negociación. Mientras tanto, el centro de distribución le diría al fabricante de la PC que el hardware de orden de tareas implica una mayor negociación con otros agentes (negcount = 3), y que su decisión local depende de las decisiones de otros agentes. Esta información ayuda al fabricante de la PC asignar flexibilidad adecuada para el hardware de orden de tareas en la negociación.

Durante el rendimiento del sistema, los agentes monitorean continuamente estas características. Se enviará un mensaje actualizado a agentes relacionados cuando haya un cambio significativo de la información de nivel meta. A continuación, describiremos cómo el agente usa la información de meta-nivel transferida durante la fase de previogociación. Esta información se utilizará para mejorar el modelo local de los agentes, más específicamente, se utilizan en el proceso de toma de decisiones locales de los agentes al afectar los valores de algunas características. Especialmente, nos preocuparemos dos características que tienen fuertes implicaciones para la estrategia de la macro de los agentes para las negociaciones múltiples y, por lo tanto, también afectan significativamente el desempeño de una cadena de negociación. El primero es la cantidad de flexibilidad especificada en el parámetro de negociación. La segunda característica que exploraremos es el tiempo asignado para el proceso de negociación. El tiempo asignado para cada negociación afecta el posible orden de esas negociaciones, y también afecta el resultado de la negociación. Los detalles se discuten en las siguientes secciones.4.1 Flexibilidad y éxito Los agentes de probabilidad no solo necesitan lidiar con problemas de negociación complejos, sino que también necesitan manejar su propio proceso local de programación y planificación que están intercalados con el proceso de negociación. La Figura 3 muestra las estructuras de tareas locales del fabricante de PC y el centro de distribución. El fabricante de la PC puede realizar algunas de estas tareas localmente, como Get Software e Install Software, mientras que otras tareas (tareas no locales), como el hardware de pedido y la computadora, deben ser realizadas por otros agentes. El fabricante de la PC necesitaNegocie con el centro de distribución y el transportador sobre si pueden realizar estas tareas, y de ser así, cuándo y cómo las realizarán. Cuando el fabricante de la PC negocia con otros agentes sobre la tarea no local, necesita que el acuerdo de otros agentes se ajuste a su horario local. Dado que el fabricante de la PC está tratando con múltiples tareas no locales simultáneamente, también necesita garantizar que los compromisos en estas tareas no locales sean consistentes entre sí. Por ejemplo, la fecha límite del hardware del orden de tareas no puede ser posterior a la hora de inicio de la computadora que entrega la computadora. Figura 4 El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 53 Order_hardware EntreT_Computer [34, 40] Tiempo de proceso: 4 Tiempo de proceso: 3 [11, 28] [11, 28] Tiempo de proceso: 11 get_software install_software [28, 34] ProcesoTiempo: 2 Order_Computer comienza en el tiempo 11 y termina por 40 Figura 4: Un programa local de muestra del fabricante de PC muestra un programa local de muestra del fabricante de PC. De acuerdo con este cronograma, siempre que el hardware de la orden de tareas se realice durante el tiempo [11, 28] y la computadora de entrega de tareas se realiza durante el tiempo [34, 40], existe un horario factible para todasTiempo 40, que es la fecha límite prometida al cliente. Estos rangos de tiempo asignados para el hardware de orden de tareas y la computadora de entrega de tareas se denominan rangos consistentes;Las negociaciones sobre estas tareas se pueden realizar de forma independiente dentro de estos rangos sin preocuparse por el conflicto. Observe que cada tarea debe asignarse con un rango de tiempo que sea lo suficientemente grande como para acomodar el tiempo de proceso de tarea estimado. Cuanto más grande sea el rango, más probabilidades de la negociación tendrá éxito, porque es más fácil para el otro agente encontrar un horario local para esta tarea. Entonces la pregunta es, ¿qué tan grande debería ser este rango de tiempo? Definimos una medida cuantitativa llamada flexibilidad: dada una tarea t, supongamos que el rango de tiempo asignado para t es [EST, DL], EST es el tiempo de inicio más temprano y DL significa la fecha límite, la flexibilidad (t) = DL - EST - ProcesoTiempo (t) Tiempo de proceso (t) (3) La flexibilidad es un atributo importante porque afecta directamente el posible resultado de la negociación. La probabilidad de éxito de una negociación puede describirse en función de la flexibilidad. En este trabajo, adoptamos la siguiente fórmula para la función de probabilidad de éxito en función de la flexibilidad del problema de la negociación: PS (V) = PBS (V) ∗ (2/π) ∗ (Arctan (F (V) + C))) (4) Esta función describe un fenómeno donde inicialmente la probabilidad de una negociación exitosa aumenta significativamente a medida que crece la flexibilidad, y luego se nivela después, lo que refleja nuestra experiencia de experimentos anteriores.PBS es la probabilidad de éxito básica de esta negociación v cuando la flexibilidad F (v) es muy grande.C es un parámetro utilizado para ajustar la relación. Los diferentes patrones de función pueden resultar de diferentes valores de parámetros, como se muestra en la Figura 5. Esta función describe la suposición de agentes sobre cómo el otro agente involucrado en esta negociación respondería a esta solicitud de negociación particular, cuando tiene flexibilidad F (v). Esta función es parte del modelo local de agentes sobre otros agentes. Para mejorar la precisión de esta función y acercarla a la realidad, el agente ajusta estos dos valores de acuerdo con la información de nivel meta transferida durante la fase previa a la negociación. Los valores de C dependen de si hay una negociación adicional involucrada y si hay otras tareas que compiten con esta tarea por los recursos comunes. Si es así, se necesita más flexibilidad para este problema y, por lo tanto, a C se le debe asignar un valor menor. En nuestra implementación, el siguiente procedimiento se utiliza para calcular C en función de la información de nivel meta-nivel neglic y pnoconflict: if (pnoconflict> 0.99) // no hay otra tarea competitiva c = clarge-negcount else // existe la tarea competitiva c = csmall estoEl procedimiento funciona de la siguiente manera: cuando no hay otra Figura 5 en competencia: Tarea de funciones de probabilidad de éxito diferentes, C depende del número de negociaciones adicionales necesarias. Cuantas negociaciones más adicionales se necesiten, más valor C tiene, por lo tanto, se asignará más flexibilidad a este tema para garantizar el éxito de la negociación. Si no se necesita más negociación, C se asigna a un gran número Clarge, lo que significa que se necesita menos flexibilidad para este problema. Cuando hay otras tareas en competencia, C se asigna a un pequeño número CSmall, lo que significa que se necesita más flexibilidad para este problema. En nuestro trabajo experimental, tenemos a Clarge como 5 y csmall como 1. Estos valores se seleccionan según nuestra experiencia;Sin embargo, un enfoque más práctico es hacer que los agentes aprendan y ajusten dinámicamente estos valores. Esto también es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro.PBS se calcula en base a Pnoconflict, F (V) (la flexibilidad de V en una negociación previa) y C, utilizando el formato inverso de la ecuación 4. PBS (V) = Min (1.0, Pnoconflict (V) ∗ (π/2)/(arctan (f (v)+c))) (5) Por ejemplo, según el escenario descrito anteriormente, los agentes tienen los siguientes valores para C y PBS basados en la información de nivel meta transferida: • Fabricante de PC,Hardware de pedido: PBS = 1.0, C = 2;• Centro de distribución, chips de orden: PBS = 1.0, c = 5;• Agente de almacenamiento, memoria de pedido: PBS = 0.79, C = 1;La Figura 5 muestra los diferentes patrones de la función de probabilidad de éxito dado diferentes valores de parámetros. Según tales patrones, el agente de la tienda asignaría más flexibilidad a la memoria del orden de tareas para aumentar la probabilidad de éxito en la negociación. En el proceso de negociación adicional de los agentes, la fórmula 4 con diferentes valores de parámetros se utiliza en el razonamiento sobre la cantidad de flexibilidad que se debe asignar a un determinado tema. La comunicación previa a la negociación ocurre antes de la negociación, pero no antes de cada sesión de negociación. Los agentes solo necesitan comunicarse cuando el entorno cambia, por ejemplo, se generan nuevos tipos de tareas, las características de las tareas cambian, el compañero de negociación cambia, etc. Si no ocurre un cambio importante, el agente solo puede usar el conocimiento actual de las comunicaciones anteriores. La sobrecarga de comunicación y cálculo de este mecanismo de prenegotiación es muy pequeño, dado el simple procedimiento de recopilación de información y el mensaje corto a transferir. Discutiremos el efecto de este mecanismo en la Sección 5. 4.2 Duración de negociación y fecha límite en el modelo local de los agentes, hay dos atributos que describen cuán pronto el agente espera que el otro agente responda a la negociación v: duración de la negociación δ (v)y fecha límite de negociación (v) 54 El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Tabla 1: Ejemplos de negociaciones (δ (v): duración de la negociación, s.p.: probabilidad de éxito) Índice de la tarea δ (v) recompensa S.P.Penalización 1 Hardware de orden 4 6 0.99 3 2 CHIPS DE PEDIDO 4 1 0.99 0.5 3 Memoria de pedido 4 1 0.80 0.5 4 Entrega hardware 4 1 0.70 0.5. Estos dos atributos importantes que afectan la solución de negociación. Parte de la solución de negociación es una ordenación de negociación φ que especifica en qué orden deben realizarse las negociaciones múltiples. Para controlar el proceso de negociación, cada negociación debe finalizarse antes de su fecha límite de negociación, y la duración de la negociación es el tiempo asignado para esta negociación. Si no se puede terminar una negociación durante el tiempo asignado, el agente debe detener esta negociación y considerarla como un fracaso. La decisión sobre la orden de negociación depende de la probabilidad de éxito, la recompensa y la multa de desmontaje de cada negociación. Una buena orden de negociación debería reducir el riesgo de desafío y, por lo tanto, reducir la multa de desmotrices. Se ha desarrollado un algoritmo de búsqueda para encontrar dicha orden de negociación descrita en [10]. Por ejemplo, la Tabla 1 muestra algunas de las negociaciones para el centro de distribución y sus atributos relacionados. Dado suficiente tiempo (la fecha límite de negociación es mayor que 16), la mejor orden de negociación es: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1. La negociación más incierta (4: entrega hardware) se realiza primero. La negociación con la mayor penalización (1: hardware de pedido) se realiza después de todas las negociaciones relacionadas (2, 3 y 4) se han completado para reducir el riesgo de desmantelamiento. Si la fecha límite de negociación es inferior a 12 y más de 8, se prefiere la siguiente orden de negociación: (4, 3, 2) → 1, lo que significa que la negociación 4, 3, 2 se puede realizar en paralelo y se debe realizar 1después de ellos. Si la fecha límite de negociación es inferior a 8, entonces todas las negociaciones deben realizarse en paralelo, porque no hay tiempo para secuenciar negociaciones. En el modelo original para un solo agente [10], se supone que la fecha límite de negociación (V) está dada por el agente que inicia el contrato. La duración de la negociación δ (v) es una estimación de cuánto tiempo lleva la negociación en función de la experiencia. Sin embargo, la situación no es tan simple en un problema de cadena de negociación. Considerando el siguiente escenario. Cuando el cliente publica un contrato para la computadora de compra de tareas, podría requerir que el agente de la tienda responda por hora 20. El tiempo 20 puede considerarse como la fecha límite de negociación para la computadora de compra. Cuando el agente de la tienda negocia con el fabricante de PC sobre la computadora de pedido, ¿qué fecha límite de negociación debe especificar? Cuánto tiempo lleva la negociación en el pedido de la computadora depende de cómo el fabricante de la PC maneje sus negociaciones múltiples locales: si responde primero al agente de la tienda o espere hasta que se hayan resuelto todas las demás negociaciones relacionadas. Sin embargo, el orden de las negociaciones depende de la fecha límite de negociación en la computadora de orden, que debe ser proporcionada por el agente de la tienda. La fecha límite de negociación de la computadora de pedido para el fabricante de PC se decide en base a la computadora de negociación de la computadora del pedido para el agente de la tienda. El tiempo que el agente de la tienda le gustaría gastar en la computadora de la orden de negociación es su duración, y también determina la fecha límite de negociación para el fabricante de PC. Ahora surge la pregunta: ¿cómo debería un agente decidir cuánto tiempo debe dedicar a cada negociación, lo que realmente afecta las decisiones de negociación de los otros agentes? El modelo original no maneja esta pregunta, ya que supone que se conoce la duración de la negociación δ (v). Aquí proponemos tres enfoques diferentes para manejar este problema.1. Política de la misma línea. Use la misma fecha límite de negociación para todas las negociaciones relacionadas, lo que significa asignar todo el tiempo disponible a todas las negociaciones: δ (v) = Tiempo total disponible, por ejemplo, si la fecha límite de negociación para la computadora de compra es de 20, el agente de la tienda le dirá al fabricante de la PC que respondapor 20 para la computadora de pedido (ignorando el retraso de comunicación). Esta estrategia permite que cada negociación tenga la mayor duración posible, sin embargo, también elimina la posibilidad de realizar negociaciones en secuencia; todas las negociaciones deben realizarse en paralelo porque el tiempo total disponible es lo mismo que la duración de cada negociación.2. Política de meta-Info-Dudline. Asigne el tiempo para cada negociación de acuerdo con la información de meta-nivel transferida en la fase previa a la negociación. Una negociación más complicada, que implica negociaciones adicionales, debe asignarse tiempo adicional. Por ejemplo, el fabricante de PC asigna una duración de 12 para el hardware de la orden de negociación y una duración de 4 para la computadora de entrega. La razón es que la negociación con el centro de distribución sobre el hardware del orden es más complicada porque implica nuevas negociaciones entre el centro de distribución y otros agentes. En nuestra implementación, utilizamos el siguiente procedimiento para decidir la duración de la negociación δ (v): if (negScount (v)> = 3) // se necesita más negociación adicional δ (v) = (negScount (v) −1) ∗ básicociclo neg if (negcount (v)> 0) // una o dos negociaciones adicionales necesarias δ (v) = 2 ∗ ciclo básico de neg // no negociación adicional δ (v) = ciclo básico de neg + 1 ciclo básico de neg la representaEl tiempo mínimo necesario para un ciclo de negociación (propuesta-pensamiento-respuesta), que es 3 en nuestro entorno del sistema, incluido el retraso de comunicación. Se asigna una unidad de tiempo adicional para la negociación más simple porque permite al agente realizar un proceso de razonamiento más complicado en el pensamiento. Nuevamente, la estructura de este procedimiento se selecciona según la experiencia, y los agentes pueden aprender y ajustarla dinámicamente.3. Política de diádina de punto uniformemente dividido. Divida uniformemente el tiempo disponible entre las N negociaciones relacionadas: δ (v) = Tiempo total disponible/N Por ejemplo, si el tiempo actual es 0, y la fecha límite de negociación para la computadora de pedido es de 21, dadas otras dos negociaciones relacionadas, hardware de pedidos yEntregue la computadora, cada negociación se asigna con una duración de 7. Intuitivamente creemos que la Estrategia 1 puede no ser buena, porque realizar todas las negociaciones en paralelo aumentaría el riesgo de desmantelamiento y, por lo tanto, también de desmontaje. Sin embargo, no está muy claro cómo funcionan la estrategia 2 y 3, y discutiremos algunos resultados experimentales en la Sección 5. 5. Experimentos Para verificar y evaluar los mecanismos presentados para el problema de la cadena de negociación, implementamos el escenario descrito en la Figura 1. Las nuevas tareas se generaron aleatoriamente con la tasa de penalización de desmontaje p ∈ [0, 1], la tasa de recompensa de acabado temprano e ∈ [0, 0.3] y la fecha límite dl ∈ [10, 60] (este rango permite diferentes flexibilidades disponibles para aquellos subcontratadostareas), y llegó al agente de la tienda periódicamente. Realizamos dos conjuntos de experimentos para estudiar el sexto INTL. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 55 Tabla 2: Valores de parámetros sin/con información de nivel meta fijo negociación metainfo-flex PBS PBS C Orden Computadora 0.95 1.0 0 Memoria de pedido (1) 0.95 0.79 1Orden Hardware 0.95 1.0 2 Entrega Computadora 0.95 1.0 1 Entregue hardware 0.95 1.0 5 CHIPS DE PEDIDO 0.95 1.0 1 Memoria de pedido (2) 0.95 0.76 1 Figura 6: Políticas de flexibilidad diferentes cómo las funciones de probabilidad de éxito y los plazos de negociación afectan el resultado de la negociación, los agentes Utilities de los agentesy la utilidad general de los sistemas. En este experimento, los agentes deben tomar una decisión sobre el pedido de negociación y la asignación de características para múltiples atributos que incluyen: hora de inicio más temprana, fecha límite, tiempo de finalización prometido y esos atributos de negociación. Para centrarse en el estudio de la flexibilidad, en este experimento, las recompensas regulares para cada tipo de tareas son fijas y no están bajo negociación. Aquí solo describimos cómo los agentes manejan la duración de la negociación y los plazos de negociación porque son los atributos afectados por la fase previa a la negociación. Todos los demás atributos involucrados en la negociación se manejan de acuerdo con cómo afectan la viabilidad del cronograma local (atributos relacionados con el tiempo) y cómo afectan la probabilidad de éxito de la negociación (atributos relacionados con el tiempo y los costos) y cómo afectan la utilidad de esperar. Un algoritmo de búsqueda [10] y un conjunto de algoritmos de programación de pedidos parciales se utilizan para manejar estos atributos. Probamos dos políticas de flexibilidad diferentes.1. Política de flexibilidad fija: el agente utiliza un valor fijo como la probabilidad de éxito (PS (V) = PBS (v)), de acuerdo con su conocimiento y estimación local.2. Política de metainfo-flexibilidad: el agente usa la función ps (v) = pbs (v) ∗ (2/π) ∗ (arctan (f (v) + c))) para modelar la probabilidad de éxito. También ajusta esos parámetros (PBS (V) y C) de acuerdo con la información de nivel meta obtenida en la fase de prenegotiación como se describe en la Sección 4. La Tabla 2 muestra los valores de esos parámetros para algunas negociaciones. La Figura 6 muestra los resultados de este experimento. Este conjunto de experimentos incluye 10 ejecuciones del sistema, y cada ejecución es para 1000 unidades de tiempo simuladas. En las primeras 200 unidades horarias, los agentes están aprendiendo sobre las características de la tarea, que se utilizarán para calcular las probabilidades de conflicto PCIJ. En el momento 200, los agentes realizan comunicación de información de meta nivel, y en las próximas 800 unidades horarias, los agentes usan la información de meta-nivel en su proceso de razonamiento local. Los datos se recopilaron durante las 800 unidades de tiempo después de la Figura 7 de la pre-negociación: diferentes políticas de fecha límite de negociación Fase 2. Se genera una tarea de computadora de compra cada 20 unidades de tiempo, y se generan dos tareas de memoria de compra cada 20 unidades de tiempo. La fecha límite para la computadora de compra de tareas se genera aleatoriamente en el rango de [30, 60], la fecha límite para la memoria de compra de tareas está en el rango de [10, 30]. La tasa de penalización de desmontaje se genera aleatoriamente en el rango de [0, 1]. Este entorno crea múltiples situaciones de cadena de negociación concurrente;Hay una cadena larga: Cliente - Tienda - Fabricante de PC - Centro de distribución - Productores - Transportador y dos cadenas cortas: Cliente - Tienda - Productor de memoria Esto demuestra que este mecanismo es capaz de manejar múltiples cadenas de negociación concurrentes. Todos los agentes funcionan mejor en este ejemplo (obtengan más utilidad) cuando están utilizando la información de nivel meta para ajustar su control local a través de los parámetros en la función de probabilidad de éxito (política metainfo-flex). Especialmente para aquellos agentes en el medio de la cadena de negociación, como el fabricante de PC y el centro de distribución, la política de flexibilidad marca una diferencia significativa. Cuando el agente tiene una mejor comprensión del escenario de negociación global, es capaz de asignar más flexibilidad para aquellas tareas que implican negociaciones complicadas y contenciones de recursos. Por lo tanto, el aumento de la probabilidad de éxito y las menos tareas se rechazan o cancelan (el 90% de las tareas se han negociado con éxito cuando se usa información de meta-nivel, en comparación con el 39% cuando no se usa la pre-negociación), lo que resulta en el agente y en el agente y en el agente y enEl sistema logra un mejor rendimiento. En el segundo conjunto de estudios de experimentos, comparamos tres políticas de fecha límite de negociación descritas en la Sección 4.2 cuando utilizan la política de flexibilidad metainfo descrita anteriormente. El resultado inicial muestra que la misma política de la misma línea de línea y la política de meta-Info-Dudline funcionan casi la misma cuando la cantidad de nivel de carga de trabajo del sistema es moderada, las tareas pueden acomodarse dada la flexibilidad suficiente. En esta situación, con cualquiera de las políticas, la mayoría de las negociaciones son exitosas, y hay pocos acontecimientos de desafío, por lo que el orden de las negociaciones no hace demasiada diferencia. Por lo tanto, en este segundo conjunto de experimentos, aumentamos el número de nuevas tareas generadas para elevar la carga de trabajo promedio en el sistema. Se genera una tarea de computadora de compra cada 15 unidades de tiempo, se generan tres tareas de memoria de compra cada 2, solo medimos la utilidad recolectada después de la fase de aprendizaje porque la fase de aprendizaje es relativamente corta en comparación con la fase de evaluación, también durante la fase de aprendizaje, no.Se utiliza información de nivel meta, por lo que algunas de las políticas no son válidas.56 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07), 15 unidades horarias, y una tarea entrega un regalo (directamente del cliente al transportador) se genera cada 10 unidades de tiempo. Esta configuración genera un mayor nivel de carga de trabajo del sistema, lo que resulta en algunas tareas que no se completan sin importar qué orden de negociación se utilice. En esta situación, encontramos que la política de meta-Info-Dadline funciona mucho mejor que la misma política de la misma línea (ver Figura 7). Cuando un agente usa la misma política de la línea dura, todas las negociaciones deben realizarse en paralelo. En el caso de que una negociación falle, todas las tareas relacionadas deben cancelarse, y el agente debe pagar múltiples sanciones de desmontaje. Cuando el agente usa la política de meta-Info-Dudline, las negociaciones complicadas se asignan más tiempo y, en consecuencia, las negociaciones más simples se asignan menos tiempo. Esto también tiene el efecto de permitir que algunas negociaciones se realicen en secuencia. La consecuencia de la negociación de secuenciación es que, si hay un fracaso, un agente simplemente puede cancelar las otras negociaciones relacionadas que no se han iniciado. De esta manera, el agente no tiene que pagar la multa de desmantelamiento por esas negociaciones canceladas porque todavía no se ha establecido un compromiso. La política de diadra dividida uniformemente funciona mucho peor que la política de metainfo-diadline. En la política de DividedDeadline, el agente asigna el tiempo de negociación de manera uniforme entre las negociaciones relacionadas, por lo tanto, la negociación complicada no tiene suficiente tiempo para completar. Los resultados del experimento anterior muestran que la información de nivel meta transferida entre los agentes durante la fase previa a la negociación es fundamental para construir un modelo más preciso del problema de negociación. El proceso de razonamiento basado en este modelo más preciso produce una solución de negociación eficiente, que mejora significativamente los agentes y la utilidad general de los sistemas. Esta conclusión es de aquellos entornos en los que el sistema se enfrenta a una carga pesada moderada y las tareas tienen una fecha límite de tiempo relativamente ajustada (la configuración de nuestro experimento es producir dicho entorno);La negociación eficiente es especialmente importante en tales entornos.6. El trabajo relacionado Fátima, Wooldridge y Jennings [1] estudiaron los múltiples problemas en la negociación en términos de la agenda y el procedimiento de negociación. Sin embargo, este trabajo es limitado ya que solo involucra una perspectiva de agentes individuales sin ningún entendimiento de que el agente puede ser parte de una cadena de negociación. Mailler y Lesser [4] han presentado un enfoque para un problema de asignación de recursos distribuido donde ocurre el escenario de la cadena de negociación. Modela el problema de negociación como un problema de optimización de restricciones distribuidas (DCOP) y se utiliza un mecanismo de mediación cooperativa para centralizar las porciones relevantes del DCOP. En nuestro trabajo, la negociación implica problemas más complicados como recompensa, penalización y utilidad;Además, adoptamos un enfoque de distribución donde no se necesita control centralizado. Se ha aplicado un enfoque centralizado parcial basado en mediador a la coordinación y programación de la red de tareas complejas [8], que es diferente de nuestro trabajo ya que el sistema es un sistema cooperativo completo y la utilidad individual del agente único no se refiere en absoluto. Una subasta combinatoria [2, 9] podría ser otro enfoque para resolver el problema de la cadena de negociación. Sin embargo, en una subasta combinatoria, el agente no razona sobre el orden de las negociaciones. Esto conduciría a un problema similar a los que discutimos cuando se usa la misma política de línea de salida.7. Conclusión y trabajo futuro En este documento, hemos resuelto problemas de la cadena de negociación al extender nuestro modelo de negociación múltiple desde la perspectiva de un solo agente a múltiples agentes. En lugar de resolver el problema de la cadena de negociación en un enfoque centralizado, adoptamos un enfoque distribuido donde cada agente tiene un modelo local extendido y un proceso de toma de decisiones. Hemos introducido una fase previa a la negociación que permite a los agentes transferir información de meta-nivel sobre cuestiones de negociación relacionadas. Usando esta información, el agente puede construir un modelo más preciso de la negociación en términos de modelar la relación de flexibilidad y probabilidad de éxito. Este modelo más preciso ayuda al agente a elegir la solución de negociación adecuada. Los datos experimentales muestran que estos mecanismos mejoran significativamente los agentes y el rendimiento general de los sistemas. En la extensión futura de este trabajo, nos gustaría desarrollar mecanismos para verificar cuán confiables son los agentes. También reconocemos que el enfoque actual de aplicar la información de nivel meta es principalmente heurístico, por lo que nos gustaría desarrollar un mecanismo de aprendizaje que permita al agente aprender cómo usar dicha información para ajustar su modelo local de la experiencia previa. Para verificar aún más este enfoque distribuido, nos gustaría desarrollar un enfoque centralizado, para que podamos evaluar cuán buena se compara la solución de este enfoque distribuido con la solución óptima que se encuentra con el enfoque centralizado.8.

        "Groups of agents need to efficiently negotiate over multiple related issues concurrently in a complex, distributed setting where there are deadlines by which the negotiations must be completed.",
        "This is an important research area where there has been very little work done.",
        "This work is aimed at semi-cooperative multi-agent systems, where each agent has its own goals and works to maximize its local utility; however, the performance of each individual agent is tightly related to other agents cooperation and the systems overall performance.",
        "There is no single global goal in such systems, either because each agent represents a different organization/user, or because it is difficult/impossible to design one single global goal.",
        "This issue arises due to multiple concurrent tasks, resource constrains and uncertainties, and thus no agent has sufficient knowledge or computational resources to determine what is best for the whole system [11].",
        "An example of such a system would be a virtual organization [12] (i.e. a supply chain) dynamically formed in an electronic marketplace such as the one developed by the CONOISE project [5].",
        "To accomplish tasks continuously arriving in the virtual organization, cooperation and sub-task relocation are needed and preferred.",
        "There is no single global goal since each agent may be involved in multiple virtual organizations.",
        "Meanwhile, the performance of each individual agent is tightly related to other agents cooperation and the virtual organizations overall performance.",
        "The negotiation in such systems is not a zero-sum game, a deal that increases both agents utilities can be found through efficient negotiation.",
        "Additionally, there are multiple encounters among agents since new tasks are arriving all the time.",
        "In such negotiations, price may or may not be important, since it can be fixed resulting from a long-term contract.",
        "Other factors like quality and delivery time are important too.",
        "Reputation mechanisms in the system makes cheating not attractive from a long term viewpoint due to multiple encounters among agents.",
        "In such systems, agents are self-interested because they primarily focus on their own goals; but they are also semi-cooperative, meaning they are willing to be truthful and collaborate with other agents to find solutions that are beneficial to all participants, including itself; though it wont voluntarily scarify its own utility in exchange of others benefits.",
        "Another major difference between this work and other work on negotiation is that negotiation, here, is not viewed as a stand-alone process.",
        "Rather it is one part of the agents activity which is tightly interleaved with the planning, scheduling and executing of the agents activities, which also may relate to other negotiations.",
        "Based on this recognition, this work on negotiation is concerned more about the meta-level decision-making process in negotiation rather than the basic protocols or languages.",
        "The goal of this research is to develop a set of macro-strategies that allow the agents to effectively manage multiple related negotiations, including, but not limited to the following issues: how much time should be spent on each negotiation, how much flexibility (see formal definition in Formula 3) should be allocated for each negotiation, and in what order should 50 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS the negotiations be performed.",
        "These macro-strategies are different from those micro-strategies that direct the individual negotiation thread, such as whether the agent should concede and how much the agent should concede, etc[3].",
        "In this paper we extend a multi-linked negotiation model [10] from a single-agent perspective to a multi-agent perspective, so that a group of agents involved in chains of interrelated negotiations can find nearly-optimal macro negotiation strategies for pursuing their negotiations.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured in the following manner.",
        "Section 2 describes the basic negotiation process and briefly reviews a single agents model of multi-linked negotiation.",
        "Section 3 introduces a complex supply-chain scenario.",
        "Section 4 details how to solve those problems arising in the negotiation chain.",
        "Section 5 reports on the experimental work.",
        "Section 6 discusses related work and Section 7 presents conclusions and areas of future work. 2.",
        "BACKGROUND ON MULTI-LINKED NEGOTIATION In this work, the negotiation process between any pair of agents is based on an extended version of the contract net [6]: the initiator agent announces the proposal including multiple features; the responding agent evaluates it and responds with either a yes/no answer or a counter proposal with some features modified.",
        "This process can go back and forth until an agreement is reached or the agents decide to stop.",
        "If an agreement is reached and one agent cannot fulfill the commitment, it needs to pay the other party a decommitment penalty as specified in the commitment.",
        "A negotiation starts with a proposal, which announces that a task (t) needs to be performed includes the following attributes: 1. earliest start time (est): the earliest start time of task t; task t cannot be started before time est. 2. deadline (dl): the latest finish time of the task; the task needs to be finished before the deadline dl. 3. minimum quality requirement (minq): the task needs to be finished with a quality achievement no less than minq. 4. regular reward (r): if the task is finished as the contract requested, the contractor agent will get reward r. 5. early finish reward rate (e): if the contractor agent can finish the task earlier than dl, it will get the extra early finish reward proportional to this rate. 6. decommitment penalty rate (p): if the contractor agent cannot perform the task as it promised in the contract or if the contractee agent needs to cancel the contract after it has been confirmed, it also needs to pay a decommitment penalty (p∗r) to the other agent.",
        "The above attributes are also called attribute-in-negotiation which are the features of the subject (issue) to be negotiated, and they are domain-dependent.",
        "Another type of attribute 1 is the attribute-ofnegotiation, which describes the negotiation process itself and is domain-independent, such as: 1 These attributes are similar to those used in project management; however, the multi-linked negotiation problem cannot be reduced to a project management problem or a scheduling problem.",
        "The multi-linked negotiation problem has two dimensions: the negotiations, and the subjects of negotiations.",
        "The negotiations are interrelated and the subjects are interrelated; the attributes of negotiations and the attributes of the subjects are interrelated as well.",
        "This two-dimensional complexity of interrelationships distinguishes it from the classic project management problem or scheduling problem, where all tasks to be scheduled are local tasks and no negotiation is needed. 1. negotiation duration (δ(v)): the maximum time allowed for negotiation v to complete, either reaching an agreed upon proposal (success) or no agreement (failure). 2. negotiation start time (α(v)): the start time of negotiation v. α(v) is an attribute that needs to be decided by the agent. 3. negotiation deadline ( (v)): negotiation v needs to be finished before this deadline (v).",
        "The negotiation is no longer valid after time (v), which is the same as a failure outcome of this negotiation. 4. success probability (ps(v)): the probability that v is successful.",
        "It depends on a set of attributes, including both attributes-in-negotiation (i.e. reward, flexibility, etc.) and attributes-of-negotiation (i.e. negotiation start time, negotiation deadline, etc.).",
        "An agent involved in multiple related negotiation processes needs to reason on how to manage these negotiations in terms of ordering them and choosing the appropriate values for features.",
        "This is the multi-linked negotiation problem [10] : DEFINITION 2.1.",
        "A multi-linked negotiation problem is defined as an undirected graph (more specifically, a forest as a set of rooted trees): M = (V, E), where V = {v} is a finite set of negotiations, and E = {(u, v)} is a set of binary relations on V . (u, v) ∈ E denotes that negotiation u and negotiation v are directly-linked.",
        "The relationships among the negotiations are described by a forest, a set of rooted trees {Ti}.",
        "There is a relation operator associated with every non-leaf negotiation v (denoted as ρ(v)), which describes the relationship between negotiation v and its children.",
        "This relation operator has two possible values: AND and OR.",
        "The AND relationship associated with a negotiation v means the successful accomplishment of the commitment on v requires all its children nodes have successful accomplishments.",
        "The OR relationship associated with a negotiation v means the successful accomplishment of the commitment on v requires at least one child node have successful accomplishment, where the multiple children nodes represent alternatives to accomplish the same goal.",
        "Multi-linked negotiation problem is a local optimization problem.",
        "To solve a multi-linked negotiation problem is to find a negotiation solution (φ, ϕ) with optimized expected utility EU(φ, ϕ), which is defined as: EU(φ, ϕ) = 2n X i=1 P(χi, ϕ) ∗ (R(χi, ϕ) − C(χi, φ, ϕ)) (1) A negotiation ordering φ defines a partial order of all negotiation issues.",
        "A feature assignment ϕ is a mapping function that assigns a value to each attribute that needs to be decided in the negotiation.",
        "A negotiation outcome χ for a set of negotiations {vj}, (j = 1, ..., n) specifies the result for each negotiation, either success or failure.",
        "There are a total of 2n different outcomes for n negotiations: {chii}, (i = 1, ..., 2n ).",
        "P(χi, ϕ) denotes the probability of the outcome χi given the feature assignment ϕ, which is calculated based on the success probability of each negotiation.",
        "R(χi, ϕ) denotes the agents utility increase given the outcome χi and the feature assignment ϕ, and C(χi, φ, ϕ) is the sum of the decommitment penalties of those negotiations, which are successful, but need to be abandoned because the failure of other directly related negotiations; these directly related negotiations are performed concurrently with this negotiation or after this negotiation according to the negotiation ordering φ.",

        "The agent is designed to optimize its expected utility given its limited information, computational and communication resources.",
        "Dynamic tasks arrive to individual agents, most tasks requiring the coordination of multiple agents.",
        "Each agent has the scheduling and planning ability to manage its local activities, some of these activities are related to other agents activities.",
        "Negotiation is used to coordinate the scheduling of these mutual related activities.",
        "The negotiation is tightly connected with the agents local scheduling/planning processes and is also related to other negotiations.",
        "An agent may be involved in multiple related negotiations with multiple other agents, and each of the other agents may be involved in related negotiations with others too.",

        "The Store, the PC manufacturer, the Memory Producer and the Distribution Center are all involved in multi-linked negotiation problems.",
        "Figure 2 shows a distributed model of part of the negotiation chain described in Figure 1.",
        "Each agent has a local optimization problem - the multi-linked negotiation problem (represented as an and-or tree), which can be solved using the model and procedures described in Section 2.",

        "However, the combination of these local optimal solutions {Slo i } : < Slo 1 , Slo 2 , ....Slo n > can be sub-optimal to a set of better local optimal solutions {Sblo i } : < Sblo 1 , Sblo 2 , ....Sblo n > if the global utility can be improved without any agents local utility being decreased by using {Sblo i }.",

        "Some of them may be dominated by others.",

        "If a set of best local optimal solutions {S blog i } dominates all others, {S blog i } is called globally local optimal.",
        "However, sometimes the globally local optimal set does not exist, instead, there exist multiple sets of best local optimal solutions.",
        "Even if the globally local optimal solution does exist in theory, finding it may not be realistic given the agents are making decision concurrently, to construct the perfect local information and assumptions about other agents (Ii) in this dynamic environment is a very difficult and sometimes even impossible task.",
        "The goal of this work is to improve each agents local model about other agents (Ii) through meta-level coordination.",
        "As Ii become more accurate, the agents local optimal solution to its local multi-linked negotiation problem become a better local optimal solution in the context of the global negotiation chain problem.",
        "We are not arguing that this statement is a universal valid statement that holds in all situations, but our experimental work shows that the sum of the agents utilities in the system has been improved by 95% on average when meta-level coordination is used to improve each agents local model Ii.",
        "In this work, we focus on improving the agents local model through two directions.",
        "One direction is to build a better function to describe the relationship between the success probability of the negotiation and the flexibility allocated to the negotiation.",
        "The other direction is to find how to allocate time more efficiently for each negotiation in the negotiation chain context. 4.",
        "NEW MECHANISM - META-LEVEL COORDINATION In order for an agent to get a better local model about other agents in the negotiation chain context, we introduce a pre-negotiation phase into the local negotiation process.",
        "During the pre-negotiation phase, agents communicate with other agents who have tasks contracting relationships with them, they transfer meta-level information before they decide on how and when to do the negotiations.",
        "Each agent tells other agents what types of tasks it will ask them to perform, and the probability distributions of some parameters of those tasks, i.e. the earliest start times and the deadlines, etc.",
        "When these probability distributions are not available directly, agents can learn such information from their past experience.",
        "In our experiment described later, such distributed information is learned rather than being directly told by other agents.",
        "Specifically, each agent provides the following information to other related agents: • Whether additional negotiation is needed in order to make a decision on the contracting task; if so, how many more negotiations are needed. negCount represents the total number of additional negotiations needed for a task, including additional negotiations needed for its subtasks that happen among other agents.",

        "Let subNeg(T) be a set of subtasks of task T that require additional negotiations, then we have: negCount(T) = |subNeg(T)| + X t∈subNeg(T ) (negCount(t)) (2) For example, in the scenario described in Figure 1, for the distribution center, task Order Hardware consists of three subtasks that need additional negotiations with other agents: Order Chips, Order Memory and Deliver Hardware.",
        "However, no further negotiations are needed for other agents to make decision on these subtasks, hence the negCount for these subtasks are 0.",
        "The following information is sent to the PC manufacturer by the distribution center: negCount(Order Hardware) = 3 For the PC manufacturer task Order Computer contains two subtasks that requires additional negotiations: Deliver Computer and Order Hardware.",
        "When the PC manufacturer receives the message from the Distribution Center, it updates its local information: negCount(Order Computer) = 2+ negCount(Deliver Computer)(0)+ negCount(Order Hardware)(3) = 5 and sends the updated information to the Store Agent. • Whether there are other tasks competing with this task and what is the likelihood of conflict.",
        "Conflict means that given all constrains, the agent cannot accomplish all tasks on time, it needs to reject some tasks.",
        "The likelihood of conflict Pcij between a task of type i and another task of type j is calculated based on the statistical model of each tasks parameters, including earliest start time (est), deadline (dl), task duration (dur) and slack time (sl), using a formula [7]: Pcij = P(dli − estj ≤ duri + durj ∧ dlj − esti ≤ duri + durj) When there are more than two types of tasks, the likelihood of no conflict between task i and the rest of the tasks, is calculated as: PnoConflict(i) = Qn j=1,j=i(1 − Pcij) For example, the Memory Producer tells the Distribution Center about the task Order Memory.",
        "Its local decision does not involve additional negotiation with other agents (negCount = 0), however, there is another task from the Store Agent that competes with this task, thus the likelihood of no conflict is 0.5 (PnoConflict = 0.5).",
        "On the other hand, the CPU Producer tells the Distribution Center about the task Order Chips: its local decision does not involve additional negotiation with other agents, and there are no other tasks competing with this task (PnoConflict = 1.0) given the current environment setting.",
        "Based on the above information, the Distribution Center knows that task Order Memory needs more flexibility than task Order Chips in order to be successful in negotiation.",
        "Meanwhile, the Distribution Center would tell the PC Manufacturer that task Order Hardware involves further negotiation with other agents (negCount = 3), and that its local decision depends on other agents decisions.",
        "This piece of information helps the PC Manufacturer allocate appropriate flexibility for task Order Hardware in negotiation.",

        "During system performance, agents are continually monitoring these characteristics.",
        "An updated message will be send to related agents when there is significant change of the meta-level information.",
        "Next we will describe how the agent uses the meta-level information transferred during the pre-negotiation phase.",
        "This information will be used to improve the agents local model, more specifically, they are used in the agents local decision-making process by affecting the values of some features.",
        "Especially, we will be concerned with two features that have strong implications for the agents macro strategy for the multi-linked negotiations, and hence also affect the performance of a negotiation chain significantly.",
        "The first is the amount of flexibility specified in the negotiation parameter.",
        "The second feature we will explore is the time allocated for the negotiation process to complete.",
        "The time allocated for each negotiation affects the possible ordering of those negotiations, and it also affects the negotiation outcome.",
        "Details are discussed in the following sections. 4.1 Flexibility and Success Probability Agents not only need to deal with complex negotiation problems, they also need to handle their own local scheduling and planning process that are interleaved with the negotiation process.",
        "Figure 3 shows the local task structures of the PC Manufacturer and the Distribution Center.",
        "Some of these tasks can be performed locally by the PC manufacturer, such as Get Software and Install Software, while other tasks (non-local tasks) such as Order Hardware and Deliver Computer need to be performed by other agents.The PC Manufacturer needs to negotiate with the Distribution Center and the Transporter about whether they can perform these tasks, and if so, when and how they will perform them.",
        "When the PC Manufacturer negotiates with other agents about the non-local task, it needs to have the other agents arrangement fit into its local schedule.",
        "Since the PC Manufacturer is dealing with multiple non-local tasks simultaneously, it also needs to ensure the commitments on these non-local tasks are consistent with each other.",
        "For example, the deadline of task Order Hardware cannot be later than the start time of task Deliver Computer.",
        "Figure 4 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 53 Order_Hardware Deliver_Computer [34, 40] process time: 4 process time: 3 [11, 28] [11, 28] process time: 11 Get_Software Install_Software [28, 34] process time: 2 Order_Computer starts at time 11 and finishes by 40 Figure 4: A Sample Local Schedule of the PC Manufacturer shows a sample local schedule of the PC Manufacturer.",
        "According to this schedule, as long as task Order Hardware is performed during time [11, 28] and task Deliver Computer is performed during time [34, 40], there exists a feasible schedule for all tasks and task Order Computer can be finished by time 40, which is the deadline promised to the Customer.",
        "These time ranges allocated for task Order Hardware and task Deliver Computer are called consistent ranges; the negotiations on these tasks can be performed independently within these ranges without worrying about conflict.",
        "Notice that each task should be allocated with a time range that is large enough to accommodate the estimated task process time.",
        "The larger the range is, the more likely the negotiation will succeed, because it is easier for the other agent to find a local schedule for this task.",
        "Then the question is, how big should this time range be?",
        "We defined a quantitative measure called flexibility: Given a task t, suppose the allocated time range for t is [est, dl], est is the earliest start time and dl stands for the deadline, flexibility(t) = dl − est − process time(t) process time(t) (3) Flexibility is an important attribute because it directly affects the possible outcome of the negotiation.",
        "The success probability of a negotiation can be described as a function of the flexibility.",
        "In this work, we adopt the following formula for the success probability function based on the flexibility of the negotiation issue: ps(v) = pbs(v) ∗ (2/π) ∗ (arctan(f(v) + c))) (4) This function describes a phenomenon where initially the likelihood of a successful negotiation increases significantly as the flexibility grows, and then levels off afterward, which mirrors our experience from previous experiments. pbs is the basic success probability of this negotiation v when the flexibility f(v) is very large. c is a parameter used to adjust the relationship.",
        "Different function patterns can result from different parameter values, as shown in Figure 5.",
        "This function describes the agents assumption about how the other agent involved in this negotiation would response to this particular negotiation request, when it has flexibility f(v).",
        "This function is part of the agents local model about other agents.",
        "To improve the accuracy of this function and make it closer to the reality, the agent adjusts these two values according to the meta-level information transferred during pre-negotiation phase.",
        "The values of c depends on whether there is further negotiation involved and whether there are other tasks competing with this task for common resources.",
        "If so, more flexibility is needed for this issue and hence c should be assigned a smaller value.",
        "In our implementation, the following procedure is used to calculate c based on the meta-level information negCount and PnoConflict: if(PnoConflict > 0.99) // no other competing task c = Clarge − negCount else // competing task exists c = Csmall This procedure works as follows: when there is no other competing Figure 5: Different Success Probability Functions task, c depends on the number of additional negotiations needed.",
        "The more additional negotiations that are needed, the smaller value c has, hence more flexibility will be assigned to this issue to ensure the negotiation success.",
        "If no more negotiation is needed, c is assigned to a large number Clarge, meaning that less flexibility is needed for this issue.",
        "When there are other competing tasks, c is assigned to a small number Csmall, meaning that more flexibility is needed for this issue.",
        "In our experimental work, we have Clarge as 5 and Csmall as 1.",
        "These values are selected according to our experience; however, a more practical approach is to have agents learn and dynamically adjust these values.",
        "This is also part of our future work. pbs is calculated based on PnoConflict, f(v) (the flexibility of v in previous negotiation), and c, using the reverse format of equation 4. pbs(v) = min(1.0, PnoConflict(v)∗(π/2)/(arctan(f(v)+c))) (5) For example, based on the scenario described above, the agents have the following values for c and pbs based on the meta-level information transferred: • PC Manufacturer, Order Hardware: pbs = 1.0, c = 2; • Distribution Center, Order Chips: pbs = 1.0, c = 5; • Store Agent, Order Memory: pbs = 0.79, c = 1; Figure 5 shows the different patterns of the success probability function given different parameter values.",
        "Based on such patterns, the Store Agent would allocate more flexibility to the task Order Memory to increase the likelihood of success in negotiation.",
        "In the agents further negotiation process, formula 4 with different parameter values is used in reasoning on how much flexibility should be allocated to a certain issue.",
        "The pre-negotiation communication occurs before negotiation, but not before every negotiation session.",
        "Agents only need to communicate when the environment changes, for example, new types of tasks are generated, the characteristics of tasks changes, the negotiation partner changes, etc.",
        "If no major change happens, the agent can just use the current knowledge from previous communications.",
        "The communication and computation overhead of this prenegotiation mechanism is very small, given the simple information collection procedure and the short message to be transferred.",
        "We will discuss the effect of this mechanism in Section 5. 4.2 Negotiation Duration and Deadline In the agents local model, there are two attributes that describe how soon the agent expects the other agent would reply to the negotiation v: negotiation duration δ(v) and negotiation deadline (v) 54 The Sixth Intl.",

        "These two important attributes that affect the negotiation solution.",
        "Part of the negotiation solution is a negotiation ordering φ which specifies in what order the multiple negotiations should be performed.",
        "In order to control the negotiation process, every negotiation should be finished before its negotiation deadline, and the negotiation duration is the time allocated for this negotiation.",
        "If a negotiation cannot be finished during the allocated time, the agent has to stop this negotiation and consider it as a failure.",
        "The decision about the negotiation order depends on the success probability, reward, and decommitment penalty of each negotiation.",
        "A good negotiation order should reduce the risk of decommitment and hence reduce the decommitment penalty.",
        "A search algorithm has been developed to find such negotiation order described in [10].",
        "For example, Table 1 shows some of the negotiations for the Distribution Center and their related attributes.",
        "Given enough time (negotiation deadline is greater than 16), the best negotiation order is: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1.",
        "The most uncertain negotiation (4: Deliver Hardware) is performed first.",
        "The negotiation with highest penalty (1: Order hardware) is performed after all related negotiations (2, 3, and 4) have been completed so as to reduce the risk of decommitment.",
        "If the negotiation deadline is less than 12 and greater than 8, the following negotiation order is preferred: (4, 3, 2) → 1, which means negotiation 4, 3, 2 can be performed in parallel, and 1 needs to be performed after them.",
        "If the negotiation deadline is less than 8, then all negotiations have to be performed in parallel, because there is no time for sequencing negotiations.",
        "In the original model for single agent [10], the negotiation deadline (v) is assumed to be given by the agent who initiates the contract.",
        "The negotiation duration δ(v) is an estimation of how long the negotiation takes based on experience.",
        "However, the situation is not that simple in a negotiation chain problem.",
        "Considering the following scenario.",
        "When the customer posts a contract for task Purchase Computer, it could require the Store Agent to reply by time 20.",
        "Time 20 can be considered as the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer.",
        "When the Store Agent negotiates with the PC Manufacturer about Order Computer, what negotiation deadline should it specify?",
        "How long the negotiation on Order Computer takes depends on how the PC Manufacturer handles its local multiple negotiations: whether it replies to the Store Agent first or waits until all other related negotiations have been settled.",
        "However, the ordering of negotiations depends on the negotiation deadline on Order Computer, which should be provided by the Store Agent.",
        "The negotiation deadline of Order Computer for the PC Manufacturer is actually decided based on the negotiation duration of Order Computer for the Store Agent.",
        "How much time the Store Agent would like to spend on the negotiation Order Computer is its duration, and also determines the negotiation deadline for the PC Manufacturer.",
        "Now the question arises: how should an agent decide how much time it should spend on each negotiation, which actually affects the other agents negotiation decisions.",
        "The original model does not handle this question since it assumes the negotiation duration δ(v) is known.",
        "Here we propose three different approaches to handle this issue. 1. same-deadline policy.",
        "Use the same negotiation deadline for all related negotiations, which means allocate all available time to all negotiations: δ(v) = total available time For example if the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer is 20, the Store Agent will tell the PC Manufacturer to reply by 20 for Order Computer (ignoring the communication delay).",
        "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",
        "Allocate time for each negotiation according to the meta-level information transferred in the pre-negotiation phase.",
        "A more complicated negotiation, which involves further negotiations, should be allocated additional time.",
        "For example, the PC Manufacturer allocates a duration of 12 for the negotiation Order Hardware, and a duration of 4 for Deliver Computer.",
        "The reason is that the negotiation with the Distribution Center about Order Hardware is more complicated because it involves further negotiations between the Distribution Center and other agents.",
        "In our implementation, we use the following procedure to decide the negotiation duration δ(v): if(negCount(v) >= 3) // more additional negotiation needed δ(v) = (negCount(v)−1)∗basic neg cycle else if(negCount(v) > 0) // one or two additional negotiations needed δ(v) = 2 ∗ basic neg cycle else //no additional negotiation δ(v) = basic neg cycle + 1 basic neg cycle represents the minimum time needed for a negotiation cycle (proposal-think-reply), which is 3 in our system setting including communication delay.",
        "One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking.",
        "Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy.",
        "Evenly divide the available time among the n related negotiations: δ(v) = total available time/n For example, if the current time is 0, and the negotiation deadline for Order Computer is 21, given two other related negotiations, Order Hardware and Deliver Computer, each negotiation is allocated with a duration of 7.",
        "Intuitively we feel the strategy 1 may not be a good one, because performing all negotiations in parallel would increase the risk of decommitment and hence also decommitment penalties.",
        "However, it is not very clear how strategy 2 and 3 perform, and we will discuss some experimental results in Section 5. 5.",
        "EXPERIMENTS To verify and evaluate the mechanisms presented for the negotiation chain problem, we implemented the scenario described in Figure 1 .",
        "New tasks were randomly generated with decommitment penalty rate p ∈ [0, 1], early finish reward rate e ∈ [0, 0.3], and deadline dl ∈ [10, 60] (this range allows different flexibilities available for those sub-contracted tasks), and arrived at the store agent periodically.",

        "In this experiment, agents need to make decision on negotiation ordering and feature assignment for multiple attributes including: earliest start time, deadline, promised finish time, and those attributes-of-negotiation.",
        "To focus on the study of flexibility, in this experiment, the regular rewards for each type of tasks are fixed and not under negotiation.",
        "Here we only describe how agents handle the negotiation duration and negotiation deadlines because they are the attributes affected by the pre-negotiation phase.",
        "All other attributes involved in negotiation are handled according to how they affect the feasibility of local schedule (time-related attributes) and how they affect the negotiation success probability (time and cost related attributes) and how they affect the expect utility.",
        "A search algorithm [10] and a set of partial order scheduling algorithms are used to handle these attributes.",
        "We tried two different flexibility policies. 1. fixed-flexibility policy: the agent uses a fixed value as the success probability (ps(v) = pbs(v)), according to its local knowledge and estimation. 2. meta-info-flexibility policy: the agent uses the function ps(v) = pbs(v) ∗ (2/π) ∗ (arctan(f(v) + c))) to model the success probability.",
        "It also adjusts those parameters (pbs(v) and c) according to the meta-level information obtained in prenegotiation phase as described in Section 4.",
        "Table 2 shows the values of those parameters for some negotiations.",
        "Figure 6 shows the results of this experiment.",
        "This set of experiments includes 10 system runs, and each run is for 1000 simulating time units.",
        "In the first 200 time units, agents are learning about the task characteristics, which will be used to calculate the conflict probabilities Pcij.",
        "At time 200, agents perform meta-level information communication, and in the next 800 time units, agents use the meta-level information in their local reasoning process.",
        "The data was collected over the 800 time units after the pre-negotiation Figure 7: Different Negotiation Deadline Policies phase 2 .",
        "One Purchase Computer task is generated every 20 time units, and two Purchase Memory tasks are generated every 20 time units.",
        "The deadline for task Purchase Computer is randomly generated in the range of [30, 60], the deadline for task Purchase Memory is in the range of [10, 30].",
        "The decommitment penalty rate is randomly generated in the range of [0, 1].",
        "This setting creates multiple concurrent negotiation chain situations; there is one long chain: Customer - Store - PC Manufacturer - Distribution Center - Producers - Transporter and two short chains: Customer - Store - Memory Producer This demonstrates that this mechanism is capable of handling multiple concurrent negotiation chains.",
        "All agents perform better in this example (gain more utility) when they are using the meta-level information to adjust their local control through the parameters in the success probability function (meta-info-flex policy).",
        "Especially for those agents in the middle of the negotiation chain, such as the PC Manufacturer and the Distribution Center, the flexibility policy makes a significant difference.",
        "When the agent has a better understanding of the global negotiation scenario, it is able to allocate more flexibility for those tasks that involve complicated negotiations and resource contentions.",
        "Therefore, the success probability increases and fewer tasks are rejected or canceled (90% of the tasks have been successfully negotiated over when using meta-level information, compared to 39% when no pre-negotiation is used), resulting in both the agent and the system achieving better performance.",
        "In the second set of experiments studies, we compare three negotiation deadline policies described in Section 4.2 when using the meta-info flexibility policy described above.",
        "The initial result shows that the same-deadline policy and the meta-info-deadline policy perform almost the same when the amount of system workload level is moderate, tasks can be accommodated given sufficient flexibility.",
        "In this situation, with either of the policies, most negotiations are successful, and there are few decommitment occurrences, so the ordering of negotiations does not make too much difference.",
        "Therefore, in this second set of experiments, we increase the number of new tasks generated to raise the average workload in the system.",
        "One Purchase Computer task is generated every 15 time units, three Purchase Memory tasks are generated every 2 We only measure the utility collected after the learning phase because that the learning phase is relatively short comparing to the evaluation phase, also during the learning phase, no meta-level information is used, so some of the policies are invalid. 56 The Sixth Intl.",

        "This setup generates a higher level of system workload, which results in some tasks not being completed no matter what negotiation ordering is used.",
        "In this situation, we found the meta-info-deadline policy performs much better than same-deadline policy (See Figure 7).",
        "When an agent uses the same-deadline policy, all negotiations have to be performed in parallel.",
        "In the case that one negotiation fails, all related tasks have to be canceled, and the agent needs to pay multiple decommitment penalties.",
        "When the agent uses the meta-info-deadline policy, complicated negotiations are allocated more time and, correspondingly, simpler negotiations are allocated less time.",
        "This also has the effect of allowing some negotiations to be performed in sequence.",
        "The consequence of sequencing negotiation is that, if there is failure, an agent can simply cancel the other related negotiations that have not been started.",
        "In this way, the agent does not have to pay decommitment penalty for those canceled negotiations because no commitment has been established yet.",
        "The evenly-divided-deadline policy performs much worse than the meta-info-deadline policy.",
        "In the evenly-divideddeadline policy, the agent allocates negotiation time evenly among the related negotiations, hence the complicated negotiation does not get enough time to complete.",
        "The above experiment results show that the meta-level information transferred among agents during the pre-negotiation phase is critical in building a more accurate model of the negotiation problem.",
        "The reasoning process based on this more accurate model produces an efficient negotiation solution, which improves the agents and the systems overall utility significantly.",
        "This conclusion holds for those environments where the system is facing moderate heavy load and tasks have relatively tight time deadline (our experiment setup is to produce such environment); the efficient negotiation is especially important in such environments. 6.",
        "RELATED WORK Fatima, Wooldridge and Jennings [1] studied the multiple issues in negotiation in terms of the agenda and negotiation procedure.",
        "However, this work is limited since it only involves a single agents perspective without any understanding that the agent may be part of a negotiation chain.",
        "Mailler and Lesser [4] have presented an approach to a distributed resource allocation problem where the negotiation chain scenario occurs.",
        "It models the negotiation problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) and a cooperative mediation mechanism is used to centralize relevant portions of the DCOP.",
        "In our work, the negotiation involves more complicated issues such as reward, penalty and utility; also, we adopt a distribution approach where no centralized control is needed.",
        "A mediator-based partial centralized approach has been applied to the coordination and scheduling of complex task network [8], which is different from our work since the system is a complete cooperative system and individual utility of single agent is not concerned at all.",
        "A combinatorial auction [2, 9] could be another approach to solving the negotiation chain problem.",
        "However, in a combinatorial auction, the agent does not reason about the ordering of negotiations.",
        "This would lead to a problem similar to those we discussed when the same-deadline policy is used. 7.",
        "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we have solved negotiation chain problems by extending our multi-linked negotiation model from the perspective of a single agent to multiple agents.",
        "Instead of solving the negotiation chain problem in a centralized approach, we adopt a distributed approach where each agent has an extended local model and decisionmaking process.",
        "We have introduced a pre-negotiation phase that allows agents to transfer meta-level information on related negotiation issues.",
        "Using this information, the agent can build a more accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the relationship of flexibility and success probability.",
        "This more accurate model helps the agent in choosing the appropriate negotiation solution.",
        "The experimental data shows that these mechanisms improve the agents and the systems overall performance significantly.",
        "In future extension of this work, we would like to develop mechanisms to verify how reliable the agents are.",
        "We also recognize that the current approach of applying the meta-level information is mainly heuristic, so we would like to develop a learning mechanism that enables the agent to learn how to use such information to adjust its local model from previous experience.",
        "To further verify this distributed approach, we would like to develop a centralized approach, so we can evaluate how good the solution from this distributed approach is compared to the optimal solution found by the centralized approach. 8.",

                "Use the same negotiation deadline for all related negotiations, which means allocate all available time to all negotiations: δ(v) = total available time For example if the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer is 20, the Store Agent will tell the PC Manufacturer to reply by 20 for Order Computer (ignoring the communication delay).",
                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",
                "Allocate time for each negotiation according to the meta-level information transferred in the pre-negotiation phase.",
                "A more complicated negotiation, which involves further negotiations, should be allocated additional time.",
                "For example, the PC Manufacturer allocates a duration of 12 for the negotiation Order Hardware, and a duration of 4 for Deliver Computer.",
                "The reason is that the negotiation with the Distribution Center about Order Hardware is more complicated because it involves further negotiations between the Distribution Center and other agents.",
                "In our implementation, we use the following procedure to decide the negotiation duration δ(v): if(negCount(v) >= 3) // more additional negotiation needed δ(v) = (negCount(v)−1)∗basic neg cycle else if(negCount(v) > 0) // one or two additional negotiations needed δ(v) = 2 ∗ basic neg cycle else //no additional negotiation δ(v) = basic neg cycle + 1 basic neg cycle represents the minimum time needed for a negotiation cycle (proposal-think-reply), which is 3 in our system setting including communication delay.",
                "One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking.",
                "Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy.",
                "Evenly divide the available time among the n related negotiations: δ(v) = total available time/n For example, if the current time is 0, and the negotiation deadline for Order Computer is 21, given two other related negotiations, Order Hardware and Deliver Computer, each negotiation is allocated with a duration of 7.",
                "Intuitively we feel the strategy 1 may not be a good one, because performing all negotiations in parallel would increase the risk of decommitment and hence also decommitment penalties.",
                "However, it is not very clear how strategy 2 and 3 perform, and we will discuss some experimental results in Section 5. 5.",

                "This setting creates multiple concurrent negotiation chain situations; there is one long chain: Customer - Store - PC Manufacturer - Distribution Center - Producers - Transporter and two short chains: Customer - Store - Memory Producer This demonstrates that this mechanism is capable of handling multiple concurrent negotiation chains.",
                "All agents perform better in this example (gain more utility) when they are using the meta-level information to adjust their local control through the parameters in the success probability function (meta-info-flex policy).",

                "When the agent has a better understanding of the global negotiation scenario, it is able to allocate more flexibility for those tasks that involve complicated negotiations and resource contentions.",
                "Therefore, the success probability increases and fewer tasks are rejected or canceled (90% of the tasks have been successfully negotiated over when using meta-level information, compared to 39% when no pre-negotiation is used), resulting in both the agent and the system achieving better performance.",

                "How much time the Store Agent would like to spend on the negotiation Order Computer is its duration, and also determines the negotiation deadline for the PC Manufacturer.",
                "Now the question arises: how should an agent decide how much time it should spend on each negotiation, which actually affects the other agents negotiation decisions.",
                "The original model does not handle this question since it assumes the negotiation duration δ(v) is known.",
                "Here we propose three different approaches to handle this issue. 1. same-deadline policy.",
                "Use the same negotiation deadline for all related negotiations, which means allocate all available time to all negotiations: δ(v) = total available time For example if the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer is 20, the Store Agent will tell the PC Manufacturer to reply by 20 for Order Computer (ignoring the communication delay).",
                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",
                "Allocate time for each negotiation according to the meta-level information transferred in the pre-negotiation phase.",
                "A more complicated negotiation, which involves further negotiations, should be allocated additional time.",
                "For example, the PC Manufacturer allocates a duration of 12 for the negotiation Order Hardware, and a duration of 4 for Deliver Computer.",
                "The reason is that the negotiation with the Distribution Center about Order Hardware is more complicated because it involves further negotiations between the Distribution Center and other agents.",
                "In our implementation, we use the following procedure to decide the negotiation duration δ(v): if(negCount(v) >= 3) // more additional negotiation needed δ(v) = (negCount(v)−1)∗basic neg cycle else if(negCount(v) > 0) // one or two additional negotiations needed δ(v) = 2 ∗ basic neg cycle else //no additional negotiation δ(v) = basic neg cycle + 1 basic neg cycle represents the minimum time needed for a negotiation cycle (proposal-think-reply), which is 3 in our system setting including communication delay.",
                "One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking.",
                "Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy.",
                "Evenly divide the available time among the n related negotiations: δ(v) = total available time/n For example, if the current time is 0, and the negotiation deadline for Order Computer is 21, given two other related negotiations, Order Hardware and Deliver Computer, each negotiation is allocated with a duration of 7.",
                "Intuitively we feel the strategy 1 may not be a good one, because performing all negotiations in parallel would increase the risk of decommitment and hence also decommitment penalties.",
                "However, it is not very clear how strategy 2 and 3 perform, and we will discuss some experimental results in Section 5. 5.",

                "A search algorithm [10] and a set of partial order scheduling algorithms are used to handle these attributes.",
                "We tried two different flexibility policies. 1. fixed-flexibility policy: the agent uses a fixed value as the success probability (ps(v) = pbs(v)), according to its local knowledge and estimation. 2. meta-info-flexibility policy: the agent uses the function ps(v) = pbs(v) ∗ (2/π) ∗ (arctan(f(v) + c))) to model the success probability.",

                "The decommitment penalty rate is randomly generated in the range of [0, 1].",
                "This setting creates multiple concurrent <br>negotiation chain</br> situations; there is one long chain: Customer - Store - PC Manufacturer - Distribution Center - Producers - Transporter and two short chains: Customer - Store - Memory Producer This demonstrates that this mechanism is capable of handling multiple concurrent negotiation chains.",
                "All agents perform better in this example (gain more utility) when they are using the meta-level information to adjust their local control through the parameters in the success probability function (meta-info-flex policy).",
                "Especially for those agents in the middle of the <br>negotiation chain</br>, such as the PC Manufacturer and the Distribution Center, the flexibility policy makes a significant difference.",
                "When the agent has a better understanding of the global negotiation scenario, it is able to allocate more flexibility for those tasks that involve complicated negotiations and resource contentions.",
                "Therefore, the success probability increases and fewer tasks are rejected or canceled (90% of the tasks have been successfully negotiated over when using meta-level information, compared to 39% when no pre-negotiation is used), resulting in both the agent and the system achieving better performance.",
                "In the second set of experiments studies, we compare three negotiation deadline policies described in Section 4.2 when using the meta-info flexibility policy described above.",

                "When the agent uses the meta-info-deadline policy, complicated negotiations are allocated more time and, correspondingly, simpler negotiations are allocated less time.",
                "This also has the effect of allowing some negotiations to be performed in sequence.",
                "The consequence of sequencing negotiation is that, if there is failure, an agent can simply cancel the other related negotiations that have not been started.",

                "In the evenly-divideddeadline policy, the agent allocates negotiation time evenly among the related negotiations, hence the complicated negotiation does not get enough time to complete.",

                "We defined a quantitative measure called flexibility: Given a task t, suppose the allocated time range for t is [est, dl], est is the earliest start time and dl stands for the deadline, flexibility(t) = dl − est − process time(t) process time(t) (3) Flexibility is an important attribute because it directly affects the possible outcome of the negotiation.",
                "The success probability of a negotiation can be described as a function of the flexibility.",
                "In this work, we adopt the following formula for the success probability function based on the flexibility of the negotiation issue: ps(v) = pbs(v) ∗ (2/π) ∗ (arctan(f(v) + c))) (4) This function describes a phenomenon where initially the likelihood of a successful negotiation increases significantly as the flexibility grows, and then levels off afterward, which mirrors our experience from previous experiments. pbs is the basic success probability of this negotiation v when the flexibility f(v) is very large. c is a parameter used to adjust the relationship.",
                "Different function patterns can result from different parameter values, as shown in Figure 5.",
                "This function describes the agents assumption about how the other agent involved in this negotiation would response to this particular negotiation request, when it has flexibility f(v).",
                "This function is part of the agents local model about other agents.",
                "To improve the accuracy of this function and make it closer to the reality, the agent adjusts these two values according to the meta-level information transferred during pre-negotiation phase.",
                "The values of c depends on whether there is further negotiation involved and whether there are other tasks competing with this task for common resources.",
                "If so, more flexibility is needed for this issue and hence c should be assigned a smaller value.",
                "In our implementation, the following procedure is used to calculate c based on the meta-level information negCount and PnoConflict: if(PnoConflict > 0.99) // no other competing task c = Clarge − negCount else // competing task exists c = Csmall This procedure works as follows: when there is no other competing Figure 5: Different Success Probability Functions task, c depends on the number of additional negotiations needed.",
                "The more additional negotiations that are needed, the smaller value c has, hence more flexibility will be assigned to this issue to ensure the negotiation success.",
                "If no more negotiation is needed, c is assigned to a large number Clarge, meaning that less flexibility is needed for this issue.",
                "When there are other competing tasks, c is assigned to a small number Csmall, meaning that more flexibility is needed for this issue.",
                "In our experimental work, we have Clarge as 5 and Csmall as 1.",
                "These values are selected according to our experience; however, a more practical approach is to have agents learn and dynamically adjust these values.",
                "This is also part of our future work. pbs is calculated based on PnoConflict, f(v) (the flexibility of v in previous negotiation), and c, using the reverse format of equation 4. pbs(v) = min(1.0, PnoConflict(v)∗(π/2)/(arctan(f(v)+c))) (5) For example, based on the scenario described above, the agents have the following values for c and pbs based on the meta-level information transferred: • PC Manufacturer, Order Hardware: pbs = 1.0, c = 2; • Distribution Center, Order Chips: pbs = 1.0, c = 5; • Store Agent, Order Memory: pbs = 0.79, c = 1; Figure 5 shows the different patterns of the success probability function given different parameter values.",
                "Based on such patterns, the Store Agent would allocate more flexibility to the task Order Memory to increase the likelihood of success in negotiation.",

                "Use the same negotiation deadline for all related negotiations, which means allocate all available time to all negotiations: δ(v) = total available time For example if the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer is 20, the Store Agent will tell the PC Manufacturer to reply by 20 for Order Computer (ignoring the communication delay).",
                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",

                "The reason is that the negotiation with the Distribution Center about Order Hardware is more complicated because it involves further negotiations between the Distribution Center and other agents.",
                "In our implementation, we use the following procedure to decide the negotiation duration δ(v): if(negCount(v) >= 3) // more additional negotiation needed δ(v) = (negCount(v)−1)∗basic neg cycle else if(negCount(v) > 0) // one or two additional negotiations needed δ(v) = 2 ∗ basic neg cycle else //no additional negotiation δ(v) = basic neg cycle + 1 basic neg cycle represents the minimum time needed for a negotiation cycle (proposal-think-reply), which is 3 in our system setting including communication delay.",
                "One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking.",
                "Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy.",
                "Evenly divide the available time among the n related negotiations: δ(v) = total available time/n For example, if the current time is 0, and the negotiation deadline for Order Computer is 21, given two other related negotiations, Order Hardware and Deliver Computer, each negotiation is allocated with a duration of 7.",
                "Intuitively we feel the strategy 1 may not be a good one, because performing all negotiations in parallel would increase the risk of decommitment and hence also decommitment penalties.",

                "This setting creates multiple concurrent negotiation chain situations; there is one long chain: Customer - Store - PC Manufacturer - Distribution Center - Producers - Transporter and two short chains: Customer - Store - Memory Producer This demonstrates that this mechanism is capable of handling multiple concurrent negotiation chains.",
                "All agents perform better in this example (gain more utility) when they are using the meta-level information to adjust their local control through the parameters in the success probability function (meta-info-flex policy).",

                "To improve the accuracy of this function and make it closer to the reality, the agent adjusts these two values according to the meta-level information transferred during <br>pre-negotiation</br> phase.",

                "In our implementation, the following procedure is used to calculate c based on the meta-level information negCount and PnoConflict: if(PnoConflict > 0.99) // no other competing task c = Clarge − negCount else // competing task exists c = Csmall This procedure works as follows: when there is no other competing Figure 5: Different Success Probability Functions task, c depends on the number of additional negotiations needed.",
                "The more additional negotiations that are needed, the smaller value c has, hence more flexibility will be assigned to this issue to ensure the negotiation success.",

                "In our experimental work, we have Clarge as 5 and Csmall as 1.",
                "These values are selected according to our experience; however, a more practical approach is to have agents learn and dynamically adjust these values.",
                "This is also part of our future work. pbs is calculated based on PnoConflict, f(v) (the flexibility of v in previous negotiation), and c, using the reverse format of equation 4. pbs(v) = min(1.0, PnoConflict(v)∗(π/2)/(arctan(f(v)+c))) (5) For example, based on the scenario described above, the agents have the following values for c and pbs based on the meta-level information transferred: • PC Manufacturer, Order Hardware: pbs = 1.0, c = 2; • Distribution Center, Order Chips: pbs = 1.0, c = 5; • Store Agent, Order Memory: pbs = 0.79, c = 1; Figure 5 shows the different patterns of the success probability function given different parameter values.",

                "The original model does not handle this question since it assumes the negotiation duration δ(v) is known.",
                "Here we propose three different approaches to handle this issue. 1. same-deadline policy.",
                "Use the same negotiation deadline for all related negotiations, which means allocate all available time to all negotiations: δ(v) = total available time For example if the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer is 20, the Store Agent will tell the PC Manufacturer to reply by 20 for Order Computer (ignoring the communication delay).",
                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",

                "The reason is that the negotiation with the Distribution Center about Order Hardware is more complicated because it involves further negotiations between the Distribution Center and other agents.",
                "In our implementation, we use the following procedure to decide the negotiation duration δ(v): if(negCount(v) >= 3) // more additional negotiation needed δ(v) = (negCount(v)−1)∗basic neg cycle else if(negCount(v) > 0) // one or two additional negotiations needed δ(v) = 2 ∗ basic neg cycle else //no additional negotiation δ(v) = basic neg cycle + 1 basic neg cycle represents the minimum time needed for a negotiation cycle (proposal-think-reply), which is 3 in our system setting including communication delay.",
                "One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking.",
                "Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy.",

                "Intuitively we feel the strategy 1 may not be a good one, because performing all negotiations in parallel would increase the risk of decommitment and hence also decommitment penalties.",

                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",

                "One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking.",
                "Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy.",

                "Another major difference between this work and other work on negotiation is that negotiation, here, is not viewed as a stand-alone process.",

                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",

                "This process can go back and forth until an agreement is reached or the agents decide to stop.",
                "If an agreement is reached and one agent cannot fulfill the commitment, it needs to pay the other party a decommitment penalty as specified in the commitment.",

                "The original model does not handle this question since it assumes the negotiation duration δ(v) is known.",
                "Here we propose three different approaches to handle this issue. 1. same-deadline policy.",
                "Use the same negotiation deadline for all related negotiations, which means allocate all available time to all negotiations: δ(v) = total available time For example if the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer is 20, the Store Agent will tell the PC Manufacturer to reply by 20 for Order Computer (ignoring the communication delay).",
                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",

                "The reason is that the negotiation with the Distribution Center about Order Hardware is more complicated because it involves further negotiations between the Distribution Center and other agents.",
                "In our implementation, we use the following procedure to decide the negotiation duration δ(v): if(negCount(v) >= 3) // more additional negotiation needed δ(v) = (negCount(v)−1)∗basic neg cycle else if(negCount(v) > 0) // one or two additional negotiations needed δ(v) = 2 ∗ basic neg cycle else //no additional negotiation δ(v) = basic neg cycle + 1 basic neg cycle represents the minimum time needed for a negotiation cycle (proposal-think-reply), which is 3 in our system setting including communication delay.",
                "One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking.",
                "Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy.",
                "Evenly divide the available time among the n related negotiations: δ(v) = total available time/n For example, if the current time is 0, and the negotiation deadline for Order Computer is 21, given two other related negotiations, Order Hardware and Deliver Computer, each negotiation is allocated with a duration of 7.",
                "Intuitively we feel the strategy 1 may not be a good one, because performing all negotiations in parallel would increase the risk of decommitment and hence also decommitment penalties.",

                "How long the negotiation on Order Computer takes depends on how the PC Manufacturer handles its local multiple negotiations: whether it replies to the Store Agent first or waits until all other related negotiations have been settled.",
                "However, the ordering of negotiations depends on the negotiation deadline on Order Computer, which should be provided by the Store Agent.",
                "The negotiation deadline of Order Computer for the PC Manufacturer is actually decided based on the negotiation duration of Order Computer for the Store Agent.",
                "How much time the Store Agent would like to spend on the negotiation Order Computer is its duration, and also determines the negotiation deadline for the PC Manufacturer.",
                "Now the question arises: how should an agent decide how much time it should spend on each negotiation, which actually affects the other agents negotiation decisions.",
                "The original model does not handle this question since it assumes the negotiation duration δ(v) is known.",
                "Here we propose three different approaches to handle this issue. 1. same-deadline policy.",
                "Use the same negotiation deadline for all related negotiations, which means allocate all available time to all negotiations: δ(v) = total available time For example if the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer is 20, the Store Agent will tell the PC Manufacturer to reply by 20 for Order Computer (ignoring the communication delay).",
                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",
                "Allocate time for each negotiation according to the meta-level information transferred in the pre-negotiation phase.",
                "A more complicated negotiation, which involves further negotiations, should be allocated additional time.",
                "For example, the PC Manufacturer allocates a duration of 12 for the negotiation Order Hardware, and a duration of 4 for Deliver Computer.",
                "The reason is that the negotiation with the Distribution Center about Order Hardware is more complicated because it involves further negotiations between the Distribution Center and other agents.",
                "In our implementation, we use the following procedure to decide the negotiation duration δ(v): if(negCount(v) >= 3) // more additional negotiation needed δ(v) = (negCount(v)−1)∗basic neg cycle else if(negCount(v) > 0) // one or two additional negotiations needed δ(v) = 2 ∗ basic neg cycle else //no additional negotiation δ(v) = basic neg cycle + 1 basic neg cycle represents the minimum time needed for a negotiation cycle (proposal-think-reply), which is 3 in our system setting including communication delay.",
                "One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking.",
                "Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy.",
                "Evenly divide the available time among the n related negotiations: δ(v) = total available time/n For example, if the current time is 0, and the negotiation deadline for Order Computer is 21, given two other related negotiations, Order Hardware and Deliver Computer, each negotiation is allocated with a duration of 7.",
                "Intuitively we feel the strategy 1 may not be a good one, because performing all negotiations in parallel would increase the risk of decommitment and hence also decommitment penalties.",
                "However, it is not very clear how strategy 2 and 3 perform, and we will discuss some experimental results in Section 5. 5.",

                "This setting creates multiple concurrent negotiation chain situations; there is one long chain: Customer - Store - PC Manufacturer - Distribution Center - Producers - Transporter and two short chains: Customer - Store - Memory Producer This demonstrates that this mechanism is capable of handling multiple concurrent negotiation chains.",
                "All agents perform better in this example (gain more utility) when they are using the meta-level information to adjust their local control through the parameters in the success probability function (meta-info-flex policy).",
                "Especially for those agents in the middle of the negotiation chain, such as the PC Manufacturer and the Distribution Center, the flexibility policy makes a significant difference.",
                "When the agent has a better understanding of the global negotiation scenario, it is able to allocate more flexibility for those tasks that involve complicated negotiations and resource contentions.",
                "Therefore, the success probability increases and fewer tasks are rejected or canceled (90% of the tasks have been successfully negotiated over when using meta-level information, compared to 39% when no pre-negotiation is used), resulting in both the agent and the system achieving better performance.",

                "When the Store Agent negotiates with the PC Manufacturer about Order Computer, what negotiation deadline should it specify?",
                "How long the negotiation on Order Computer takes depends on how the PC Manufacturer handles its local multiple negotiations: whether it replies to the Store Agent first or waits until all other related negotiations have been settled.",
                "However, the ordering of negotiations depends on the negotiation deadline on Order Computer, which should be provided by the Store Agent.",
                "The negotiation deadline of Order Computer for the PC Manufacturer is actually decided based on the negotiation duration of Order Computer for the Store Agent.",
                "How much time the Store Agent would like to spend on the negotiation Order Computer is its duration, and also determines the negotiation deadline for the PC Manufacturer.",
                "Now the question arises: how should an agent decide how much time it should spend on each negotiation, which actually affects the other agents negotiation decisions.",
                "The original model does not handle this question since it assumes the negotiation duration δ(v) is known.",
                "Here we propose three different approaches to handle this issue. 1. same-deadline policy.",
                "Use the same negotiation deadline for all related negotiations, which means allocate all available time to all negotiations: δ(v) = total available time For example if the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer is 20, the Store Agent will tell the PC Manufacturer to reply by 20 for Order Computer (ignoring the communication delay).",
                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",
                "Allocate time for each negotiation according to the meta-level information transferred in the pre-negotiation phase.",
                "A more complicated negotiation, which involves further negotiations, should be allocated additional time.",
                "For example, the PC Manufacturer allocates a duration of 12 for the negotiation Order Hardware, and a duration of 4 for Deliver Computer.",
                "The reason is that the negotiation with the Distribution Center about Order Hardware is more complicated because it involves further negotiations between the Distribution Center and other agents.",
                "In our implementation, we use the following procedure to decide the negotiation duration δ(v): if(negCount(v) >= 3) // more additional negotiation needed δ(v) = (negCount(v)−1)∗basic neg cycle else if(negCount(v) > 0) // one or two additional negotiations needed δ(v) = 2 ∗ basic neg cycle else //no additional negotiation δ(v) = basic neg cycle + 1 basic neg cycle represents the minimum time needed for a negotiation cycle (proposal-think-reply), which is 3 in our system setting including communication delay.",
                "One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking.",
                "Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy.",
                "Evenly divide the available time among the n related negotiations: δ(v) = total available time/n For example, if the current time is 0, and the negotiation deadline for Order Computer is 21, given two other related negotiations, Order Hardware and Deliver Computer, each negotiation is allocated with a duration of 7.",
                "Intuitively we feel the strategy 1 may not be a good one, because performing all negotiations in parallel would increase the risk of decommitment and hence also decommitment penalties.",
                "However, it is not very clear how strategy 2 and 3 perform, and we will discuss some experimental results in Section 5. 5.",

                "This setting creates multiple concurrent negotiation chain situations; there is one long chain: Customer - Store - PC Manufacturer - Distribution Center - Producers - Transporter and two short chains: Customer - Store - Memory Producer This demonstrates that this mechanism is capable of handling multiple concurrent negotiation chains.",
                "All agents perform better in this example (gain more utility) when they are using the meta-level information to adjust their local control through the parameters in the success probability function (meta-info-flex policy).",
                "Especially for those agents in the middle of the negotiation chain, such as the PC Manufacturer and the Distribution Center, the flexibility policy makes a significant difference.",
                "When the agent has a better understanding of the global negotiation scenario, it is able to allocate more flexibility for those tasks that involve complicated negotiations and resource contentions.",
                "Therefore, the success probability increases and fewer tasks are rejected or canceled (90% of the tasks have been successfully negotiated over when using meta-level information, compared to 39% when no pre-negotiation is used), resulting in both the agent and the system achieving better performance.",

                "Use the same negotiation deadline for all related negotiations, which means allocate all available time to all negotiations: δ(v) = total available time For example if the negotiation deadline for Purchase Computer is 20, the Store Agent will tell the PC Manufacturer to reply by 20 for Order Computer (ignoring the communication delay).",
                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",

                "The reason is that the negotiation with the Distribution Center about Order Hardware is more complicated because it involves further negotiations between the Distribution Center and other agents.",
                "In our implementation, we use the following procedure to decide the negotiation duration δ(v): if(negCount(v) >= 3) // more additional negotiation needed δ(v) = (negCount(v)−1)∗basic neg cycle else if(negCount(v) > 0) // one or two additional negotiations needed δ(v) = 2 ∗ basic neg cycle else //no additional negotiation δ(v) = basic neg cycle + 1 basic neg cycle represents the minimum time needed for a negotiation cycle (proposal-think-reply), which is 3 in our system setting including communication delay.",
                "One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking.",
                "Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy.",
                "Evenly divide the available time among the n related negotiations: δ(v) = total available time/n For example, if the current time is 0, and the negotiation deadline for Order Computer is 21, given two other related negotiations, Order Hardware and Deliver Computer, each negotiation is allocated with a duration of 7.",
                "Intuitively we feel the strategy 1 may not be a good one, because performing all negotiations in parallel would increase the risk of decommitment and hence also decommitment penalties.",

                "This setting creates multiple concurrent negotiation chain situations; there is one long chain: Customer - Store - PC Manufacturer - Distribution Center - Producers - Transporter and two short chains: Customer - Store - Memory Producer This demonstrates that this mechanism is capable of handling multiple concurrent negotiation chains.",
                "All agents perform better in this example (gain more utility) when they are using the meta-level information to adjust their local control through the parameters in the success probability function (meta-info-flex policy).",

                "Therefore, the success probability increases and fewer tasks are rejected or canceled (90% of the tasks have been successfully negotiated over when using meta-level information, compared to 39% when no pre-negotiation is used), resulting in both the agent and the system achieving better performance.",

                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",

                "The reason is that the negotiation with the Distribution Center about Order Hardware is more complicated because it involves further negotiations between the Distribution Center and other agents.",
                "In our implementation, we use the following procedure to decide the negotiation duration δ(v): if(negCount(v) >= 3) // more additional negotiation needed δ(v) = (negCount(v)−1)∗basic neg cycle else if(negCount(v) > 0) // one or two additional negotiations needed δ(v) = 2 ∗ basic neg cycle else //no additional negotiation δ(v) = basic neg cycle + 1 basic neg cycle represents the minimum time needed for a negotiation cycle (proposal-think-reply), which is 3 in our system setting including communication delay.",
                "One additional time unit is allocated for the simplest negotiation because it allows the agent to perform a more complicated reasoning process in thinking.",
                "Again, the structure of this procedure is selected according to experience, and it can be learned and adjusted by agents dynamically. 3. evenly-divided-deadline policy.",

                "This setting creates multiple concurrent negotiation chain situations; there is one long chain: Customer - Store - PC Manufacturer - Distribution Center - Producers - Transporter and two short chains: Customer - Store - Memory Producer This demonstrates that this mechanism is capable of handling multiple concurrent negotiation chains.",
                "All agents perform better in this example (gain more utility) when they are using the meta-level information to adjust their local control through the parameters in the success probability function (meta-info-flex policy).",

                "This strategy allows every negotiation to have the largest possible duration, however it also eliminates the possibility of performing negotiations in sequence - all negotiations need to be performed in parallel because the total available time is the same as the duration of each negotiation. 2. meta-info-deadline policy.",

                "RELATED WORK Fatima, Wooldridge and Jennings [1] studied the multiple issues in negotiation in terms of the agenda and negotiation procedure.",
                "However, this work is limited since it only involves a single agents perspective without any understanding that the agent may be part of a negotiation chain.",
                "Mailler and Lesser [4] have presented an approach to a distributed resource allocation problem where the negotiation chain scenario occurs.",
                "It models the negotiation problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) and a cooperative mediation mechanism is used to centralize relevant portions of the DCOP.",
                "In our work, the negotiation involves more complicated issues such as reward, penalty and utility; also, we adopt a distribution approach where no centralized control is needed.",
                "A mediator-based partial centralized approach has been applied to the coordination and scheduling of complex task network [8], which is different from our work since the system is a complete cooperative system and individual utility of single agent is not concerned at all.",
                "A combinatorial auction [2, 9] could be another approach to solving the negotiation chain problem.",
                "However, in a combinatorial auction, the agent does not reason about the ordering of negotiations.",
                "This would lead to a problem similar to those we discussed when the same-deadline policy is used. 7.",
                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we have solved negotiation chain problems by extending our multi-linked negotiation model from the perspective of a single agent to multiple agents.",
                "Instead of solving the negotiation chain problem in a centralized approach, we adopt a distributed approach where each agent has an extended local model and decisionmaking process.",
                "We have introduced a pre-negotiation phase that allows agents to transfer meta-level information on related negotiation issues.",
                "Using this information, the agent can build a more accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the relationship of flexibility and success probability.",
                "This more accurate model helps the agent in choosing the appropriate negotiation solution.",
                "The experimental data shows that these mechanisms improve the agents and the systems overall performance significantly.",
                "In future extension of this work, we would like to develop mechanisms to verify how reliable the agents are.",
                "We also recognize that the current approach of applying the meta-level information is mainly heuristic, so we would like to develop a learning mechanism that enables the agent to learn how to use such information to adjust its local model from previous experience.",
                "To further verify this distributed approach, we would like to develop a centralized approach, so we can evaluate how good the solution from this distributed approach is compared to the optimal solution found by the centralized approach. 8.",
