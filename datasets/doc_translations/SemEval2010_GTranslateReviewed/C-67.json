With a student to computer ratio of better than 2-to-1, the Ringling School has achieved national recognition for its large-scale integration of technology into collegiate visual art and design education. We have found that Mac OS X is the best operating system to train future artists and designers. Moreover, we can now buy Macs to run high-end graphics, nonlinear video editing, animation, multimedia, web production, and digital video applications rather than expensive UNIX workstations. As visual artists cross from paint on canvas to creating in the digital realm, the demand for a highperformance computing environment grows. In our public computer laboratories, students use the computers most often during the workday; at night and on weekends the computers see only light use. In order to harness the lost processing time for tasks such as video rendering, we are testing Xgrid, a suite of Mac OS X applications recently developed by Apple for parallel and distributed high-performance computing. As with any new technology deployment, IT managers need to consider a number of factors as they assess, plan, and implement Xgrid. Therefore, we would like to share valuable information we learned from our implementation of an Xgrid environment with our colleagues. In our report, we will address issues such as assessing the needs for grid computing, potential applications, management tools, security, authentication, integration into existing infrastructure, application support, user training, and user support. Furthermore, we will discuss the issues that arose and the lessons learned during and after the implementation process.

The technology behind grid computing model is not new. Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times. Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid. Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing. Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance. The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system. In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary. There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters. Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task. In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service. If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload. For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site. Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down. A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer. Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve. An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated. The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network. A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks. Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service. A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate. The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing. In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems. The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet. In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use. The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper. A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid. A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well. The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems. In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2. ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks. The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel. Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution. Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation. This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results. In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results. Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform. Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid. Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X. Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements. This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid. By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes. How many licenses will be required? Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members. The controller must be able to see members on the network. This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3. XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation. It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple. In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5]. Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration. If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6]. Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line. A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid. It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator. The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation. However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent. Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role. In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode. The more typical production use is called cluster mode. The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line. The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid. If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client. When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller. A client can only connect to a single controller at a time. The controller runs the GridServer process. It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task. In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections. Only one controller can exist per logical grid. The agents run the GridAgent process. When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time. Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller. An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords. First, a client needs a password to access a controller. Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent. Either password requirement can be disabled. Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes. At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords. As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts. There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers. This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents. Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents. The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions. Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes. In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8]. The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization. This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences. Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected. By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host. The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle. In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes. Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority. However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost. Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid. Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist. This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line. The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins. Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in. If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in. James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8]. Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user. The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run. Another important parameter is the working directory. This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network. The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small. If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed. The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome. However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work. The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic. This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents. Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task. Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody. Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple. If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory. When the task is complete, the results are available to the client. In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command. If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent. When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations. Apple acknowledges some limitations [7]. For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent. Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work. Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations. At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids. There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent. The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress. Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid. The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4. XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya. The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs. The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s. All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems. We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10]. Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload. Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests. Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM. As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents. Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid. Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning. We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid. Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8]. Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes. Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes. However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent. These results gave us two important pieces of information. First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents. All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same. Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray. Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent. Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application. However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed. We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload. The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications. This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use. In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya. The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user. For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya. Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files. If the directory does not Figure 1. Xgrid test grid. Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations. However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory. Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya. This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it. Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions. We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames. This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory. Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution. Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid. The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments. Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size). The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents. For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents. Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job. The results are sent to the network volume. With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid. Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of render. • Check whether the render can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial. The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered. Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid. The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody. The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume. The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents. Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent. Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior. We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5. FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School. In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in. This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller. This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid. Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6. CONCLUSION Grid computing continues to advance. Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications. For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems. Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining. The National Virtual Collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers across the U.S. with computing resources, allowing them to share extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together as virtual teams over the Internet. There is an assortment of new grid players in the IT world expanding the grid computing model and advancing the grid technology to the next level. SAP [14] is piloting a project to grid-enable SAP ERP applications, Dell [15] has partnered with Platform Computing to consolidate computing resources and provide grid-enabled systems for compute intensive applications, Oracle has integrated support for grid computing in their 10g release [16], United Devices [17] offers hosting service for gridon-demand, and Sun Microsystems continues their research and development of Suns N1 Grid engine [18] which combines grid and clustering platforms. Simply, the grid computing is up and coming. The potential benefits of grid computing are colossal in higher education learning while the implementation costs are low. Today, it would be difficult to identify an application with as high a return on investment as grid computing in information technology divisions in higher education institutions. It is a mistake to overlook this technology with such a high payback. 123 7.

Con una relación estudiante / informática de Better de 2 a 1, la escuela Ringling ha logrado el reconocimiento nacional por su integración a gran escala de la tecnología en la educación universitaria de arte visual y diseño. Hemos descubierto que Mac OS X es el mejor sistema operativo para capacitar a futuros artistas y diseñadores. Además, ahora podemos comprar Macs para ejecutar gráficos de alta gama, edición de video no lineal, animación, multimedia, producción web y aplicaciones de video digital en lugar de costosas estaciones de trabajo de Unix. A medida que los artistas visuales se cruzan desde la pintura en el lienzo hasta la creación en el ámbito digital, crece la demanda de un entorno informático de alto rendimiento. En nuestros laboratorios públicos de computación, los estudiantes usan las computadoras con mayor frecuencia durante la jornada laboral;Por la noche y los fines de semana las computadoras solo ven el uso de luz. Para aprovechar el tiempo de procesamiento perdido para tareas como la representación de video, estamos probando XGRID, un conjunto de aplicaciones Mac OS X desarrolladas recientemente por Apple para la computación de alto rendimiento paralela y distribuida. Al igual que con cualquier nueva implementación de tecnología, los gerentes de TI deben considerar una serie de factores a medida que evalúan, planifican e implementan XGRID. Por lo tanto, nos gustaría compartir información valiosa que aprendimos de nuestra implementación de un entorno XGrid con nuestros colegas.

Introducción La computación de la cuadrícula no tiene una definición única y universalmente aceptada. La tecnología detrás del modelo de computación de la red no es nueva. Sus raíces se encuentran en modelos de computación distribuidos temprano que datan de principios de la década de 1980, donde los científicos aprovecharon el poder informático de las estaciones de trabajo inactivas para permitir calcular aplicaciones intensivas para que se ejecute en múltiples estaciones de trabajo, que acortaron drásticamente los tiempos de procesamiento. Aunque numerosos modelos de computación distribuidos estaban disponibles para aplicaciones científicas específicas de disciplina, solo recientemente las herramientas estuvieron disponibles para usar aplicaciones de propósito general en una cuadrícula. En consecuencia, el modelo de computación de la cuadrícula está ganando popularidad y se ha convertido en una pieza de computación de utilidad. Dado que en la industria de TI, varios modelos de computación se usan indistintamente con la computación de la cuadrícula, primero ordenamos las similitudes y la diferencia entre estos modelos de computación para que la computación de la cuadrícula se pueda colocar en perspectiva.1.1 Clúster Un clúster es un grupo de máquinas en una configuración fija unida para operar y se gestiona como una entidad única para aumentar la robustez y el rendimiento. El clúster aparece como un solo sistema de alta velocidad o un solo sistema altamente disponible. En este modelo, los recursos no pueden ingresar y dejar al grupo según sea necesario. Hay al menos dos tipos de grupos: grupos paralelos y grupos de alta disponibilidad. Las máquinas agrupadas generalmente están en proximidad espacial, como en la misma sala de servidores, y dedicadas exclusivamente a su tarea. En un clúster de alta disponibilidad, cada máquina proporciona el mismo servicio. Si una máquina falla, otra se hace cargo de su carga de trabajo sin problemas. Por ejemplo, cada computadora podría ser un servidor web para un sitio web. Si un servidor web muere, otro proporciona el servicio, de modo que el sitio web rara vez, si alguna vez, disminuye. Un clúster paralelo es un tipo de supercomputadora. Los problemas se dividen en muchas partes, y los miembros individuales del clúster reciben parte del problema para resolver. Un ejemplo de un clúster paralelo se compone de computadoras Apple Power Mac G5 en la Universidad de Virginia Tech [1].1.2 Computación distribuida La computación distribuida expande espacialmente los servicios de red para que los componentes que proporcionan los servicios estén separados. El objetivo principal de este modelo de computación es consolidar la potencia de procesamiento a través de una red. Un ejemplo simple es difundir servicios como archivos e impresiones, porción web y almacenamiento de datos en múltiples máquinas en lugar de una sola máquina que maneja todas las tareas. La computación distribuida también puede ser más de grano fino, donde incluso una sola aplicación se divide en piezas y cada parte ubicada en diferentes máquinas: un procesador de textos en un servidor, un corrector ortográfico en un segundo servidor, etc. 1.3 Computación de utilidad literalmente, utilidadLa informática se asemeja a los servicios públicos comunes, como el teléfono o el servicio eléctrico. Un proveedor de servicios hace que la gestión de recursos informáticos y de infraestructura esté disponible para un cliente según sea necesario, y cobra por uso en lugar de una tarifa plana. Lo importante a tener en cuenta es que los recursos solo se usan según sea necesario y no se dedican a un solo cliente.1.4 Computación de la cuadrícula La computación de la cuadrícula contiene aspectos de grupos, computación distribuida y computación de servicios públicos. En el sentido más básico, Grid convierte a un grupo de sistemas heterogéneos en un entorno informático administrado centralmente pero flexible que puede funcionar en tareas demasiado tiempo para los sistemas individuales. Los miembros de la cuadrícula no están necesariamente en las proximidades, sino que simplemente deben ser accesibles en una red;La cuadrícula puede acceder a las computadoras en una LAN, WAN o en cualquier parte del mundo a través de Internet. Además, las computadoras que comprenden la red no necesitan dedicarse a la cuadrícula;Más bien, pueden funcionar como estaciones de trabajo normales y luego anunciar su disponibilidad a la red cuando no están en uso. La última característica es la más fundamental para la cuadrícula descrita en este documento. Un ejemplo bien conocido de dicha cuadrícula ad hoc es el proyecto Seti@Home [2] de la Universidad de California en Berkeley, que permite a cualquier persona en el mundo una computadora y una conexión a Internet donar tiempo de procesador no utilizado para analizar la radioDatos del telescopio.1.5 Comparación de la cuadrícula y el clúster una cuadrícula de computadora expande las capacidades del clúster perdiendo sus límites espaciales, de modo que cualquier computadora accesible a través de la red gana el potencial de aumentar la cuadrícula. Una característica de la red fundamental es que escala bien. La potencia de procesamiento de cualquier máquina agregada a la cuadrícula está inmediatamente disponible para resolver problemas. Además, las máquinas en la cuadrícula pueden ser estaciones de trabajo de pospose generales, que mantienen bajos el costo de expandir la red.2. Evaluar la necesidad de calcular la cuadrícula El uso efectivo de una cuadrícula requiere un cálculo que se pueda dividir en tareas independientes (es decir, paralelas). Los resultados de cada tarea no pueden depender de los resultados de ninguna otra tarea, por lo que los miembros de la red pueden resolver las tareas en paralelo. Una vez que las tareas se han completado, los resultados se pueden ensamblar en la solución. Ejemplos de cálculos paralelizables son el conjunto de fractales Mandelbrot, los cálculos de Monte Carlo utilizados en disciplinas como la física de estado sólido y los marcos individuales de una animación renderizada. Este documento se refiere al último ejemplo.2.1 Aplicaciones apropiadas para la computación de la red Las aplicaciones utilizadas en la computación de la red deben diseñarse específicamente para uso de la red, o scriptable de tal manera que puedan recibir datos de la red, procesar los datos y luego devolver los resultados. En otras palabras, los mejores candidatos para la computación de la cuadrícula son aplicaciones que ejecutan los mismos cálculos o muy similares en una gran cantidad de datos sin dependencias de los resultados calculados anteriores. Las aplicaciones que dependen en gran medida del manejo de datos en lugar de la potencia de procesamiento generalmente son más adecuadas para ejecutarse en un entorno tradicional que en una plataforma de cuadrícula. Por supuesto, las aplicaciones también deben ejecutarse en la plataforma informática que aloja la cuadrícula. Nuestro interés es usar la aplicación alias maya [3] con manzanas xgrid [4] en Mac OS X. Las aplicaciones comerciales generalmente tienen requisitos estrictos de licencia. Esta es una preocupación importante si instalamos una aplicación comercial como Maya en todos los miembros de nuestra cuadrícula. Por su naturaleza, el tamaño de la cuadrícula puede cambiar a medida que cambia el número de computadoras inactivas. ¿Cuántas licencias se requerirán? Nuestra resolución de este tema se discutirá en una sección posterior.2.2 Integración en la infraestructura existente La cuadrícula requiere un controlador que reconozca cuándo los miembros de la cuadrícula están disponibles, y elimina el trabajo a los miembros disponibles. El controlador debe poder ver miembros en la red. Esto no requiere que los miembros estén en la misma subred que el controlador, pero si no lo son, se deben configurar los firewalls y enrutadores intermedios para permitir el tráfico de la cuadrícula.3. XGRID XGRID es la implementación de la cuadrícula de manzanas. Fue inspirado en Zilla, una aplicación de agrupación de escritorio desarrollada por Next y adquirida por Apple. En este informe describimos el XGRID Technology Preview 2, una descarga gratuita que requiere Mac OS X 10.2.8 o posterior y un mínimo de 128 MB RAM [5]. XGRID, aprovecha las manzanas facilidad tradicional de uso y configuración. Si los miembros de la cuadrícula están en la misma subred, de forma predeterminada, XGrid descubre automáticamente los recursos disponibles a través de Rendezvous [6]. Las tareas se envían a la cuadrícula a través de una interfaz GUI o por la línea de comando. Un panel de preferencia del sistema controla cuando cada computadora está disponible para la cuadrícula. Puede ser mejor ver a XGRID como facilitador. La arquitectura XGRID maneja el software y la distribución de datos, la ejecución del trabajo y la agregación de resultados. Sin embargo, XGRID no realiza los cálculos reales.3.1 Componentes XGRID XGRID tiene tres componentes principales: el cliente, el controlador y el agente. Cada componente se incluye en la instalación predeterminada, y cualquier computadora se puede configurar fácilmente para asumir cualquier rol. En 120 hechos, para fines de prueba, una computadora puede asumir simultáneamente todos los roles en modo local. El uso de producción más típico se llama modo de clúster. El cliente envía trabajos al controlador a través de la GUI XGRID o la línea de comando. El cliente define cómo el trabajo se dividirá en tareas para la cuadrícula. Si se deben enviar algún archivo o ejecutable como parte de un trabajo, deben residir en el cliente o en una ubicación accesible para el cliente. Cuando se completa un trabajo, el cliente puede recuperar los resultados del controlador. Un cliente solo puede conectarse a un solo controlador a la vez. El controlador ejecuta el proceso GridServer. Hace cola las tareas recibidas de los clientes, distribuye esas tareas a los agentes y maneja la conmutación por error si un agente no puede completar una tarea. En la vista previa de la tecnología XGRID 2, un controlador puede manejar un máximo de 10,000 conexiones de agente. Solo puede existir un controlador por cuadrícula lógica. Los agentes ejecutan el proceso gridagente. Cuando comienza el proceso gridagente, se registra con un controlador;Un agente solo se puede conectar a un controlador a la vez. Los agentes reciben tareas de su controlador, realizan los cálculos especificados y luego envían los resultados al controlador. Un agente se puede configurar para aceptar siempre tareas, o simplemente aceptarlas cuando la computadora no está ocupada.3.2 Seguridad y autenticación de forma predeterminada, XGrid requiere dos contraseñas. Primero, un cliente necesita una contraseña para acceder a un controlador. En segundo lugar, el controlador necesita una contraseña para acceder a un agente. Cualquiera de los requisitos de contraseña se puede deshabilitar. XGRID utiliza un protocolo de autenticación mutua en dos vías con hashes MD5. En este momento, el cifrado de datos solo se usa para contraseñas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, un agente se registra con un controlador cuando comienza el proceso gridagente. No existe un método nativo para que el controlador rechace a los agentes, por lo que debe aceptar cualquier agente que se registre. Esto significa que cualquier agente podría enviar un trabajo que consuma un espacio excesivo de procesador y disco en los agentes. Por supuesto, dado que Mac OS X es un sistema operativo basado en BSD, el controlador podría emplear métodos UNIX para restringir las conexiones de red de los agentes. Los Daemons XGrid se ejecutan como el usuario nadie, lo que significa que los demonios pueden leer, escribir o ejecutar cualquier archivo de acuerdo con los permisos mundiales. Por lo tanto, los trabajos XGrid pueden ejecutar muchos comandos y escribir a /tmp y /volúmenes. En general, este no es un riesgo de seguridad importante, pero el IS requiere un nivel de confianza entre todos los miembros de la red.3.3 Uso de XGRID 3.3.1 Instalación La instalación y configuración básica de XGrid se describe tanto en la documentación de Apple [5] como en el sitio web de la Universidad de Utah [8]. La instalación es sencilla y no ofrece opciones de personalización. Esto significa que cada computadora en la que se instala XGRID tiene el potencial de ser un cliente, controlador o agente.3.3.2 Configuración del agente y del controlador Los agentes y controladores se pueden configurar a través del panel de preferencia XGRID en las preferencias del sistema o archivos XML en /biblioteca /preferencias. Aquí se inician los procesos GridServer y Gridagent, se establecen las contraseñas y se selecciona el método de descubrimiento del controlador utilizado por los agentes. Por defecto, los agentes usan Rendezvous para encontrar un controlador, aunque los agentes también se pueden configurar para buscar un host específico. El panel de preferencia XGRID también establece si los agentes siempre aceptarán trabajos o solo aceptarán trabajos cuando se inactiva. En términos XGrid, Idle, ya sea que el ahorro de pantalla XGRID se ha activado, o el mouse y el teclado no se han utilizado durante más de 15 minutos. Incluso si el agente está configurado para aceptar siempre tareas, si la computadora se usa, estas tareas se ejecutarán en segundo plano con una prioridad baja. Sin embargo, si un agente solo acepta trabajos cuando está inactivo, cualquier tarea inacabada que se realiza cuando la computadora deja de estar inactiva se detiene de inmediato y se pierden los resultados intermediarios. Luego, el controlador asigna la tarea a otro miembro disponible de la cuadrícula. La publicidad del controlador a través de Rendezvous se puede deshabilitar editando /library/preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist. Esto, sin embargo, no evitará que un agente se conecte al controlador por nombre de host.3.3.3 Enviar trabajos desde un cliente XGRID El cliente envía trabajos al controlador, ya sea a través de la GUI XGRID o la línea de comando. La GUI XGRID envía trabajos a través de pequeñas solicitudes llamadas complementos. Apple proporciona complementos de muestra, pero solo son útiles como pruebas simples o como ejemplos de cómo crear un complemento personalizado. Si queremos emplear XGRID para un trabajo útil, requeriremos un complemento personalizado. James Reynolds detalla la creación de complementos personalizados en el sitio web de la Universidad de Utah Mac OS [8]. XGRID almacena complementos en/biblioteca/xgrid/complementos o ~/biblioteca/xgrid/complementos, dependiendo de si el complemento fue instalado con XGRID o creado por un usuario. El parámetro de complemento Core es el comando, que incluye el ejecutable que los agentes ejecutarán. Otro parámetro importante es el directorio de trabajo. Este directorio contiene archivos necesarios que no están instalados en los agentes o disponibles para ellos a través de una red. El directorio de trabajo siempre se copiará en cada agente, por lo que es mejor mantener este directorio pequeño. Si los archivos están instalados en los agentes o están disponibles en una red, el parámetro de directorio de trabajo no es necesario. La línea de comando permite las opciones disponibles con el complemento GUI, pero puede ser un poco más engorroso. Sin embargo, la línea de comando probablemente será el método de elección para un trabajo serio. Los argumentos de comando deben incluirse en un script a menos que sean muy básicos. Esto puede ser un script de Shell, Perl o Python, siempre y cuando el agente pueda interpretarlo.3.3.4 Ejecutando el trabajo XGRID Cuando se inicia el trabajo XGRID, el comando le dice al controlador cómo dividir el trabajo en tareas para los agentes. Entonces el comando es tarred y se gzip y se envía a cada agente;Si hay un directorio de trabajo, esto también es tarred y gzipped y enviado a los agentes.121 Los agentes extraen estos archivos a /tmp y ejecutan la tarea. Recuerde que, dado que el proceso gridagente se ejecuta como el usuario, nadie, todo lo asociado con el comando debe estar disponible para nadie. Los ejecutables llamados por el comando deben instalarse en los agentes a menos que sean muy simples. Si el ejecutable depende de bibliotecas u otros archivos, puede no funcionar correctamente si se transfiere, incluso si los archivos dependientes se hacen referencia en el directorio de trabajo. Cuando la tarea está completa, los resultados están disponibles para el cliente. En principio, los resultados se envían al cliente, pero si esto realmente sucede depende del comando. Si los resultados no se envían al cliente, estarán en /TMP en cada agente. Cuando esté disponible, una mejor solución es dirigir los resultados a un volumen de red accesible para el cliente.3.4 Limitaciones e idiosincrasias Dado que XGRID solo está en su segunda versión previa, hay algunos bordes y limitaciones aproximadas. Apple reconoce algunas limitaciones [7]. Por ejemplo, el controlador no puede determinar si un agente es confiable y el controlador siempre copia el comando y el directorio de trabajo al agente sin verificar para ver si existen en el agente. Es probable que otras limitaciones sean solo un subproducto de un trabajo inacabado. Ni el cliente ni el controlador pueden especificar qué agentes recibirán las tareas, lo cual es particularmente importante si los agentes contienen una variedad de tipos y velocidades de procesadores y el usuario desea optimizar los cálculos. En este momento, la mejor solución a este problema puede ser dividir las computadoras en múltiples cuadrículas lógicas. Tampoco hay una forma estándar de monitorear el progreso de un trabajo en ejecución en cada agente. La GUI XGRID y la línea de comandos indican qué agentes están trabajando en tareas, pero no dan indicación de progreso. Finalmente, en este momento solo los clientes de Mac OS X pueden enviar trabajos a la red. El marco existe para permitir que terceros escriban complementos para otros sabores UNIX, pero Apple no los ha creado.4. Implementación de XGrid Nuestro objetivo es una granja XGRID para alias Maya. La escuela Ringling tiene alrededor de 400 Apple Power Mac G4 y G5 en 13 laboratorios de computación. Las computadoras varían de 733 MHz de procesador único G4S y 500 MHz y 1 GHz G4S de doble procesador a 1.8 GHz G5S de doble procesador. Todas estas computadoras se usan ligeramente por la noche y los fines de semana y representan un enorme recurso de procesamiento para nuestros proyectos de renderizado para estudiantes.4.1 Instalación de software Durante nuestras pruebas XGRID, cargamos software en cada computadora varias veces, incluidos los sistemas operativos. Ahorramos tiempo facilitando nuestras instalaciones con el software de Daemon de Administración Remota (Radmind) desarrollado en la Universidad de Michigan [9], [10]. Todo lo que instalamos para las pruebas se creó por primera vez como una carga base o sobrecarga de radmind. Por lo tanto, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, XGRID, POV-Ray [11] y Alias Maya se almacenaron en un servidor Radmind y luego se instalaron en nuestras computadoras de prueba cuando sea necesario.4.2 Pruebas iniciales Utilizamos seis 1.8 GHz de doble procesador Apple Power Mac G5S para nuestras pruebas XGRID. Cada computadora ejecutaba Mac OS X 10.3.3 y contenía 1 GB de RAM. Como se muestra en la Figura 1, una computadora sirvió como cliente y controlador, mientras que los otros cinco actuaron como agentes. Antes de intentar la representación maya con XGrid, realizamos cálculos básicos para consolidar nuestra comprensión de XGrid. La documentación de manzanas XGrid es escasa, por lo que encontrar sitios web útiles facilitó nuestro aprendizaje. Primero ejecutamos el complemento MandelBrot Set proporcionado por Apple, que nos permitió probar la funcionalidad básica de nuestra cuadrícula. Luego realizamos la representación de referencia con el POV-Ray de aplicación de código abierto, según lo descrito por Daniel Côté [12] y James Reynolds [8]. Nuestros resultados mostraron que un doble procesador G5 que representa la imagen de rayos POV de referencia tomó 104 minutos. Romper la imagen en tres partes iguales y usar XGRID para enviar las partes a tres agentes requirió 47 minutos. Sin embargo, dos agentes terminaron su representación en 30 minutos, mientras que el tercer agente usó 47 minutos;Todo el render fue tan rápido como el agente más lento. Estos resultados nos dieron dos información importante. Primero, el tiempo de representación mucho más largo para una de las tareas indicó que debemos tener cuidado de cómo dividimos los trabajos en tareas para los agentes. Todas las partes de la representación no tomarán cantidades iguales de tiempo, incluso si el tamaño del píxel es el mismo. En segundo lugar, dado que POV-Ray no puede aprovechar ambos procesadores en un G5, tampoco puede una tarea XGRID que ejecute POV-Ray. Alias Maya no tiene esta limitación.4.3 Renderización con alias Maya 6 Primero instalamos alias Maya 6 para Mac OS X en el cliente/controlador y cada agente. Maya 6 requiere licencias para su uso como solicitud de estación de trabajo. Sin embargo, si solo se usa para representar desde la línea de comando o de un script, no se necesita ninguna licencia. Por lo tanto, creamos una instalación mínima de Maya como una sobrecarga de radmind. La aplicación se instaló en un directorio oculto dentro /aplicaciones. Esto se hizo para que los usuarios normales de las estaciones de trabajo no encontraran e intentaran ejecutar maya, lo que fallaría porque estas instalaciones no tienen licencia para dicho uso. Además, Maya requiere la existencia de un directorio que termina en la ruta /maya. El directorio debe ser legible y redactado por el usuario maya. Para un usuario que ejecuta maya en una estación de trabajo Mac OS X, la ruta generalmente sería ~/Documents/Maya. A menos que se especifique lo contrario, este directorio será la ubicación predeterminada para datos mayas y archivos de salida. Si el directorio no tiene la Figura 1. Red de prueba XGrid. Cliente/ Controlador Agente 1 Agente 2 Agente 3 Agente 4 Agente 5 Trabajos de volumen de red Los datos de datos 122 Existen, Maya intentará crearlo, incluso si el usuario especifica que los datos y los archivos de salida existen en otras ubicaciones. Sin embargo, XGrid se ejecuta como el usuario nadie, lo que no tiene un directorio de inicio. Maya no puede crear el directorio necesario y busca en su lugar /alias /maya. Este directorio tampoco existe, y el usuario nadie tiene derechos suficientes para crearlo. Nuestra solución era crear manualmente /alias /maya y dar al usuario que nadie lee y escriba permisos. También creamos un volumen de red para el almacenamiento de los datos de representación y los marcos renderizados resultantes. Esto evitó enviar los archivos mayas y las texturas asociadas a cada agente como parte de un directorio de trabajo. Tal solución funcionó bien para nosotros porque nuestras computadoras están geográficamente cerca en una LAN;Si una mayor distancia hubiera separado a los agentes del cliente/controlador, especificar un directorio de trabajo puede haber sido una mejor solución. Finalmente, creamos un complemento GUI personalizado para XGRID. El comando de complemento llama a un script Perl con tres argumentos. Dos argumentos especifican los cuadros iniciales y finales del render y el tercer argumento el número de marcos en cada trabajo (que llamamos el tamaño del clúster). El script luego calcula el número total de empleos y los analiza a los agentes. Por ejemplo, si comenzamos en el cuadro 201 y finalizamos en el cuadro 225, con 5 cuadros para cada trabajo, el complemento creará 5 empleos y los enviará a los agentes. Una vez que los trabajos se envían a los agentes, el script ejecuta el comando/usr/sbin/render en cada agente con los parámetros apropiados para el trabajo en particular. Los resultados se envían al volumen de red. Con la configuración descrita, pudimos renderizar con Alias Maya 6 en nuestra cuadrícula de prueba. La velocidad de reproducción no era importante en este momento;Nuestro primer objetivo era implementar la cuadrícula, y en eso tuvimos éxito.4.3.1 Código de pseudo para el script Perl en el complemento XGRID personalizado en esta sección. Resumimos en formato de pseudo código simplificado El script Perl utilizado en nuestro complemento XGRIG.agente_jobs {• Leer marco inicial, marco final y tamaño de clúster de renderizado.• Verifique si el render se puede dividir en un número entero de trabajos en función del tamaño del clúster.• Si no hay un número entero de trabajos, reduzca el tamaño del clúster del último trabajo y establezca su último cuadro en el marco final del renderizado.• Determine el marco de inicio y el marco final para cada trabajo.• Ejecutar el comando render.} 4.4 Lecciones aprendidas La representación con maya de la GUI XGRID no era trivial. La falta de documentación de XGrid y los requisitos de Maya se combinaron en una imagen confusa, donde era difícil decidir la verdadera causa de los problemas que encontramos. Se requirió prueba y error para determinar la mejor manera de configurar nuestra cuadrícula. El primer obstáculo fue crear el directorio /alias /maya con permisos de lectura y escritura para el usuario nadie. El segundo obstáculo fue aprender que obtuvimos el mejor rendimiento al almacenar los datos de representación en un volumen de red. El último gran obstáculo fue recuperar nuestros resultados de los agentes. A diferencia de las pruebas de renderizado de POV-ray, nuestros resultados mayas iniciales nunca fueron devueltos al cliente;En cambio, Maya almacenó los resultados en /TMP en cada agente. Especificar en el complemento dónde enviar los resultados no cambiaría este comportamiento. Decidimos que este era probablemente un problema maya en lugar de un problema de XGrid, y la solución era enviar los resultados al volumen de la red a través del script Perl.5. Los planes futuros mayas en XGrid aún no están listos para ser utilizados por los estudiantes de Ringling School. Para hacer esto, debemos abordar al menos las siguientes preocupaciones.• Continúe nuestras pruebas de renderizado a través de la línea de comando en lugar del complemento GUI. Esto será esencial para el siguiente paso.• Desarrolle una interfaz apropiada para que los usuarios envíen trabajos al controlador XGRID. Esto probablemente será una extensión a la interfaz web de nuestra granja de renderización existente, donde el alumno especifica los parámetros que se colocan en un script que emite el comando Render.• Realizar pruebas de representación maya cronometradas con XGRID. Parte de esto debería comparar los tiempos de representación para Power Mac G4 y G5.6. Conclusión La computación de la cuadrícula continúa avanzando. Recientemente, la industria de TI ha sido testigo de la aparición de numerosos tipos de aplicaciones de cuadrícula contemporánea, además del marco de la red tradicional para las aplicaciones intensivas de cálculo. Por ejemplo, las aplicaciones entre pares como Kazaa se basan en redes de almacenamiento que no comparten la potencia de procesamiento, sino un protocolo elegante para intercambiar archivos entre los sistemas. Aunque en nuestros campus desalentamos a los estudiantes de utilizar aplicaciones entre pares de la música compartido, se puede utilizar el mismo protocolo en aplicaciones como el soporte de decisiones y la minería de datos. El proyecto National Virtual Virtual Colaboratory Grid [13] vinculará a los investigadores de terremotos en todo Estados Unidos con recursos informáticos, lo que les permitirá compartir conjuntos de datos extremadamente grandes, equipos de investigación y trabajar juntos como equipos virtuales a través de Internet. Hay una variedad de nuevos jugadores de cuadrícula en el mundo de TI que amplía el modelo de computación de la red y avanzando la tecnología de la red al siguiente nivel. SAP [14] está pilotando un proyecto a las aplicaciones SAP ERP de la red que habilita la red, Dell [15] se ha asociado con la informática de la plataforma para consolidar los recursos informáticos y proporcionar sistemas habilitados para la red para aplicaciones intensivas de cálculo, Oracle tiene soporte integrado para la computación de la red en sus 10GLanzamiento [16], United Devices [17] ofrece un servicio de alojamiento para la demanda de gridones, y Sun Microsystems continúa su investigación y desarrollo del motor de cuadrícula Suns N1 [18] que combina plataformas de red y agrupación. Simplemente, la computación de la cuadrícula está en marcha. Los beneficios potenciales de la computación de la red son colosales en el aprendizaje de la educación superior, mientras que los costos de implementación son bajos. Hoy en día, sería difícil identificar una aplicación con un retorno de la inversión tan alto como la informática de la red en las divisiones de tecnología de la información en las instituciones de educación superior. Es un error pasar por alto esta tecnología con una recuperación tan alta.123 7.

        "How many licenses will be required?",
        "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
        "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
        "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
        "XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation.",
        "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
        "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
        "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
        "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
        "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
        "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
        "It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator.",
        "The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
        "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
        "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
        "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
        "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
        "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
        "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
        "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
        "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
        "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
        "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
        "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
        "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
        "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
        "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
        "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
        "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
        "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
        "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
        "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
        "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
        "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
        "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
        "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
        "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
        "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
        "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
        "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
        "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
        "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
        "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
        "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
        "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
        "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
        "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
        "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
        "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
        "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
        "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
        "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
        "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
        "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
        "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
        "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
        "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
        "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
        "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
        "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
        "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
        "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
        "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
        "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
        "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
        "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
        "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
        "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
        "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
        "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
        "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
        "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
        "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
        "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
        "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
        "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
        "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
        "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
        "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
        "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
        "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
        "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
        "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
        "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
        "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
        "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
        "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
        "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
        "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
        "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
        "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
        "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
        "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
        "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
        "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
        "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
        "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
        "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
        "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
        "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
        "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
        "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
        "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
        "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
        "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
        "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
        "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
        "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
        "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
        "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
        "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
        "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
        "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
        "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
        "Xgrid test grid.",
        "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
        "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
        "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
        "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
        "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
        "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
        "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
        "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
        "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
        "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
        "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
        "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
        "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
        "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
        "The results are sent to the network volume.",
        "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",
        "Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of render. • Check whether the render can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial.",
        "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
        "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
        "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
        "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
        "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
        "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
        "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
        "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
        "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
        "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
        "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
        "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",
        "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",
        "CONCLUSION Grid computing continues to advance.",
        "Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.",
        "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
        "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",
        "The National Virtual Collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers across the U.S. with computing resources, allowing them to share extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together as virtual teams over the Internet.",
        "There is an assortment of new grid players in the IT world expanding the grid computing model and advancing the grid technology to the next level.",
        "SAP [14] is piloting a project to grid-enable SAP ERP applications, Dell [15] has partnered with Platform Computing to consolidate computing resources and provide grid-enabled systems for compute intensive applications, Oracle has integrated support for grid computing in their 10g release [16], United Devices [17] offers hosting service for gridon-demand, and Sun Microsystems continues their research and development of Suns N1 Grid engine [18] which combines grid and clustering platforms.",
        "Simply, the grid computing is up and coming.",
        "The potential benefits of grid computing are colossal in higher education learning while the implementation costs are low.",
        "Today, it would be difficult to identify an application with as high a return on investment as grid computing in information technology divisions in higher education institutions.",
        "It is a mistake to overlook this technology with such a high payback. 123 7.",
        "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank Scott Hanselman of the IT team at the Ringling School of Art and Design for providing valuable input in the planning of our Xgrid testing.",
        "We would also like to thank the posters of the Xgrid Mailing List [13] for providing insight into many areas of Xgrid. 8.",

                "INTRODUCTION Grid computing does not have a single, universally accepted definition.",
                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",
                "Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.",
                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",
                "There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters.",
                "Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.",
                "In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",
                "Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.",
                "A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer.",
                "Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve.",
                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",

                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",

                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",

                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",

                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",

                "With a student to computer ratio of better than 2-to-1, the Ringling School has achieved national recognition for its large-scale integration of technology into collegiate visual art and <br>design</br> education.",
                "We have found that Mac OS X is the best operating system to train future artists and designers.",
                "Moreover, we can now buy Macs to run high-end graphics, nonlinear video editing, animation, multimedia, web production, and digital video applications rather than expensive UNIX workstations.",
                "As visual artists cross from paint on canvas to creating in the digital realm, the demand for a highperformance computing environment grows.",
                "In our public computer laboratories, students use the computers most often during the workday; at night and on weekends the computers see only light use.",
                "In order to harness the lost processing time for tasks such as video rendering, we are testing Xgrid, a suite of Mac OS X applications recently developed by Apple for parallel and distributed high-performance computing.",
                "As with any new technology deployment, IT managers need to consider a number of factors as they assess, plan, and implement Xgrid.",
                "Therefore, we would like to share valuable information we learned from our implementation of an Xgrid environment with our colleagues.",
                "In our report, we will address issues such as assessing the needs for grid computing, potential applications, management tools, security, authentication, integration into existing infrastructure, application support, user training, and user support.",

                "General Terms Management, Documentation, Performance, <br>design</br>, Economics, Reliability, Experimentation. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Grid computing does not have a single, universally accepted definition.",
                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",
                "Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.",
                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",
                "There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters.",
                "Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.",
                "In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",
                "Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.",
                "A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer.",
                "Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve.",
                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",
                "By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes.",
                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
                "XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation.",
                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
                "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
                "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
                "It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator.",
                "The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",

                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",

                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",
                "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION Grid computing continues to advance.",
                "Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.",
                "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
                "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",
                "The National Virtual Collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers across the U.S. with computing resources, allowing them to share extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together as virtual teams over the Internet.",
                "There is an assortment of new grid players in the IT world expanding the grid computing model and advancing the grid technology to the next level.",
                "SAP [14] is piloting a project to grid-enable SAP ERP applications, Dell [15] has partnered with Platform Computing to consolidate computing resources and provide grid-enabled systems for compute intensive applications, Oracle has integrated support for grid computing in their 10g release [16], United Devices [17] offers hosting service for gridon-demand, and Sun Microsystems continues their research and development of Suns N1 Grid engine [18] which combines grid and clustering platforms.",

                "General Terms Management, Documentation, Performance, Design, Economics, Reliability, Experimentation. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Grid computing does not have a single, universally accepted definition.",
                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",
                "Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.",
                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",
                "There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters.",
                "Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.",
                "In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",
                "Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.",
                "A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer.",
                "Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve.",
                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",
                "By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes.",
                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
                "XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation.",
                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
                "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
                "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
                "It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator.",
                "The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",

                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",

                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",

                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",

                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",
                "By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes.",
                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
                "XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation.",
                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
                "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
                "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
                "It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator.",
                "The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",
                "Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of render. • Check whether the render can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial.",
                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",

                "With a student to computer ratio of better than 2-to-1, the Ringling School has achieved national recognition for its large-scale integration of technology into collegiate visual art and design education.",
                "We have found that <br>mac os x</br> is the best operating system to train future artists and designers.",
                "Moreover, we can now buy Macs to run high-end graphics, nonlinear video editing, animation, multimedia, web production, and digital video applications rather than expensive UNIX workstations.",
                "As visual artists cross from paint on canvas to creating in the digital realm, the demand for a highperformance computing environment grows.",
                "In our public computer laboratories, students use the computers most often during the workday; at night and on weekends the computers see only light use.",
                "In order to harness the lost processing time for tasks such as video rendering, we are testing Xgrid, a suite of <br>mac os x</br> applications recently developed by Apple for parallel and distributed high-performance computing.",
                "As with any new technology deployment, IT managers need to consider a number of factors as they assess, plan, and implement Xgrid.",
                "Therefore, we would like to share valuable information we learned from our implementation of an Xgrid environment with our colleagues.",
                "In our report, we will address issues such as assessing the needs for grid computing, potential applications, management tools, security, authentication, integration into existing infrastructure, application support, user training, and user support.",
                "Furthermore, we will discuss the issues that arose and the lessons learned during and after the implementation process.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication Networks]: Distributed Systemsdistributed applications.",
                "General Terms Management, Documentation, Performance, Design, Economics, Reliability, Experimentation. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Grid computing does not have a single, universally accepted definition.",
                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",
                "Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.",
                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",
                "There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters.",
                "Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.",
                "In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",
                "Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.",
                "A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer.",
                "Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve.",
                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on <br>mac os x</br>.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",
                "By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes.",
                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
                "XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation.",
                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires <br>mac os x</br> 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
                "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
                "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
                "It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator.",
                "The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since <br>mac os x</br> is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only <br>mac os x</br> clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, <br>mac os x</br>, <br>mac os x</br> Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran <br>mac os x</br> 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for <br>mac os x</br> on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a <br>mac os x</br> workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",
                "Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of render. • Check whether the render can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial.",
                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",
                "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION Grid computing continues to advance.",
                "Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.",
                "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
                "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",
                "The National Virtual Collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers across the U.S. with computing resources, allowing them to share extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together as virtual teams over the Internet.",
                "There is an assortment of new grid players in the IT world expanding the grid computing model and advancing the grid technology to the next level.",
                "SAP [14] is piloting a project to grid-enable SAP ERP applications, Dell [15] has partnered with Platform Computing to consolidate computing resources and provide grid-enabled systems for compute intensive applications, Oracle has integrated support for grid computing in their 10g release [16], United Devices [17] offers hosting service for gridon-demand, and Sun Microsystems continues their research and development of Suns N1 Grid engine [18] which combines grid and clustering platforms.",
                "Simply, the grid computing is up and coming.",
                "The potential benefits of grid computing are colossal in higher education learning while the implementation costs are low.",
                "Today, it would be difficult to identify an application with as high a return on investment as grid computing in information technology divisions in higher education institutions.",
                "It is a mistake to overlook this technology with such a high payback. 123 7.",

                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",

                "In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",

                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",

                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",

                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",

                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based <br>operating system</br>, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",

                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",

                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",

                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",

                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",

                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",

                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",

                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",

                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",

                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",

                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",

                "With a student to computer ratio of better than 2-to-1, the Ringling School has achieved national recognition for its large-scale integration of technology into collegiate visual art and design education.",
                "We have found that Mac OS X is the best operating system to train future artists and designers.",
                "Moreover, we can now buy Macs to run high-end graphics, <br>nonlinear video editing</br>, animation, multimedia, web production, and digital video applications rather than expensive UNIX workstations.",
                "As visual artists cross from paint on canvas to creating in the digital realm, the demand for a highperformance computing environment grows.",
                "In our public computer laboratories, students use the computers most often during the workday; at night and on weekends the computers see only light use.",
                "In order to harness the lost processing time for tasks such as video rendering, we are testing Xgrid, a suite of Mac OS X applications recently developed by Apple for parallel and distributed high-performance computing.",
                "As with any new technology deployment, IT managers need to consider a number of factors as they assess, plan, and implement Xgrid.",
                "Therefore, we would like to share valuable information we learned from our implementation of an Xgrid environment with our colleagues.",
                "In our report, we will address issues such as assessing the needs for grid computing, potential applications, management tools, security, authentication, integration into existing infrastructure, application support, user training, and user support.",
                "Furthermore, we will discuss the issues that arose and the lessons learned during and after the implementation process.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication Networks]: Distributed Systemsdistributed applications.",
                "General Terms Management, Documentation, Performance, Design, Economics, Reliability, Experimentation. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Grid computing does not have a single, universally accepted definition.",
                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",
                "Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.",
                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",
                "There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters.",
                "Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.",
                "In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",
                "Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.",
                "A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer.",
                "Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve.",
                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",
                "By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes.",
                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
                "XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation.",
                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
                "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
                "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
                "It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator.",
                "The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",
                "Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of render. • Check whether the render can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial.",
                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",
                "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION Grid computing continues to advance.",
                "Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.",
                "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
                "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",
                "The National Virtual Collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers across the U.S. with computing resources, allowing them to share extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together as virtual teams over the Internet.",
                "There is an assortment of new grid players in the IT world expanding the grid computing model and advancing the grid technology to the next level.",
                "SAP [14] is piloting a project to grid-enable SAP ERP applications, Dell [15] has partnered with Platform Computing to consolidate computing resources and provide grid-enabled systems for compute intensive applications, Oracle has integrated support for grid computing in their 10g release [16], United Devices [17] offers hosting service for gridon-demand, and Sun Microsystems continues their research and development of Suns N1 Grid engine [18] which combines grid and clustering platforms.",
                "Simply, the grid computing is up and coming.",
                "The potential benefits of grid computing are colossal in higher education learning while the implementation costs are low.",
                "Today, it would be difficult to identify an application with as high a return on investment as grid computing in information technology divisions in higher education institutions.",
                "It is a mistake to overlook this technology with such a high payback. 123 7.",
                "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank Scott Hanselman of the IT team at the Ringling School of Art and Design for providing valuable input in the planning of our Xgrid testing.",

                "General Terms Management, Documentation, Performance, Design, Economics, Reliability, Experimentation. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Grid computing does not have a single, universally accepted definition.",
                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",
                "Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.",
                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",
                "There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters.",
                "Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.",
                "In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",
                "Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.",
                "A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer.",
                "Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve.",
                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered <br>animation</br>.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",
                "By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes.",
                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
                "XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation.",
                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
                "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
                "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
                "It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator.",
                "The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",

                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",

                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",
                "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",

                "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
                "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",

                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",
                "Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of render. • Check whether the render can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial.",
                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",
                "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",

                "Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.",
                "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
                "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",

                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",
                "Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.",
                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",
                "There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters.",
                "Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.",
                "In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",
                "Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.",
                "A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer.",
                "Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve.",
                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",
                "By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes.",
                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
                "XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation.",
                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
                "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
                "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
                "It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator.",
                "The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",
                "Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of render. • Check whether the render can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial.",
                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",
                "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION Grid computing continues to advance.",
                "Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.",
                "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
                "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",
                "The National Virtual Collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers across the U.S. with computing resources, allowing them to share extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together as virtual teams over the Internet.",
                "There is an assortment of new grid players in the IT world expanding the grid computing model and advancing the grid technology to the next level.",
                "SAP [14] is piloting a project to grid-enable SAP ERP applications, Dell [15] has partnered with Platform Computing to consolidate computing resources and provide grid-enabled systems for compute intensive applications, Oracle has integrated support for grid computing in their 10g release [16], United Devices [17] offers hosting service for gridon-demand, and Sun Microsystems continues their research and development of Suns N1 Grid engine [18] which combines grid and clustering platforms.",
                "Simply, the grid computing is up and coming.",
                "The potential benefits of grid computing are colossal in higher education learning while the implementation costs are low.",
                "Today, it would be difficult to identify an application with as high a return on investment as grid computing in information technology divisions in higher education institutions.",
                "It is a mistake to overlook this technology with such a high payback. 123 7.",
                "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank Scott Hanselman of the IT team at the Ringling School of Art and Design for providing valuable input in the planning of our Xgrid testing.",

                "General Terms Management, Documentation, Performance, Design, Economics, Reliability, Experimentation. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Grid computing does not have a single, universally accepted definition.",
                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",
                "Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.",
                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",
                "There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters.",
                "Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.",
                "In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",
                "Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.",
                "A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer.",
                "Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve.",
                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",
                "By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes.",
                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
                "XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation.",
                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
                "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
                "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
                "It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator.",
                "The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",
                "Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of render. • Check whether the render can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial.",
                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",
                "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION Grid computing continues to advance.",
                "Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.",
                "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
                "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",
                "The National Virtual Collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers across the U.S. with computing resources, allowing them to share extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together as virtual teams over the Internet.",
                "There is an assortment of new grid players in the IT world expanding the grid computing model and advancing the grid technology to the next level.",
                "SAP [14] is piloting a project to grid-enable SAP ERP applications, Dell [15] has partnered with Platform Computing to consolidate computing resources and provide grid-enabled systems for compute intensive applications, Oracle has integrated support for grid computing in their 10g release [16], United Devices [17] offers hosting service for gridon-demand, and Sun Microsystems continues their research and development of Suns N1 Grid engine [18] which combines grid and clustering platforms.",
                "Simply, the grid computing is up and coming.",

                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",

                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",

                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",

                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",

                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",

                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",

                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",
                "Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of render. • Check whether the render can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial.",
                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",
                "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION Grid computing continues to advance.",
                "Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.",
                "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
                "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",
                "The National Virtual Collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers across the U.S. with computing resources, allowing them to share extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together as virtual teams over the Internet.",

                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",

                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",

                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",

                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",

                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",

                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",

                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",

                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",

                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",

                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",

                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",

                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",

                "With a student to computer ratio of better than 2-to-1, the Ringling School has achieved national recognition for its large-scale integration of technology into collegiate visual art and design education.",
                "We have found that Mac OS X is the best operating system to train future artists and designers.",
                "Moreover, we can now buy Macs to run high-end graphics, nonlinear video editing, animation, multimedia, web production, and digital video applications rather than expensive UNIX workstations.",
                "As visual artists cross from paint on canvas to creating in the digital realm, the demand for a highperformance computing environment grows.",
                "In our public computer laboratories, students use the computers most often during the workday; at night and on weekends the computers see only light use.",
                "In order to harness the lost processing time for tasks such as video rendering, we are testing <br>xgrid</br>, a suite of Mac OS X applications recently developed by Apple for parallel and distributed high-performance computing.",
                "As with any new technology deployment, IT managers need to consider a number of factors as they assess, plan, and implement <br>xgrid</br>.",
                "Therefore, we would like to share valuable information we learned from our implementation of an <br>xgrid</br> environment with our colleagues.",
                "In our report, we will address issues such as assessing the needs for grid computing, potential applications, management tools, security, authentication, integration into existing infrastructure, application support, user training, and user support.",
                "Furthermore, we will discuss the issues that arose and the lessons learned during and after the implementation process.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication Networks]: Distributed Systemsdistributed applications.",
                "General Terms Management, Documentation, Performance, Design, Economics, Reliability, Experimentation. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Grid computing does not have a single, universally accepted definition.",
                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",
                "Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.",
                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",
                "There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters.",
                "Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.",
                "In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",
                "Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.",
                "A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer.",
                "Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve.",
                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples <br>xgrid</br> [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",
                "By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes.",
                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
                "<br>xgrid</br> <br>xgrid</br> is Apples grid implementation.",
                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the <br>xgrid</br> Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "<br>xgrid</br>, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default <br>xgrid</br> automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
                "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
                "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
                "It may be best to view <br>xgrid</br> as a facilitator.",
                "The <br>xgrid</br> architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
                "However, <br>xgrid</br> does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 <br>xgrid</br> Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the <br>xgrid</br> GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In <br>xgrid</br> Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, <br>xgrid</br> requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "<br>xgrid</br> uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The <br>xgrid</br> daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, <br>xgrid</br> jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using <br>xgrid</br> 3.3.1 Installation Basic <br>xgrid</br> installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which <br>xgrid</br> is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the <br>xgrid</br> Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The <br>xgrid</br> Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In <br>xgrid</br> terms, idle either means that the <br>xgrid</br> screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.<br>xgrid</br>controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an <br>xgrid</br> Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the <br>xgrid</br> GUI or the command line.",
                "The <br>xgrid</br> GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ <br>xgrid</br> for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "<br>xgrid</br> stores plug-ins in /Library/<br>xgrid</br>/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the <br>xgrid</br> Job When the <br>xgrid</br> job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since <br>xgrid</br> is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The <br>xgrid</br> GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "<br>xgrid</br> IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an <br>xgrid</br> render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our <br>xgrid</br> testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, <br>xgrid</br>, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our <br>xgrid</br> tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with <br>xgrid</br>, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of <br>xgrid</br>.",
                "Apples <br>xgrid</br> documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using <br>xgrid</br> to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an <br>xgrid</br> task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",

                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for <br>xgrid</br>.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",

                "The lack of <br>xgrid</br> documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an <br>xgrid</br> issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on <br>xgrid</br> is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the <br>xgrid</br> controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with <br>xgrid</br>.",
                "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",

                "Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.",
                "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
                "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",
                "The National Virtual Collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers across the U.S. with computing resources, allowing them to share extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together as virtual teams over the Internet.",
                "There is an assortment of new grid players in the IT world expanding the grid computing model and advancing the grid technology to the next level.",
                "SAP [14] is piloting a project to grid-enable SAP ERP applications, Dell [15] has partnered with Platform Computing to consolidate computing resources and provide grid-enabled systems for compute intensive applications, Oracle has integrated support for grid computing in their 10g release [16], United Devices [17] offers hosting service for gridon-demand, and Sun Microsystems continues their research and development of Suns N1 Grid engine [18] which combines grid and clustering platforms.",
                "Simply, the grid computing is up and coming.",

                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",
                "Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of render. • Check whether the render can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial.",
                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",
                "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",

                "We have found that Mac OS X is the best operating system to train future artists and designers.",
                "Moreover, we can now buy Macs to run high-end graphics, nonlinear video editing, animation, multimedia, web production, and digital video applications rather than expensive UNIX workstations.",
                "As visual artists cross from paint on canvas to creating in the digital realm, the demand for a highperformance computing environment grows.",
                "In our public computer laboratories, students use the computers most often during the workday; at night and on weekends the computers see only light use.",
                "In order to harness the lost processing time for tasks such as video rendering, we are testing Xgrid, a suite of Mac OS X applications recently developed by Apple for parallel and distributed high-performance computing.",
                "As with any new technology deployment, IT managers need to consider a number of factors as they assess, plan, and implement Xgrid.",
                "Therefore, we would like to share valuable information we learned from our implementation of an Xgrid environment with our colleagues.",
                "In our report, we will address issues such as assessing the needs for grid computing, potential applications, management tools, security, authentication, integration into existing infrastructure, application support, user training, and user support.",
                "Furthermore, we will discuss the issues that arose and the lessons learned during and after the implementation process.",

                "General Terms Management, Documentation, Performance, Design, Economics, Reliability, Experimentation. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Grid computing does not have a single, universally accepted definition.",
                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",
                "Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.",
                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A <br>cluster</br> is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The <br>cluster</br> appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",
                "There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters.",
                "Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.",
                "In a high-availability <br>cluster</br>, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",
                "Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.",
                "A parallel <br>cluster</br> is a type of supercomputer.",
                "Problems are split into many parts, and individual <br>cluster</br> members are given part of the problem to solve.",
                "An example of a parallel <br>cluster</br> is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and <br>cluster</br> A computer grid expands the capabilities of the <br>cluster</br> by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",
                "By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes.",
                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
                "XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation.",
                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
                "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
                "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
                "It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator.",
                "The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called <br>cluster</br> mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the <br>cluster</br> size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",

                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",

                "Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.",
                "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
                "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",

                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",

                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",

                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",

                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",

                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",

                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",

                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",
                "Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of render. • Check whether the render can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial.",
                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",

                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",

                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",

                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",

                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",

                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",

                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use <br>rendezvous</br> to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via <br>rendezvous</br> can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid render farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire render was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",
                "Second, since POV-Ray cannot take advantage of both processors in a G5, neither can an Xgrid task running POV-Ray.",
                "Alias Maya does not have this limitation. 4.3 Rendering with Alias Maya 6 We first installed Alias Maya 6 for Mac OS X on the client/controller and each agent.",
                "Maya 6 requires licenses for use as a workstation application.",
                "However, if it is just used for rendering from the command line or a script, no license is needed.",
                "We thus created a minimal installation of Maya as a radmind overload.",
                "The application was installed in a hidden directory inside /Applications.",
                "This was done so that normal users of the workstations would not find and attempt to run Maya, which would fail because these installations are not licensed for such use.",
                "In addition, Maya requires the existence of a directory ending in the path /maya.",
                "The directory must be readable and writable by the Maya user.",
                "For a user running Maya on a Mac OS X workstation, the path would usually be ~/Documents/maya.",
                "Unless otherwise specified, this directory will be the default location for Maya data and output files.",
                "If the directory does not Figure 1.",
                "Xgrid test grid.",
                "Client/ Controller Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 Agent 4 Agent 5 Network Volume Jobs Data Data 122 exist, Maya will try to create it, even if the user specifies that the data and output files exist in other locations.",
                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the render and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/Render command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to render with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",

                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing render farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the Render command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",

                "Moreover, we can now buy Macs to run high-end graphics, nonlinear video editing, animation, multimedia, web production, and digital video applications rather than expensive UNIX workstations.",
                "As visual artists cross from paint on canvas to creating in the digital realm, the demand for a highperformance computing environment grows.",
                "In our public computer laboratories, students use the computers most often during the workday; at night and on weekends the computers see only light use.",
                "In order to harness the lost processing time for tasks such as video rendering, we are testing Xgrid, a suite of Mac OS X applications recently developed by Apple for parallel and distributed high-performance computing.",

                "General Terms Management, Documentation, Performance, Design, Economics, Reliability, Experimentation. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Grid computing does not have a single, universally accepted definition.",
                "The technology behind grid computing model is not new.",
                "Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.",
                "Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.",
                "Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of utility computing.",
                "Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective. 1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.",
                "The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.",
                "In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.",
                "There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and highavailability clusters.",
                "Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.",
                "In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.",
                "If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.",
                "For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.",
                "Should one web server die, another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.",
                "A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer.",
                "Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve.",
                "An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1]. 1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.",
                "The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.",
                "A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.",
                "Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc. 1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.",
                "A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.",
                "The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer. 1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.",
                "In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.",
                "The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.",
                "In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.",
                "The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.",
                "A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data. 1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.",
                "A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.",
                "The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.",
                "In addition, the machines on the grid can be generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 2.",
                "ASSESSING THE NEED FOR GRID COMPUTING Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks.",
                "The results of each task cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel.",
                "Once the tasks have been completed, the results can be assembled into the solution.",
                "Examples of parallelizable computations are the Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames of a rendered animation.",
                "This paper is concerned with the last example. 2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then return results.",
                "In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.",
                "Applications heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment than on a grid platform.",
                "Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.",
                "Our interest is in using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apples Xgrid [4] on Mac OS X.",
                "Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.",
                "This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.",
                "By its nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle computers changes.",
                "How many licenses will be required?",
                "Our resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section. 2.2 Integration into the Existing Infrastructure The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members are available, and parses out job to available members.",
                "The controller must be able to see members on the network.",
                "This does not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller, but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be configured to allow grid traffic. 3.",
                "XGRID Xgrid is Apples grid implementation.",
                "It was inspired by Zilla, a desktop clustering application developed by NeXT and acquired by Apple.",
                "In this report we describe the Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a free download that requires Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later and a minimum 128 MB RAM [5].",
                "Xgrid, leverages Apples traditional ease of use and configuration.",
                "If the grid members are on the same subnet, by default Xgrid automatically discovers available resources through Rendezvous [6].",
                "Tasks are submitted to the grid through a GUI interface or by the command line.",
                "A System Preference Pane controls when each computer is available to the grid.",
                "It may be best to view Xgrid as a facilitator.",
                "The Xgrid architecture handles software and data distribution, job execution, and result aggregation.",
                "However, Xgrid does not perform the actual calculations. 3.1 Xgrid Components Xgrid has three major components: the client, controller, and the agent.",
                "Each component is included in the default installation, and any computer can easily be configured to assume any role.",
                "In 120 fact, for testing purposes, a computer can simultaneously assume all roles in local mode.",
                "The more typical production use is called cluster mode.",
                "The client submits jobs to the controller through the Xgrid GUI or command line.",
                "The client defines how the job will be broken into tasks for the grid.",
                "If any files or executables must be sent as part of a job, they must reside on the client or at a location accessible to the client.",
                "When a job is complete, the client can retrieve the results from the controller.",
                "A client can only connect to a single controller at a time.",
                "The controller runs the GridServer process.",
                "It queues tasks received from clients, distributes those tasks to the agents, and handles failover if an agent cannot complete a task.",
                "In Xgrid Technology Preview 2, a controller can handle a maximum of 10,000 agent connections.",
                "Only one controller can exist per logical grid.",
                "The agents run the GridAgent process.",
                "When the GridAgent process starts, it registers with a controller; an agent can only be connected to one controller at a time.",
                "Agents receive tasks from their controller, perform the specified computations, and then send the results back to the controller.",
                "An agent can be configured to always accept tasks, or to just accept them when the computer is not otherwise busy. 3.2 Security and Authentication By default, Xgrid requires two passwords.",
                "First, a client needs a password to access a controller.",
                "Second, the controller needs a password to access an agent.",
                "Either password requirement can be disabled.",
                "Xgrid uses two-way-random mutual authentication protocol with MD5 hashes.",
                "At this time, data encryption is only used for passwords.",
                "As mentioned earlier, an agent registers with a controller when the GridAgent process starts.",
                "There is no native method for the controller to reject agents, and so it must accept any agent that registers.",
                "This means that any agent could submit a job that consumes excessive processor and disk space on the agents.",
                "Of course, since Mac OS X is a BSD-based operating system, the controller could employ Unix methods of restricting network connections from agents.",
                "The Xgrid daemons run as the user nobody, which means the daemons can read, write, or execute any file according to world permissions.",
                "Thus, Xgrid jobs can execute many commands and write to /tmp and /Volumes.",
                "In general, this is not a major security risk, but is does require a level of trust between all members of the grid. 3.3 Using Xgrid 3.3.1 Installation Basic Xgrid installation and configuration is described both in Apple documentation [5] and online at the University of Utah web site [8].",
                "The installation is straightforward and offers no options for customization.",
                "This means that every computer on which Xgrid is installed has the potential to be a client, controller, or agent. 3.3.2 Agent and Controller Configuration The agents and controllers can be configured through the Xgrid Preference Pane in the System Preferences or XML files in /Library/Preferences.",
                "Here the GridServer and GridAgent processes are started, passwords set, and the controller discovery method used by agents is selected.",
                "By default, agents use Rendezvous to find a controller, although the agents can also be configured to look for a specific host.",
                "The Xgrid Preference Pane also sets whether the Agents will always accept jobs, or only accept jobs when idle.",
                "In Xgrid terms, idle either means that the Xgrid screen saver has activated, or the mouse and keyboard have not been used for more than 15 minutes.",
                "Even if the agent is configured to always accept tasks, if the computer is being used these tasks will run in the background at a low priority.",
                "However, if an agent only accepts jobs when idle, any unfinished task being performed when the computer ceases being idle are immediately stopped and any intermediary results lost.",
                "Then the controller assigns the task to another available member of the grid.",
                "Advertising the controller via Rendezvous can be disabled by editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.controller.plist.",
                "This, however, will not prevent an agent from connecting to the controller by hostname. 3.3.3 Sending Jobs from an Xgrid Client The client sends jobs to the controller either through the Xgrid GUI or the command line.",
                "The Xgrid GUI submits jobs via small applications called plug-ins.",
                "Sample plug-ins are provided by Apple, but they are only useful as simple testing or as examples of how to create a custom plug-in.",
                "If we are to employ Xgrid for useful work, we will require a custom plug-in.",
                "James Reynolds details the creation of custom plug-ins on the University of Utah Mac OS web site [8].",
                "Xgrid stores plug-ins in /Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins or ~/Library/Xgrid/Plug-ins, depending on whether the plug-in was installed with Xgrid or created by a user.",
                "The core plug-in parameter is the command, which includes the executable the agents will run.",
                "Another important parameter is the working directory.",
                "This directory contains necessary files that are not installed on the agents or available to them over a network.",
                "The working directory will always be copied to each agent, so it is best to keep this directory small.",
                "If the files are installed on the agents or available over a network, the working directory parameter is not needed.",
                "The command line allows the options available with the GUI plug-in, but it can be slightly more cumbersome.",
                "However, the command line probably will be the method of choice for serious work.",
                "The command arguments must be included in a script unless they are very basic.",
                "This can be a shell, perl, or python script, as long as the agent can interpret it. 3.3.4 Running the Xgrid Job When the Xgrid job is started, the command tells the controller how to break the job into tasks for the agents.",
                "Then the command is tarred and gzipped and sent to each agent; if there is a working directory, this is also tarred and gzipped and sent to the agents. 121 The agents extract these files into /tmp and run the task.",
                "Recall that since the GridAgent process runs as the user nobody, everything associated with the command must be available to nobody.",
                "Executables called by the command should be installed on the agents unless they are very simple.",
                "If the executable depends on libraries or other files, it may not function properly if transferred, even if the dependent files are referenced in the working directory.",
                "When the task is complete, the results are available to the client.",
                "In principle, the results are sent to the client, but whether this actually happens depends on the command.",
                "If the results are not sent to the client, they will be in /tmp on each agent.",
                "When available, a better solution is to direct the results to a network volume accessible to the client. 3.4 Limitations and Idiosyncrasies Since Xgrid is only in its second preview release, there are some rough edges and limitations.",
                "Apple acknowledges some limitations [7].",
                "For example, the controller cannot determine whether an agent is trustworthy and the controller always copies the command and working directory to the agent without checking to see if these exist on the agent.",
                "Other limitations are likely just a by-product of an unfinished work.",
                "Neither the client nor controller can specify which agents will receive the tasks, which is particularly important if the agents contain a variety of processor types and speeds and the user wants to optimize the calculations.",
                "At this time, the best solution to this problem may be to divide the computers into multiple logical grids.",
                "There is also no standard way to monitor the progress of a running job on each agent.",
                "The Xgrid GUI and command line indicate which agents are working on tasks, but gives no indication of progress.",
                "Finally, at this time only Mac OS X clients can submit jobs to the grid.",
                "The framework exists to allow third parties to write plug-ins for other Unix flavors, but Apple has not created them. 4.",
                "XGRID IMPLEMENTATION Our goal is an Xgrid <br>render</br> farm for Alias Maya.",
                "The Ringling School has about 400 Apple Power Mac G4s and G5s in 13 computer labs.",
                "The computers range from 733 MHz singleprocessor G4s and 500 MHz and 1 GHz dual-processor G4s to 1.8 GHz dual-processor G5s.",
                "All of these computers are lightly used in the evening and on weekends and represent an enormous processing resource for our student rendering projects. 4.1 Software Installation During our Xgrid testing, we loaded software on each computer multiple times, including the operating systems.",
                "We saved time by facilitating our installations with the remote administration daemon (radmind) software developed at the University of Michigan [9], [10].",
                "Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.",
                "Thus, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Developer Tools, Xgrid, POV-Ray [11], and Alias Maya were stored on a radmind server and then installed on our test computers when needed. 4.2 Initial Testing We used six 1.8 GHz dual-processor Apple Power Mac G5s for our Xgrid tests.",
                "Each computer ran Mac OS X 10.3.3 and contained 1 GB RAM.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, one computer served as both client and controller, while the other five acted as agents.",
                "Before attempting Maya rendering with Xgrid, we performed basic calculations to cement our understanding of Xgrid.",
                "Apples Xgrid documentation is sparse, so finding helpful web sites facilitated our learning.",
                "We first ran the Mandelbrot set plug-in provided by Apple, which allowed us to test the basic functionality of our grid.",
                "Then we performed benchmark rendering with the Open Source Application POV-Ray, as described by Daniel Côté [12] and James Reynolds [8].",
                "Our results showed that one dual-processor G5 rendering the benchmark POV-Ray image took 104 minutes.",
                "Breaking the image into three equal parts and using Xgrid to send the parts to three agents required 47 minutes.",
                "However, two agents finished their rendering in 30 minutes, while the third agent used 47 minutes; the entire <br>render</br> was only as fast as the slowest agent.",
                "These results gave us two important pieces of information.",
                "First, the much longer rendering time for one of the tasks indicated that we should be careful how we split jobs into tasks for the agents.",
                "All portions of the rendering will not take equal amounts of time, even if the pixel size is the same.",

                "However, Xgrid runs as the user nobody, which does not have a home directory.",
                "Maya is unable to create the needed directory, and looks instead for /Alias/maya.",
                "This directory also does not exist, and the user nobody has insufficient rights to create it.",
                "Our solution was to manually create /Alias/maya and give the user nobody read and write permissions.",
                "We also created a network volume for storage of both the rendering data and the resulting rendered frames.",
                "This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.",
                "Such a solution worked well for us because our computers are geographically close on a LAN; if greater distance had separated the agents from the client/controller, specifying a working directory may have been a better solution.",
                "Finally, we created a custom GUI plug-in for Xgrid.",
                "The plug-in command calls a Perl script with three arguments.",
                "Two arguments specify the beginning and end frames of the <br>render</br> and the third argument the number of frames in each job (which we call the cluster size).",
                "The script then calculates the total number of jobs and parses them out to the agents.",
                "For example, if we begin at frame 201 and end at frame 225, with 5 frames for each job, the plug-in will create 5 jobs and send them out to the agents.",
                "Once the jobs are sent to the agents, the script executes the /usr/sbin/<br>render</br> command on each agent with the parameters appropriate for the particular job.",
                "The results are sent to the network volume.",
                "With the setup described, we were able to <br>render</br> with Alias Maya 6 on our test grid.",
                "Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded. 4.3.1 Pseudo Code for Perl Script in Custom Xgrid Plug-in In this section we summarize in simplified pseudo code format the Perl script used in our Xgrig plug-in. agent_jobs{ • Read beginning frame, end frame, and cluster size of <br>render</br>. • Check whether the <br>render</br> can be divided into an integer number of jobs based on the cluster size. • If there are not an integer number of jobs, reduce the cluster size of the last job and set its last frame to the end frame of the render. • Determine the start frame and end frame for each job. • Execute the Render command. } 4.4 Lessons Learned Rendering with Maya from the Xgrid GUI was not trivial.",
                "The lack of Xgrid documentation and the requirements of Maya combined into a confusing picture, where it was difficult to decide the true cause of the problems we encountered.",
                "Trial and error was required to determine the best way to set up our grid.",
                "The first hurdle was creating the directory /Alias/maya with read and write permissions for the user nobody.",
                "The second hurdle was learning that we got the best performance by storing the rendering data on a network volume.",
                "The last major hurdle was retrieving our results from the agents.",
                "Unlike the POV-Ray rendering tests, our initial Maya results were never returned to the client; instead, Maya stored the results in /tmp on each agent.",
                "Specifying in the plug-in where to send the results would not change this behavior.",
                "We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 5.",
                "FUTURE PLANS Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of Ringling School.",
                "In order to do this, we must address at least the following concerns. • Continue our rendering tests through the command line rather than the GUI plug-in.",
                "This will be essential for the following step. • Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the Xgrid controller.",
                "This will probably be an extension to the web interface of our existing <br>render</br> farm, where the student specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the <br>render</br> command. • Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid.",
                "Part of this should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4s and G5s. 6.",

                "Recently, the IT industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.",
                "For instance, peer-to-peer applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.",
                "Although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.",
                "The National Virtual Collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers across the U.S. with computing resources, allowing them to share extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together as virtual teams over the Internet.",
