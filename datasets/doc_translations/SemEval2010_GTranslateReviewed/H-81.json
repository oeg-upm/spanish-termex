The evaluation presented in this paper aims at showing that the distance measures suggested by the MPEG-7 group for the visual descriptors can be beaten by general-purpose measures. Eight visual MPEG-7 descriptors were selected and 38 distance measures implemented. Three media collections were created and assessed, performance indicators developed and more than 22500 tests performed. Additionally, a quantisation model was developed to be able to use predicate-based distance measures on continuous data as well. The evaluation shows that the distance measures recommended in the MPEG-7-standard are among the best but that other measures perform even better.

Each descriptor consists of a feature extraction mechanism, a description (in binary and XML format) and guidelines that define how to apply the descriptor on different kinds of media (e.g. on temporal media). The MPEG-7 descriptors have been carefully designed to meet - partially complementaryrequirements of different application domains: archival, browsing, retrieval, etc. [9]. In the following, we will exclusively deal with the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval. The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors. For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions. Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance. Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific. However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor. These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures. In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects. From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets. The hypothesis is that analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance measure for a specific feature extraction method. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 gives a minimum of background information on the MPEG-7 descriptors and distance measurement in visual information retrieval (VIR, see [3], [16]). Section 3 gives an overview over the implemented distance measures. Section 4 describes the test setup, including the test data and the implemented evaluation methods. Finally, Section 5 presents the results per descriptor and over all descriptors. 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors. Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media. Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation. The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity. Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction). Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined). Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects. These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels. But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information. Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception. Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity). The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance. Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors. The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors. Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example). The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects). Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance. Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object. At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity. If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object. Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement. Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object. If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible. Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g. Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms). Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity). To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g. Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception. In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3. DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1). Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions. Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc. Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly. Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]). Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information. Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas. Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative. Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval. The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas. Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data. The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data. The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13]. They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators. Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure). The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions. In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable. The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation. It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure. Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well. Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure. Generally, binary properties of two objects (e.g. media objects) can exist in both objects (denoted as a), in just one (b, c) or in none of them (d). The operator needed for these relationships are UNION, MINUS and NOT. In the quantisation model they are replaced as follows (see [5] for further details). 131 ∑     ≤ + − + ==∩= k jkikjkik kkji else xx Mif xx ssXXa 0 22, 1ε ( ) ( ) ∑ ∑ ∑     ≤ ++ −==¬∩¬=    ≤−−− ==−=    ≤−−− ==−= k jkikjkik kkji k ikjkikjk kkij k jkikjkik kkji else xx if xx MssXXd else xxMifxx ssXXc else xxMifxx ssXXb 0 22, 0 , 0 , 1 2 2 ε ε ε with: ( ) [ ] ( ) { }0\\ . 0 1 . 0 1 , 2 2 1 minmax maxmin + ∈ − =     ≥      − = =     ≥      − = −= ∈= ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ Rp ki x where else pif p M ki x where else pif p M xxM xxxwithxX i k ik i k ik ikiki µ σ σ σ ε µ µ µ ε a selects properties that are present in both data vectors (Xi, Xj representing media objects), b and c select properties that are present in just one of them and d selects properties that are present in neither of the two data vectors. Every property is selected by the extent to which it is present (a and d: mean, b and c: difference) and only if the amount to which it is present exceeds a certain threshold (depending on the mean and standard deviation over all elements of descriptor space). The implementation of these operators is based on one assumption. It is assumed that vector elements measure on interval scale. That means, each element expresses that the measured property is more or less present (0: not at all, M: fully present). This is true for most visual descriptors and all MPEG-7 descriptors. A natural origin as it is assumed here (0) is not needed. Introducing p (called discriminance-defining parameter) for the thresholds 21 ,εε has the positive consequence that a, b, c, d can then be controlled through a single parameter. p is an additional criterion for the behaviour of a distance measure and determines the thresholds used in the operators. It expresses how accurate data items are present (quantisation) and consequently, how accurate they should be investigated. p can be set by the user or automatically. Interesting are the limits: 1. Mp →⇒∞→ 21 ,εε In this case, all elements (=properties) are assumed to be continuous (high quantisation). In consequence, all properties of a descriptor are used by the operators. Then, the distance measure is not discriminant for properties. 2. 0,0 21 →⇒→ εεp In this case, all properties are assumed to be predicates. In consequence, only binary elements (=predicates) are used by the operators (1-bit quantisation). The distance measure is then highly discriminant for properties. Between these limits, a distance measure that uses the quantisation model is - depending on p - more or less discriminant for properties. This means, it selects a subset of all available description vector elements for distance measurement. For both predicate data and quantitative data it can be shown that the quantisation model is reasonable. If description vectors consist of binary elements only, p should be used as follows (for example, p can easily be set automatically): ( )σµεε ,min..,0,0 21 ==⇒→ pgep In this case, a, b, c, d measure like the set operators they replace. For example, Table 1 shows their behaviour for two onedimensional feature vectors Xi and Xj. As can be seen, the statistical measures work like set operators. Actually, the quantisation model works accurate on predicate data for any p≠∞. To show that the model is reasonable for quantitative data the following fact is used. It is easy to show that for predicate data some quantitative distance measures degenerate to predicatebased measures. For example, the L1 metric (Manhattan metric) degenerates to the Hamming distance (from [9], without weights): distanceHammingcbxxL k jkik =+≡−= ∑1 If it can be shown that the quantisation model is able to reconstruct the quantitative measure from the degenerated predicate-based measure, the model is obviously able to extend predicate-based measures to the quantitative domain. This is easy to illustrate. For purely quantitative feature vectors, p should be used as follows (again, p can easily be set automatically): 1, 21 =⇒∞→ εεp Then, a and d become continuous functions: ∑ ∑ + −==⇒≡≤ + + ==⇒≡≤ + − k jkik kk jkik k jkik kk jkik xx MswheresdtrueM xx xx swheresatrueM xx M 22 22 b and c can be made continuous for the following expressions: ( ) ( ) ∑ ∑ ∑ −==+⇒    ≥−− ==⇒ ≥−≡≤−−    ≥−− ==⇒ ≥−≡≤−− k jkikkk k ikjkikjk kk ikjkikjk k jkikjkik kk jkikjkik xxswherescb else xxifxx swheresc xxMxxM else xxifxx swheresb xxMxxM 0 0 0 0 0 0 Table 1.

For example, the Hamming distance (again, without weights): 1 Lxxxxswherescb k jkik k jkikkk =−=−==+ ∑∑ The quantisation model successfully reconstructs the L1 metric and no distance measure-specific modification has to be made to the model. This demonstrates that the model is reasonable. In the following it will be used to extend successful predicate-based distance measures on the quantitative domain. The major advantages of the quantisation model are: (1) it is application domain independent, (2) the implementation is straightforward, (3) the model is easy to use and finally, (4) the new parameter p allows to control the similarity measurement process in a new way (discriminance on property level). 3.3 Implemented measures For the evaluation described in this work next to predicate-based (based on the quantisation model) and quantitative measures, the distance measures recommended in the MPEG-7 standard were implemented (all together 38 different distance measures). Table 2 summarises those predicate-based measures that performed best in the evaluation (in sum 20 predicate-based measures were investigated). For these measures, K is the number of predicates in the data vectors Xi and Xj. In P1, the sum is used for Tverskys f() (as Tversky himself does in [17]) and α, β are weights for element b and c. In [5] the authors investigated Tverskys Feature Contrast Model and found α=1, β=0 to be the optimum parameters. Some of the predicate-based measures are very simple (e.g. P2, P4) but have been heavily exploited in psychological research. Pattern difference (P6) - a very powerful measure - is used in the statistics package SPSS for cluster analysis. P7 is a correlation coefficient for predicates developed by Pearson. Table 3 shows the best quantitative distance measures that were used. Q1 and Q2 are metric-based and were implemented as representatives for the entire group of Minkowski distances. The wi are weights. In Q5, ii σµ , are mean and standard deviation for the elements of descriptor Xi. In Q6, m is 2 M (=0.5). Q3, the Canberra metric, is a normalised form of Q1. Similarly, Q4, Clarks divergence coefficient is a normalised version of Q2. Q6 is a further-developed correlation coefficient that is invariant against sign changes. This measure is used even though its particular properties are of minor importance for this application domain. Finally, Q8 is a measure that takes the differences between adjacent vector elements into account. This makes it structurally different from all other measures. Obviously, one important distance measure is missing. The Mahalanobis distance was not considered, because different descriptors would require different covariance matrices and for some descriptors it is simply impossible to define a covariance matrix. If the identity matrix was used in this case, the Mahalanobis distance would degenerate to a Minkowski distance. Additionally, the recommended MPEG-7 distances were implemented with the following parameters: In the distance measure of the Color Layout descriptor all weights were set to 1 (as in all other implemented measures). In the distance measure of the Dominant Color descriptor the following parameters were used: 20,1,3.0,7.0 21 ==== dTww α (as recommended). In the Homogeneous Texture descriptors distance all ( )kα were set to 1 and matching was done rotation- and scale-invariant. Important! Some of the measures presented in this section are distance measures while others are similarity measures. For the tests, it is important to notice, that all similarity measures were inverted to distance measures. 4. TEST SETUP Subsection 4.1 describes the descriptors (including parameters) and the collections (including ground truth information) that were used in the evaluation. Subsection 4.2 discusses the evaluation method that was implemented and Subsection 4.3 sketches the test environment used for the evaluation process. 4.1 Test data For the evaluation eight MPEG-7 descriptors were used. All colour descriptors: Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, all texture descriptors: Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing and one shape descriptor: Region-based Shape. Texture Browsing was used even though the MPEG-7 standard suggests that it is not suitable for retrieval. The other basic shape descriptor, Contour-based Shape, was not used, because it produces structurally different descriptions that cannot be transformed to data vectors with elements measuring on interval-scales. The motion descriptors were not used, because they integrate the temporal dimension of visual media and would only be comparable, if the basic colour, texture and shape descriptors would be aggregated over time. This was not done. Finally, no high-level descriptors were used (Localisation, Face Recognition, etc., see Subsection 2.1), because - to the authors opinion - the behaviour of the basic descriptors on elementary media objects should be evaluated before conclusions on aggregated structures can be drawn.

A Manhattan metric was used to measure proximity (see [6] for details). Descriptor extraction was performed using the MPEG-7 reference implementation. In the extraction process each descriptor was applied on the entire content of each media object and the following extraction parameters were used. Colour in Color Structure was quantised to 32 bins. For Dominant Color colour space was set to YCrCb, 5-bit default quantisation was used and the default value for spatial coherency was used. Homogeneous Texture was quantised to 32 components. Scalable Color values were quantised to sizeof(int)-3 bits and 64 bins were used. Finally, Texture Browsing was used with five components. These descriptors were applied on three media collections with image content: the Brodatz dataset (112 images, 512x512 pixel), a subset of the Corel dataset (260 images, 460x300 pixel, portrait and landscape) and a dataset with coats-of-arms images (426 images, 200x200 pixel). Figure 1 shows examples from the three collections. Designing appropriate test sets for a visual evaluation is a highly difficult task (for example, see the TREC video 2002 report [15]). Of course, for identifying the best distance measure for a descriptor, it should be tested on an infinite number of media objects. But this is not the aim of this study. It is just evaluated if - for likely image collections - better proximity measures than those suggested by the MPEG-7 group can be found. Collections of this relatively small size were used in the evaluation, because the applied evaluation methods are above a certain minimum size invariant against collection size and for smaller collections it is easier to define a high-quality ground truth. Still, the average ratio of ground truth size to collection size is at least 1:7. Especially, no collection from the MPEG-7 dataset was used in the evaluation because the evaluations should show, how well the descriptors and the recommended distance measures perform on unknown material. When the descriptor extraction was finished, the resulting XML descriptions were transformed into a data matrix with 798 lines (media objects) and 314 columns (descriptor elements). To be usable with distance measures that do not integrate domain knowledge, the elements of this data matrix were normalised to [0, 1]. For the distance evaluation - next to the normalised data matrixhuman similarity judgement is needed. In this work, the ground truth is built of twelve groups of similar images (four for each dataset). Group membership was rated by humans based on semantic criterions. Table 4 summarises the twelve groups and the underlying descriptions. It has to be noticed, that some of these groups (especially 5, 7 and 10) are much harder to find with lowlevel descriptors than others. 4.2 Evaluation method Usually, retrieval evaluation is performed based on a ground truth with recall and precision (see, for example, [3], [16]). In multidescriptor environments this leads to a problem, because the resulting recall and precision values are strongly influenced by the method used to merge the distance values for one media object. Even though it is nearly impossible to say, how big the influence of a single distance measure was on the resulting recall and precision values, this problem has been almost ignored so far. In Subsection 2.2 it was stated that the major task of a distance measure is to bring the relevant media objects as close to the origin (where the query object lies) as possible. Even in a multidescriptor environment it is then simple to identify the similar objects in a large distance space. Consequently, it was decided to Table 3. Quantitative distance measures.

Identifying clusters of similar objects (based on the given ground truth) is relatively easy, because the resulting distance space for one descriptor and any distance measure is always one-dimensional. Clusters are found by searching from the origin of distance space to the first similar object, grouping all following similar objects in the cluster, breaking off the cluster with the first un-similar object and so forth. For the evaluation two indicators were defined. The first measures the average distance of all cluster means to the origin: distanceavgclustersno sizecluster distanceclustersno i i sizecluster j ij d i _._ _ _ _ ∑ ∑ =µ where distanceij is the distance value of the j-th element in the i-th cluster, ∑ ∑ ∑ = CLUSTERS i i CLUSTERS i sizecluster j ij sizecluster distance distanceavg i _ _ _ , no_clusters is the number of found clusters and cluster_sizei is the size of the i-th cluster. The resulting indicator is normalised by the distribution characteristics of the distance measure (avg_distance). Additionally, the standard deviation is used. In the evaluation process this measure turned out to produce valuable results and to be relatively robust against parameter p of the quantisation model. In Subsection 3.2 we noted that p affects the discriminance of a predicate-based distance measure: The smaller p is set the larger are the resulting clusters because the quantisation model is then more discriminant against properties and less elements of the data matrix are used. This causes a side-effect that is measured by the second indicator: more and more un-similar objects come out with exactly the same distance value as similar objects (a problem that does not exist for large ps) and become indiscernible from similar objects. Consequently, they are (false) cluster members. This phenomenon (conceptually similar to the false negatives indicator) was named cluster pollution and the indicator measures the average cluster pollution over all clusters: clustersno doublesno cp clustersno i sizecluster j ij i _ _ _ _ ∑ ∑ = where no_doublesij is the number of indiscernible un-similar objects associated with the j-th element of cluster i. Remark: Even though there is a certain influence, it could be proven in [5] that no significant correlation exists between parameter p of the quantisation model and cluster pollution. 4.3 Test environment As pointed out above, to generate the descriptors, the MPEG-7 reference implementation in version 5.6 was used (provided by TU Munich). Image processing was done with Adobe Photoshop and normalisation and all evaluations were done with Perl. The querying process was performed in the following steps: (1) random selection of a ground truth group, (2) random selection of a query object from this group, (3) distance comparison for all other objects in the dataset, (4) clustering of the resulting distance space based on the ground truth and finally, (5) evaluation. For each combination of dataset and distance measure 250 queries were issued and evaluations were aggregated over all datasets and descriptors. The next section shows the - partially surprisingresults. 5. RESULTS In the results presented below the first indicator from Subsection 4.2 was used to evaluate distance measures. In a first step parameter p had to be set in a way that all measures are equally discriminant. Distance measurement is fair if the following condition holds true for any predicate-based measure dP and any continuous measure dC: ( ) ( )CP dcppdcp ≈, Then, it is guaranteed that predicate-based measures do not create larger clusters (with a higher number of similar objects) for the price of higher cluster pollution. In more than 1000 test queries the optimum value was found to be p=1. Results are organised as follows: Subsection 5.1 summarises the Figure 1. Test datasets. Left: Brodatz dataset, middle: Corel dataset, right: coats-of-arms dataset. 135 best distance measures per descriptor, Section 5.2 shows the best overall distance measures and Section 5.3 points out other interesting results (for example, distance measures that work particularly good on specific ground truth groups). 5.1 Best measure per descriptor Figure 2 shows the evaluation results for the first indicator. For each descriptor the best measure and the performance of the MPEG-7 recommendation are shown. The results are aggregated over the tested datasets. On first sight, it becomes clear that the MPEG-7 recommendations are mostly relatively good but never the best. For Color Layout the difference between MP7 and the best measure, the Meehl index (Q8), is just 4% and the MPEG-7 measure has a smaller standard deviation. The reason why the Meehl index is better may be that this descriptors generates descriptions with elements that have very similar variance. Statistical analysis confirmed that (see [6]). For Color Structure, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Region-based Shape and Scalable Color by far the best measure is pattern difference (P6). Psychological research on human visual perception has revealed that in many situation differences between the query object and a candidate weigh much stronger than common properties. The pattern difference measure implements this insight in the most consequent way. In the authors opinion, the reason why pattern difference performs so extremely well on many descriptors is due to this fact. Additional advantages of pattern difference are that it usually has a very low variance andbecause it is a predicate-based measure - its discriminance (and cluster structure) can be tuned with parameter p. The best measure for Dominant Color turned out to be Clarks Divergence coefficient (Q4). This is a similar measure to pattern difference on the continuous domain. The Texture Browsing descriptor is a special problem. In the MPEG-7 standard it is recommended to use it exclusively for browsing. After testing it for retrieval on various distance measures the author supports this opinion. It is very difficult to find a good distance measure for Texture Browsing. The proposed Manhattan metric, for example, performs very bad. The best measure is predicate-based (P7). It works on common properties (a, d) but produces clusters with very high cluster pollution. For this descriptor the second indicator is up to eight times higher than for predicate-based measures on other descriptors. 5.2 Best overall measures Figure 3 summarises the results over all descriptors and media collections. The diagram should give an indication on the general potential of the investigated distance measures for visual information retrieval. It can be seen that the best overall measure is a predicate-based one. The top performance of pattern difference (P6) proves that the quantisation model is a reasonable method to extend predicate-based distance measures on the continuous domain. The second best group of measures are the MPEG-7 recommendations, which have a slightly higher mean but a lower standard deviation than pattern difference. The third best measure is the Meehl index (Q8), a measure developed for psychological applications but because of its characteristic properties tailormade for certain (homogeneous) descriptors. Minkowski metrics are also among the best measures: the average mean and variance of the Manhattan metric (Q1) and the Euclidean metric (Q2) are in the range of Q8. Of course, these measures do not perform particularly well for any of the descriptors. Remarkably for a predicate-based measure, Tverskys Feature Contrast Model (P1) is also in the group of very good measures (even though it is not among the best) that ends with Q5, the correlation coefficient. The other measures either have a significantly higher mean or a very large standard deviation. 5.3 Other interesting results Distance measures that perform in average worse than others may in certain situations (e.g. on specific content) still perform better. For Color Layout, for example, Q7 is a very good measure on colour photos. It performs as good as Q8 and has a lower standard deviation. For artificial images the pattern difference and the Hamming distance produce comparable results as well.

CONCLUSION The evaluation presented in this paper aims at testing the recommended distance measures and finding better ones for the basic visual MPEG-7 descriptors. Eight descriptors were selected, 38 distance measures were implemented, media collections were created and assessed, performance indicators were defined and more than 22500 tests were performed. To be able to use predicate-based distance measures next to quantitative measures a quantisation model was defined that allows the application of predicate-based measures on continuous data. In the evaluation the best overall distance measures for visual content - as extracted by the visual MPEG-7 descriptors - turned out to be the pattern difference measure and the Meehl index (for homogeneous descriptions). Since these two measures perform significantly better than the MPEG-7 recommendations they should be further tested on large collections of image and video content (e.g. from [15]). The choice of the right distance function for similarity measurement depends on the descriptor, the queried media collection and the semantic level of the users idea of similarity. This work offers suitable distance measures for various situations. In consequence, the distance measures identified as the best will be implemented in the open MPEG-7 based visual information retrieval framework VizIR [4].

La evaluación presentada en este documento tiene como objetivo demostrar que las medidas de distancia sugeridas por el grupo MPEG-7 para los descriptores visuales pueden ser superados por medidas de uso general. Se seleccionaron ocho descriptores visuales de MPEG-7 y se implementaron 38 medidas de distancia. Se crearon y evaluaron tres colecciones de medios, se desarrollaron indicadores de rendimiento y se realizaron más de 22500 pruebas. Además, se desarrolló un modelo de cuantización para poder usar medidas de distancia basadas en predicados en datos continuos. La evaluación muestra que las medidas de distancia recomendadas en el estándar MPEG-7 están entre las mejores, pero que otras medidas funcionan aún mejor. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y recuperación de información]: Búsqueda y recuperación de información: filtrado de información, formulación de consultas, modelos de recuperación. Algoritmos de términos generales, medición, experimentación, rendimiento, teoría.1. Introducción El estándar MPEG -7 define, entre otros, un conjunto de descriptores para medios visuales. Cada descriptor consiste en un mecanismo de extracción de características, una descripción (en formato binario y XML) y pautas que definen cómo aplicar el descriptor en diferentes tipos de medios (por ejemplo, en medios temporales). Los descriptores MPEG -7 han sido cuidadosamente diseñados para cumplir: requisitos parcialmente complementarios de diferentes dominios de aplicación: archivo, navegación, recuperación, etc. [9]. A continuación, trataremos exclusivamente los descriptores visuales de MPEG-7 en el contexto de la recuperación de los medios. Los descriptores visuales MPEG-7 caen en cinco grupos: color, textura, forma, movimiento y otros (por ejemplo, descripción de la cara) y resumen hasta 16 descriptores básicos. Para las aplicaciones de recuperación, una regla para cada descriptor es obligatoria que define cómo medir la similitud de dos descripciones. Las reglas comunes son funciones de distancia, como la distancia euclidiana y la distancia de Mahalanobis. Desafortunadamente, el estándar MPEG-7 no incluye medidas de distancia en la parte normativa, porque no fue diseñado para ser (y no se debe entender exclusivamente como) específico de la recuperación. Sin embargo, los autores MPEG-7 dan recomendaciones, qué medida de distancia utilizar en un descriptor particular. Estas recomendaciones se basan en un conocimiento preciso del comportamiento de los descriptores y las estructuras de descripción. En el presente estudio, se implementó y aplicó una gran cantidad de medidas de distancia exitosas de diferentes áreas (estadísticas, psicología, medicina, ciencias sociales y económicas, etc.) en los vectores de datos MPEG-7 para verificar si la distancia MPEG-7 recomendada recomendó o no.Las medidas son realmente las mejores para cualquier clase razonable de objetos de medios. A partir de las pruebas MPEG-7 y las recomendaciones, no queda clara, cuántas y qué medidas de distancia se han probado en los descriptores visuales y los conjuntos de datos de prueba MPEG-7. La hipótesis es que las medidas de distancia derivadas analíticamente pueden ser buenas en general, pero solo un análisis cuantitativo es capaz de identificar la mejor medida de distancia para un método de extracción de características específico. El papel está organizado de la siguiente manera. La Sección 2 proporciona un mínimo de información de fondo sobre los descriptores MPEG-7 y la medición de la distancia en la recuperación de información visual (VIR, ver [3], [16]). La Sección 3 ofrece una visión general sobre las medidas de distancia implementadas. La Sección 4 describe la configuración de la prueba, incluidos los datos de prueba y los métodos de evaluación implementados. Finalmente, la Sección 5 presenta los resultados por descriptor y sobre todos los descriptores.2. Antecedentes 2.1 MPEG-7: descriptores visuales La parte visual del estándar MPEG-7 define varios descriptores. No todos son realmente descriptores en el sentido de que extraen propiedades de los medios visuales. Algunos de ellos son solo estructuras para la agregación de descriptores o localización. Los descriptores básicos son el diseño de color, la estructura de color, el color dominante, el color escalable, el histograma de borde, la textura homogénea, la navegación de textura, la forma basada en la región, la forma basada en el contorno, el movimiento de la cámara, el movimiento paramétrico y la actividad de movimiento. Otros descriptores se basan en descriptores de bajo nivel o información semántica: color de grupo de marcos/grupos de imágenes (basado en color escalable), forma 3D (basada en información de malla 3D), trayectoria de movimiento (basada en la segmentación de objetos)y reconocimiento facial (basado en la extracción de la cara). Los descriptores para la agregación y la localización espacio -temporal son: coordenadas 2D espaciales, diseño de cuadrícula, localizador de región (espacial), series de tiempo, interpolación temporal (temporal) y localizador espacio -temporal (combinado). Finalmente, existen otras estructuras para espacios de color, cuantificación de color y múltiples vistas 2D de objetos 3D. Estas estructuras adicionales permiten combinar los descriptores básicos de múltiples maneras y en diferentes niveles. Pero no cambian las características de la información extraída. En consecuencia, las estructuras para la agregación y la localización no se consideraron en el trabajo descrito en este documento.2.2 Medición de similitud en datos visuales En general, la medición de similitud en la información visual tiene como objetivo imitar la percepción de similitud visual humana. Desafortunadamente, la percepción humana es mucho más compleja que cualquiera de los modelos de similitud existentes (incluye percepción, reconocimiento y subjetividad). El enfoque común en la recuperación de la información visual es medir la similitud como la distancia. Tanto el objeto de consulta como el objeto candidato están representados por sus vectores de características correspondientes. La distancia entre estos objetos se mide calculando la distancia entre los dos vectores. En consecuencia, el proceso es independiente del paradigma de consulta empleado (por ejemplo, consulta por ejemplo). El objeto de consulta puede ser natural (por ejemplo, un objeto real) o artificial (por ejemplo, propiedades de un grupo de objetos). El objetivo del proceso de medición es expresar una relación entre los dos objetos por su distancia. La iteración para múltiples candidatos permite definir un orden parcial sobre los candidatos y abordar aquellos en un vecindario (para definirse) que es similar al objeto de consulta. En este punto, debe mencionarse que en un entorno multidescriptor especialmente en MPEG-7, solo estamos a la mitad de una declaración sobre similitud. Si se utilizan múltiples descriptores (por ejemplo, un esquema descriptor), se debe definir una regla sobre cómo combinar todas las distancias a un valor global para cada objeto. Aún así, la medición de distancia es el primer paso más importante en la medición de similitud. Obviamente, la tarea principal de buenas medidas de distancia es reorganizar el espacio descriptor de una manera que los objetos de los medios con la mayor similitud están más cerca del objeto de consulta. Si la distancia se define mínima, el objeto de consulta siempre está en el origen del espacio de distancia y los candidatos similares deben formar grupos alrededor del origen que son lo más grandes posible. En consecuencia, muchas medidas de distancia bien conocidas se basan en supuestos geométricos del espacio descriptor (p. Ej. La distancia euclidiana se basa en los axiomas métricos). Desafortunadamente, estas medidas no encajan idealmente con la percepción de similitud humana (por ejemplo, debido a la subjetividad humana). Para superar esta escasez, los investigadores de diferentes áreas han desarrollado modelos alternativos que en su mayoría están basados en predicados (se supone que los descriptores contienen solo elementos binarios, p. Tverskys cuentan con el modelo de contraste [17]) y se ajusta mejor con la percepción humana. En la siguiente distancia, se considerarán medidas de ambos grupos de enfoques.3. Medidas de distancia Las medidas de distancia utilizadas en este trabajo se han recogido de varias áreas (subsección 3.1). Debido a que trabajan en datos cuantificados de manera diferente, la subsección 3.2 dibuja un modelo para la unificación sobre la base de descripciones cuantitativas. Finalmente, la subsección 3.3 introduce las medidas de distancia, así como su origen y la idea que implementan.3.1 Fuentes La medición de la distancia se utiliza en muchas áreas de investigación, como psicología, sociología (por ejemplo, comparación de resultados de las pruebas), medicina (por ejemplo, comparación de parámetros de las personas de prueba), economía (por ejemplo, comparación con las proporciones del balance), etc. Naturalmente, el carácter de los datos disponibles en estas áreas difiere significativamente. Esencialmente, hay dos casos extremos de vectores de datos (y medidas de distancia): predicadas (todos los elementos vectoriales son binarios, por ejemplo, {0, 1}) y cuantitativos (todos los elementos vectoriales son continuos, por ejemplo, [0, 1]). Los predicados expresan la existencia de propiedades y representan información de alto nivel, mientras que los valores cuantitativos pueden usarse para medir y en su mayoría representan información de bajo nivel. Los predicados a menudo se emplean en psicología, sociología y otras ciencias relacionadas con los humanos y, por lo tanto, la mayoría de las medidas de distancia basadas en predicados se desarrollaron en estas áreas. Las descripciones en la recuperación de información visual son casi siempre cuantitativas (si no integran información semántica). En consecuencia, en su mayoría se utilizan medidas de distancia cuantitativas en la recuperación de información visual. El objetivo de este trabajo es comparar las medidas de distancia MPEG-7 con las medidas de distancia más potentes desarrolladas en otras áreas. Dado que las descripciones de MPEG-7 son puramente cuantitativas, pero algunas de las medidas de distancia más sofisticadas se definen exclusivamente en predicados, un modelo es obligatorio que permite la aplicación de medidas de distancia basadas en predicados en datos cuantitativos. El modelo desarrollado para este propósito se presenta en la siguiente sección.3.2 Modelo de cuantización El objetivo del modelo de cuantización es redefinir los operadores establecidos que generalmente se usan en medidas de distancia basadas en predicados en datos continuos. La primera en la recuperación de información visual en seguir este enfoque fueron Santini y Jain, quienes intentaron aplicar el modelo de contraste de características de Tverskys [17] a la recuperación de imágenes basada en el contenido [12], [13]. Interpretaron datos continuos como predicados difusos y usaron operadores de conjunto difuso. Desafortunadamente, su modelo sufrió varias deficiencias que describieron en [12], [13] (por ejemplo, el modelo cuantitativo funcionó solo para una versión específica de la medida original basada en predicadas). La idea principal del modelo de cuantización presentado es que los operadores establecidos son reemplazados por funciones estadísticas. En [5], los autores podrían mostrar que esta interpretación de los operadores SET es razonable. El modelo ofrece una solución para los descriptores considerados en la evaluación. No es específico para una medida de distancia, pero se puede aplicar a cualquier medida basada en predicados. A continuación, se mostrará que el modelo no solo funciona para datos de predicados sino también para datos cuantitativos. Cada medida que implementa el modelo se puede utilizar como sustituto de la medida original basada en predicadas. En general, las propiedades binarias de dos objetos (por ejemplo, objetos de medios) pueden existir en ambos objetos (denotados como A), solo uno (B, C) o en ninguno de ellos (D). El operador necesario para estas relaciones es unión, menos y no. En el modelo de cuantización se reemplazan de la siguiente manera (ver [5] para obtener más detalles).131 ∑     ≤ + - + == ∩ = k jkikjkik kkji más xx mif xx ssxxa 0 22, 1ε () () ∑ ∑ ∑     ≤ ++ - == ¬∩¬ =                      ≤−−− ==−=    ≤−−− ==−= k jkikjkik kkji k ikjkikjk kkij k jkikjkik kkji else xx if xx MssXXd else xxMifxx ssXXc else xxMifxx ssXXb 0 22, 0 , 0 , 1 22 ε ε ε con: () [] () {} 0 \\.0 1.0 1, 2 2 1 Minmax maxmin + ∈ - =     ≥       - = =    ≥      - = - = ∈ = ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ rp rp rp rpki x donde más pif p m ki x donde más pif p m xxm xxxwithxx i k ik i k ik ikiki µ σ σ σ ε µ µ µ ε A selecciona propiedades que están presentes en ambos vectores de datos (XI, XJ representan objetos de medios), By C seleccione Propiedades que están presentes en solo una de ellas y D selecciona propiedades que están presentes en ninguno de los dos vectores de datos. Cada propiedad se selecciona en la medida en que está presente (A y D: media, B y C: diferencia) y solo si la cantidad a la que está presente excede un cierto umbral (dependiendo de la media y la desviación estándar sobre todos los elementosde espacio descriptor). La implementación de estos operadores se basa en una suposición. Se supone que los elementos vectoriales miden en la escala de intervalo. Eso significa que cada elemento expresa que la propiedad medida está más o menos presente (0: en absoluto, m: completamente presente). Esto es cierto para la mayoría de los descriptores visuales y todos los descriptores MPEG-7. No se necesita un origen natural como se supone aquí (0). La introducción de P (llamado parámetro de definición de discriminancia) para los umbrales 21, εε tiene la consecuencia positiva de que A, B, C, D se puede controlar a través de un solo parámetro.P es un criterio adicional para el comportamiento de una medida de distancia y determina los umbrales utilizados en los operadores. Expresa cómo están presentes los elementos de datos precisos (cuantización) y, en consecuencia, cuán precisos deben investigarse.P puede ser establecido por el usuario o automáticamente. Interesantes son los límites: 1. MP → ⇒∞ → 21, εε En este caso, se supone que todos los elementos (= propiedades) son continuos (cuantificación alta). En consecuencia, los operadores utilizan todas las propiedades de un descriptor. Entonces, la medida de distancia no es discriminante para las propiedades.2. 0,0 21 → ⇒ → εεp En este caso, se supone que todas las propiedades son predicados. En consecuencia, los operadores usan solo elementos binarios (= predicados) (cuantificación de 1 bits). La medida de distancia es altamente discriminante para las propiedades. Entre estos límites, una medida de distancia que utiliza el modelo de cuantización es, dependiendo de P, más o menos discriminante para las propiedades. Esto significa que selecciona un subconjunto de todos los elementos de vectores de descripción disponibles para la medición de la distancia. Tanto para datos de predicado como para datos cuantitativos, se puede demostrar que el modelo de cuantización es razonable. Si la descripción de los vectores consisten solo en elementos binarios, P debe usarse de la siguiente manera (por ejemplo, P se puede establecer fácilmente automáticamente): () σµεε, min .., 0,0 21 == ⇒ → PGEP En este caso, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,B, C, D Medir como los operadores establecidos que reemplazan. Por ejemplo, la Tabla 1 muestra su comportamiento para dos vectores de características ontimensionales XI y XJ. Como se puede ver, las medidas estadísticas funcionan como operadores de establecimientos. En realidad, el modelo de cuantización funciona con precisión en los datos de predicado para cualquier p ≠ ∞. Para mostrar que el modelo es razonable para los datos cuantitativos, se utiliza el siguiente hecho. Es fácil demostrar que para los datos de predicados algunas medidas de distancia cuantitativas degeneran a medidas predicadas. Por ejemplo, la métrica L1 (métrica de Manhattan) degenera a la distancia de hamming (desde [9], sin pesos): DistanceHammingcbxxl k jkik =+≡ - = ∑1 si se puede demostrar que el modelo de cuantificación puede reconstruir la cuantitativa de la cuantitativaMedida de la medida basada en predicadas degeneradas, el modelo obviamente puede extender las medidas basadas en predicadas al dominio cuantitativo. Esto es fácil de ilustrar. Para los vectores de características puramente cuantitativas, P debe usarse de la siguiente manera (nuevamente, P se puede establecer fácilmente automáticamente): 1, 21 = ⇒ ⇒ → εεp, A y D se convierten en funciones continuas: ∑ ∑ + - == ⇒ deseuv ++ == ⇒ ama≤ + - k jkik kk jkik k jkik kk jkik xx mswheresdtruem xx xx swheresatresatreatruem xx m 22 22 byc puede hacerse continuo para las siguientes expresiones: () () ∑ ∑ ∑ - == + ⇒                               ≥−−– == ⇒ ≥ - • Oímel0 0 0 0 Tabla 1.

Esto demuestra que el modelo es razonable. A continuación, se utilizará para extender medidas de distancia basadas en predicados exitosos en el dominio cuantitativo. Las principales ventajas del modelo de cuantización son: (1) Es independiente del dominio de la aplicación, (2) la implementación es sencilla, (3) el modelo es fácil de usar y finalmente, (4) el nuevo parámetro P permite controlar la similitudProceso de medición de una nueva manera (discriminancia en el nivel de propiedad).3.3 Medidas implementadas para la evaluación descrita en este trabajo junto al predicado (basado en el modelo de cuantificación) y medidas cuantitativas, se implementaron las medidas de distancia recomendadas en el estándar MPEG-7 (todas las 38 medidas de distancia diferentes). La Tabla 2 resume las medidas basadas en predicados que se desempeñaron mejor en la evaluación (en la suma 20 se investigaron las medidas basadas en predicadas). Para estas medidas, K es el número de predicados en los vectores de datos XI y XJ. En P1, la suma se usa para Tverskys f () (como lo hace el propio Tversky en [17]) y α, β son pesos para el elemento B y C.En [5], los autores investigaron el modelo de contraste de Tverskys y encontraron α = 1, β = 0 para ser los parámetros óptimos. Algunas de las medidas basadas en predicados son muy simples (p. Ej. P2, P4) pero se han explotado fuertemente en la investigación psicológica. La diferencia de patrones (P6), una medida muy poderosa, se utiliza en el paquete de estadísticas SPSS para el análisis de clúster. P7 es un coeficiente de correlación para los predicados desarrollados por Pearson. La Tabla 3 muestra las mejores medidas de distancia cuantitativas que se utilizaron. Q1 y Q2 están basados en métricos y se implementaron como representantes de todo el grupo de distancias de Minkowski. Los WI son pesos. En Q5, II σµ, son desviación media y estándar para los elementos del descriptor xi. En Q6, M es 2 m (= 0.5). Q3, la métrica Canberra, es una forma normalizada de Q1. Del mismo modo, Q4, el coeficiente de divergencia de Clarks es una versión normalizada de Q2. Q6 es un coeficiente de correlación desarrollado adicional que es invariante contra los cambios de signo. Esta medida se utiliza a pesar de que sus propiedades particulares son de menor importancia para este dominio de aplicación. Finalmente, Q8 es una medida que tiene en cuenta las diferencias entre los elementos vectoriales adyacentes. Esto lo hace estructuralmente diferente de todas las demás medidas. Obviamente, falta una medida de distancia importante. No se consideró la distancia de Mahalanobis, porque diferentes descriptores requerirían diferentes matrices de covarianza y para algunos descriptores es simplemente imposible definir una matriz de covarianza. Si la matriz de identidad se usara en este caso, la distancia de Mahalanobis degeneraría a una distancia de Minkowski. Además, las distancias MPEG-7 recomendadas se implementaron con los siguientes parámetros: en la medida de distancia del descriptor de diseño de color, todos los pesos se establecieron en 1 (como en todas las demás medidas implementadas). En la medida de distancia del descriptor de color dominante se usaron los siguientes parámetros: 20,1,3.0,7.0 21 ==== DTWW α (como se recomienda). En la distancia de descriptores de textura homogénea, todos () kα se establecieron en 1 y la coincidencia se realizó rotación y a escala invariante. ¡Importante! Algunas de las medidas presentadas en esta sección son medidas de distancia, mientras que otras son medidas de similitud. Para las pruebas, es importante notar que todas las medidas de similitud se invirtieron a medidas de distancia.4. La subsección de configuración de prueba 4.1 describe los descriptores (incluidos los parámetros) y las colecciones (incluida la información de la verdad de tierra) que se utilizaron en la evaluación. La subsección 4.2 discute el método de evaluación que se implementó y la subsección 4.3 dibuja el entorno de prueba utilizado para el proceso de evaluación.4.1 Datos de prueba para la evaluación Se utilizaron ocho descriptores MPEG-7. Todos los descriptores de color: diseño de color, estructura de color, color dominante, color escalable, todos los descriptores de textura: histograma de borde, textura homogénea, navegación de textura y descriptor de una forma: forma basada en la región. Se utilizó la navegación de textura a pesar de que el estándar MPEG-7 sugiere que no es adecuado para la recuperación. El otro descriptor de forma básica, la forma basada en el contorno, no se utilizó, ya que produce descripciones estructuralmente diferentes que no pueden transformarse en vectores de datos con elementos que miden en escalas de intervalos. Los descriptores de movimiento no se usaron, porque integran la dimensión temporal de los medios visuales y solo serían comparables, si los descriptores básicos de color, textura y forma se agregarían con el tiempo. Esto no se hizo. Finalmente, no se utilizaron descriptores de alto nivel (localización, reconocimiento facial, etc., ver la subsección 2.1), porque, a la opinión de los autores, el comportamiento de los descriptores básicos en los objetos de los medios elementales debe evaluarse antes de que se puedandibujado.

Se usó una métrica de Manhattan para medir la proximidad (ver [6] para más detalles). La extracción del descriptor se realizó utilizando la implementación de referencia MPEG-7. En el proceso de extracción, se aplicó cada descriptor en todo el contenido de cada objeto de medios y se utilizaron los siguientes parámetros de extracción. El color en la estructura de color se cuantificó a 32 contenedores. Para el espacio de color de color dominante se estableció en YCRCB, se utilizó cuantización predeterminada de 5 bits y se utilizó el valor predeterminado para la coherencia espacial. La textura homogénea se cuantificó a 32 componentes. Los valores de color escalable se cuantificaron a sizeOf (int) -3 bits y se usaron 64 contenedores. Finalmente, la navegación de textura se usó con cinco componentes. Estos descriptores se aplicaron en tres colecciones de medios con contenido de imagen: el conjunto de datos Brodatz (112 imágenes, 512x512 píxeles), un subconjunto del conjunto de datos Corel (260 imágenes, 460x300 píxeles, retrato y paisaje) y un conjunto de datos con imágenes de arms de arms(426 imágenes, 200x200 píxeles). La Figura 1 muestra ejemplos de las tres colecciones. El diseño de conjuntos de pruebas apropiados para una evaluación visual es una tarea muy difícil (por ejemplo, consulte el informe TREC Video 2002 [15]). Por supuesto, para identificar la mejor medida de distancia para un descriptor, debe probarse en un número infinito de objetos de medios. Pero este no es el objetivo de este estudio. Simplemente se evalúa si, para las posibles colecciones de imágenes, se pueden encontrar mejores medidas de proximidad que las sugeridas por el grupo MPEG -7. Las colecciones de este tamaño relativamente pequeño se usaron en la evaluación, porque los métodos de evaluación aplicados están por encima de un cierto tamaño mínimo invariante contra el tamaño de la recolección y para colecciones más pequeñas es más fácil definir una verdad terrestre de alta calidad. Aún así, la relación promedio del tamaño de la verdad del suelo al tamaño de la recolección es al menos 1: 7. Especialmente, no se utilizó ninguna colección del conjunto de datos MPEG-7 en la evaluación porque las evaluaciones deberían mostrar qué tan bien funcionan los descriptores y las medidas de distancia recomendadas en material desconocido. Cuando se terminó la extracción del descriptor, las descripciones XML resultantes se transformaron en una matriz de datos con 798 líneas (objetos de medios) y 314 columnas (elementos descriptores). Para ser utilizable con medidas de distancia que no integran el conocimiento del dominio, los elementos de esta matriz de datos se normalizaron a [0, 1]. Para la evaluación de la distancia: se necesita el juicio de similitud de matrixhumano de datos normalizados. En este trabajo, la verdad de tierra está construida de doce grupos de imágenes similares (cuatro para cada conjunto de datos). La membresía grupal fue calificada por humanos basados en criterios semánticos. La Tabla 4 resume los doce grupos y las descripciones subyacentes. Debe notarse que algunos de estos grupos (especialmente 5, 7 y 10) son mucho más difíciles de encontrar con descriptores de bajo nivel que otros.4.2 Método de evaluación Por lo general, la evaluación de recuperación se realiza en función de una verdad terrestre con recuerdo y precisión (ver, por ejemplo, [3], [16]). En entornos multidociadores esto conduce a un problema, porque los valores de recuperación y precisión resultantes están fuertemente influenciados por el método utilizado para fusionar los valores de distancia para un objeto de medios. Aunque es casi imposible decir lo grande que fue la influencia de una medida de distancia en el recuerdo y los valores de precisión resultantes, este problema ha sido casi ignorado hasta ahora. En la subsección 2.2 se afirmó que la tarea principal de una medida de distancia es acercar los objetos de los medios relevantes lo más cerca posible del origen (donde se encuentra el objeto de consulta). Incluso en un entorno multidocipante, es fácil identificar los objetos similares en un espacio de gran distancia. En consecuencia, se decidió a la Tabla 3. Medidas de distancia cuantitativa.

Identificar grupos de objetos similares (basados en la verdad terrestre dada) es relativamente fácil, porque el espacio de distancia resultante para un descriptor y cualquier medida de distancia siempre es unidimensional. Los grupos se encuentran buscando desde el origen del espacio de distancia hasta el primer objeto similar, agrupando todos los siguientes objetos similares en el clúster, rompiendo el clúster con el primer objeto no similar, etc. Para la evaluación se definieron dos indicadores. La primera mide la distancia promedio de todos los medios de clúster para el origen: distanceavgclustersno sizecluster distancEclustersno i i sizeCluster j ij d i _._ _ _ _ ∑ ∑ = µ donde la distancia es el valor de distancia del elemento j-th en el clúster i-th, ∑ ∑ ∑ = Clusters I I I Registros I SizeCluster J IJ SizeCluster Distancia distanceavg I _ _ _, NO_CLUSTERS es el número de grupos encontrados y clúster_sizei es el tamaño del clúster i-th. El indicador resultante se normaliza mediante las características de distribución de la medida de distancia (AVG_DISTANCE). Además, se utiliza la desviación estándar. En el proceso de evaluación, esta medida resultó producir resultados valiosos y ser relativamente robusto contra el parámetro P del modelo de cuantización. En la subsección 3.2 notamos que P afecta la discriminancia de una medida de distancia basada en predicadas: la P más pequeña se establece, los grupos más grandes son los grupos resultantes porque el modelo de cuantización es más discriminante contra las propiedades y se utilizan menos elementos de la matriz de datos. Esto provoca un efecto secundario que se mide por el segundo indicador: cada vez más objetos no similar salen con exactamente el mismo valor de distancia que objetos similares (un problema que no existe para PS grande) y se vuelven indiscernibles de objetos similares. En consecuencia, son miembros del clúster (falsos). Este fenómeno (conceptualmente similar al indicador de falsos negativos) se llamaba contaminación del clúster y el indicador mide la contaminación promedio del clúster sobre todos los clústeres: clustersno doblesno cp clustersno i sizecluster j ij i _ _ _ _ ∑ = donde no_doublesij es el número de indiscernibleObjetos no similar asociados con el elemento j-th del clúster i. Observación: Aunque hay una cierta influencia, podría demostrarse en [5] que no existe una correlación significativa entre el parámetro P del modelo de cuantificación y la contaminación del grupo.4.3 Entorno de prueba como se señaló anteriormente, para generar los descriptores, se utilizó la implementación de referencia MPEG-7 en la versión 5.6 (proporcionada por Tu Munich). El procesamiento de la imagen se realizó con Adobe Photoshop y la normalización y todas las evaluaciones se realizaron con Perl. El proceso de consulta se realizó en los siguientes pasos: (1) Selección aleatoria de un grupo de verdad de tierra, (2) selección aleatoria de un objeto de consulta de este grupo, (3) comparación de distancia para todos los demás objetos en el conjunto de datos, (4)Agrupación del espacio de distancia resultante basado en la verdad del suelo y finalmente, (5) evaluación. Para cada combinación de conjunto de datos y medidas de distancia, se emitieron 250 consultas y las evaluaciones se agregaron a través de todos los conjuntos de datos y descriptores. La siguiente sección muestra los resultados parcialmente sorprendentes.5. Los resultados en los resultados presentados por debajo del primer indicador de la subsección 4.2 se usaron para evaluar las medidas de distancia. En un primer paso, el parámetro P tuvo que establecerse de una manera que todas las medidas sean igualmente discriminantes. La medición de la distancia es justa si la siguiente condición es válida para cualquier medida DP basada en predicadas y cualquier medida continua DC: () () CP DCPPDCP ≈, entonces, se garantiza que las medidas basadas en predicadas no crean grupos más grandes (con un mayornúmero de objetos similares) para el precio de una mayor contaminación del clúster. En más de 1000 consultas de prueba, se encontró que el valor óptimo era p = 1. Los resultados se organizan de la siguiente manera: la subsección 5.1 resume la Figura 1. Prueba de datos. Izquierda: conjunto de datos Brodatz, Middle: Corel DataSet, derecha: conjunto de datos de brazos.135 Mejores medidas de distancia por descriptor, la Sección 5.2 muestra las mejores medidas de distancia generales y la Sección 5.3 señala otros resultados interesantes (por ejemplo, medidas de distancia que funcionan particularmente bien en grupos de verdad de tierra específicos).5.1 La mejor medida por descriptor La Figura 2 muestra los resultados de la evaluación para el primer indicador. Para cada descriptor, se muestra la mejor medida y el rendimiento de la recomendación MPEG-7. Los resultados se agregan sobre los conjuntos de datos probados. A primera vista, queda claro que las recomendaciones MPEG-7 son en su mayoría relativamente buenas, pero nunca son las mejores. Para el diseño del color, la diferencia entre MP7 y la mejor medida, el índice MeeHL (Q8) es solo del 4% y la medida MPEG-7 tiene una desviación estándar más pequeña. La razón por la cual el índice MEEHL es mejor puede ser que este descriptores genera descripciones con elementos que tienen una varianza muy similar. El análisis estadístico confirmó que (ver [6]). Para la estructura de color, el histograma de borde, la textura homogénea, la forma basada en la región y el color escalable, con mucho, la mejor medida es la diferencia de patrones (P6). La investigación psicológica sobre la percepción visual humana ha revelado que en muchas diferencias de situación entre el objeto de consulta y un candidato pesan mucho más fuertes que las propiedades comunes. La medida de diferencia de patrones implementa esta idea de la manera más consecuente. En la opinión de los autores, la razón por la cual la diferencia de patrones funciona tan bien en muchos descriptores se debe a este hecho. Las ventajas adicionales de la diferencia de patrones son que generalmente tiene una varianza muy baja y porque es una medida basada en predicadas: su discriminancia (y estructura de clúster) se puede ajustar con el parámetro p.La mejor medida para el color dominante resultó ser el coeficiente de divergencia de Clarks (Q4). Esta es una medida similar a la diferencia de patrones en el dominio continuo. El descriptor de navegación de textura es un problema especial. En el estándar MPEG-7 se recomienda usarlo exclusivamente para navegar. Después de probarlo para recuperarlo en varias medidas de distancia, el autor respalda esta opinión. Es muy difícil encontrar una buena medida de distancia para la navegación de textura. La métrica propuesta de Manhattan, por ejemplo, funciona muy mal. La mejor medida se basa en el predicado (P7). Funciona en propiedades comunes (A, D) pero produce grupos con muy alta contaminación de clúster. Para este descriptor, el segundo indicador es hasta ocho veces mayor que para las medidas basadas en predicados en otros descriptores.5.2 Las mejores medidas generales La Figura 3 resume los resultados sobre todos los descriptores y colecciones de medios. El diagrama debe dar una indicación sobre el potencial general de las medidas de distancia investigadas para la recuperación de información visual. Se puede ver que la mejor medida general es una basada en predicados. El rendimiento superior de la diferencia de patrones (P6) demuestra que el modelo de cuantización es un método razonable para extender las medidas de distancia basadas en predicados en el dominio continuo. El segundo mejor grupo de medidas son las recomendaciones MPEG-7, que tienen una media ligeramente más alta pero una desviación estándar más baja que la diferencia de patrones. La tercera mejor medida es el índice MEEHL (Q8), una medida desarrollada para aplicaciones psicológicas, pero debido a sus propiedades características, TailMade para ciertos descriptores (homogéneos). Las métricas de Minkowski también se encuentran entre las mejores medidas: la media promedio y la varianza de la métrica de Manhattan (Q1) y la métrica euclidiana (Q2) están en el rango de Q8. Por supuesto, estas medidas no funcionan particularmente bien para ninguno de los descriptores. Sorprendentemente para una medida basada en predicadas, el modelo de contraste de características de Tverskys (P1) también está en el grupo de muy buenas medidas (aunque no se encuentra entre las mejores) que termina con Q5, el coeficiente de correlación. Las otras medidas tienen una media media significativamente más alta o una desviación estándar muy grande.5.3 Otras medidas de distancia de resultados interesantes que funcionan en promedio peor que otras pueden en ciertas situaciones (por ejemplo, en contenido específico) aún funcionan mejor. Para el diseño de color, por ejemplo, Q7 es una buena medida en las fotos en color. Funciona tan bien como Q8 y tiene una desviación estándar más baja. Para imágenes artificiales, la diferencia de patrones y la distancia de hamming también producen resultados comparables. Si la información de color está disponible en los objetos de los medios, la diferencia de patrones funciona bien en el color dominante (solo un 20% peor Q4) y en el caso de la verdad de tierra difícil (grupo 5, 7, 10), el índice MEEHL es tan fuerte como P6.0,000 0,001 0,002 0,003 0,004 0,005 0,006 0,007 0,008 Q8 MP7 P6 MP7 Q4 MP7 P6 MP7 P6 MP7 P6 MP7 P6 MP7 P7 Q2 Estructura de color del color Dominante Homog de color del borde dominante.

Conclusión La evaluación presentada en este documento tiene como objetivo probar las medidas de distancia recomendadas y encontrar mejores para los descriptores básicos visuales de MPEG-7. Se seleccionaron ocho descriptores, se implementaron 38 medidas de distancia, se crearon y evaluaron las colecciones de medios, se definieron los indicadores de rendimiento y se realizaron más de 22500 pruebas. Para poder usar medidas de distancia basadas en predicados junto a medidas cuantitativas se definió un modelo de cuantificación que permite la aplicación de medidas basadas en predicados en datos continuos. En la evaluación, las mejores medidas de distancia generales para el contenido visual, según lo extrajo los descriptores visuales de MPEG -7, resultaron ser la medida de diferencia de patrones y el índice MEEHL (para descripciones homogéneas). Dado que estas dos medidas funcionan significativamente mejor que las recomendaciones MPEG-7, deben probarse más en grandes colecciones de contenido de imagen y video (por ejemplo, de [15]). La elección de la función de distancia correcta para la medición de similitud depende del descriptor, la recopilación de medios consultado y el nivel semántico de la idea de similitud de los usuarios. Este trabajo ofrece medidas de distancia adecuadas para diversas situaciones. En consecuencia, las medidas de distancia identificadas como las mejores se implementarán en el marco de recuperación de información visual basada en MPEG-7 abierta a Vizir [4].

        "INTRODUCTION The MPEG-7 standard defines - among others - a set of descriptors for visual media.",
        "Each descriptor consists of a feature extraction mechanism, a description (in binary and XML format) and guidelines that define how to apply the descriptor on different kinds of media (e.g. on temporal media).",
        "The MPEG-7 descriptors have been carefully designed to meet - partially complementaryrequirements of different application domains: archival, browsing, retrieval, etc. [9].",
        "In the following, we will exclusively deal with the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval.",
        "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
        "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
        "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
        "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
        "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.",
        "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
        "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",
        "From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets.",
        "The hypothesis is that analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance measure for a specific feature extraction method.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives a minimum of background information on the MPEG-7 descriptors and distance measurement in visual information retrieval (VIR, see [3], [16]).",
        "Section 3 gives an overview over the implemented distance measures.",
        "Section 4 describes the test setup, including the test data and the implemented evaluation methods.",
        "Finally, Section 5 presents the results per descriptor and over all descriptors. 2.",
        "BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.",
        "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
        "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
        "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
        "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
        "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
        "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
        "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
        "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
        "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
        "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
        "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
        "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
        "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
        "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
        "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
        "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
        "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
        "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
        "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
        "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
        "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
        "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
        "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
        "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
        "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
        "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
        "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
        "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
        "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
        "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
        "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
        "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
        "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
        "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
        "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
        "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
        "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
        "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
        "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
        "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
        "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
        "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
        "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
        "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
        "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
        "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
        "It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
        "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",
        "Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.",
        "Generally, binary properties of two objects (e.g. media objects) can exist in both objects (denoted as a), in just one (b, c) or in none of them (d).",

                "Each descriptor consists of a feature extraction mechanism, a description (in binary and XML format) and guidelines that define how to apply the descriptor on different kinds of media (e.g. on temporal media).",
                "The MPEG-7 descriptors have been carefully designed to meet - partially complementaryrequirements of different application domains: archival, browsing, retrieval, etc. [9].",
                "In the following, we will exclusively deal with the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval.",
                "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
                "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
                "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
                "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
                "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which <br>distance measure</br> to use on a particular descriptor.",
                "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
                "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",
                "From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets.",
                "The hypothesis is that analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best <br>distance measure</br> for a specific feature extraction method.",
                "The paper is organised as follows.",
                "Section 2 gives a minimum of background information on the MPEG-7 descriptors and distance measurement in visual information retrieval (VIR, see [3], [16]).",

                "Section 4 describes the test setup, including the test data and the implemented evaluation methods.",
                "Finally, Section 5 presents the results per descriptor and over all descriptors. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.",
                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
                "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
                "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
                "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
                "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
                "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
                "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
                "It is not specific to one <br>distance measure</br>, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
                "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",
                "Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.",
                "Generally, binary properties of two objects (e.g. media objects) can exist in both objects (denoted as a), in just one (b, c) or in none of them (d).",
                "The operator needed for these relationships are UNION, MINUS and NOT.",

                "For example, Table 1 shows their behaviour for two onedimensional feature vectors Xi and Xj.",

                "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
                "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
                "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
                "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
                "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.",
                "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
                "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.",
                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
                "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
                "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
                "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
                "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
                "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
                "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
                "It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
                "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",
                "Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.",
                "Generally, binary properties of two objects (e.g. media objects) can exist in both objects (denoted as a), in just one (b, c) or in none of them (d).",
                "The operator needed for these relationships are UNION, MINUS and NOT.",

                "Each descriptor consists of a feature extraction mechanism, a description (in binary and XML format) and guidelines that define how to apply the descriptor on different kinds of media (e.g. on temporal media).",
                "The MPEG-7 descriptors have been carefully designed to meet - partially complementaryrequirements of different application domains: archival, browsing, retrieval, etc. [9].",
                "In the following, we will exclusively deal with the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval.",
                "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
                "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
                "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
                "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
                "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.",
                "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
                "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",
                "From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets.",
                "The hypothesis is that analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance measure for a specific feature extraction method.",
                "The paper is organised as follows.",
                "Section 2 gives a minimum of background information on the MPEG-7 descriptors and distance measurement in visual information retrieval (VIR, see [3], [16]).",

                "Section 4 describes the test setup, including the test data and the implemented evaluation methods.",
                "Finally, Section 5 presents the results per descriptor and over all descriptors. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.",
                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from <br>visual media</br>.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
                "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
                "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
                "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
                "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
                "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
                "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
                "It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
                "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",
                "Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.",
                "Generally, binary properties of two objects (e.g. media objects) can exist in both objects (denoted as a), in just one (b, c) or in none of them (d).",
                "The operator needed for these relationships are UNION, MINUS and NOT.",

                "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
                "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
                "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
                "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
                "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.",
                "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
                "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",

                "Section 4 describes the test setup, including the test data and the implemented evaluation methods.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: <br>visual descriptor</br>s The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.",
                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
                "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
                "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
                "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
                "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
                "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
                "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
                "It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
                "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",
                "Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.",
                "Generally, binary properties of two objects (e.g. media objects) can exist in both objects (denoted as a), in just one (b, c) or in none of them (d).",
                "The operator needed for these relationships are UNION, MINUS and NOT.",

                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",

                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",

                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",

                "In the following, we will exclusively deal with the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval.",
                "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
                "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
                "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
                "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
                "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.",
                "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
                "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",
                "From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets.",
                "The hypothesis is that analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance measure for a specific feature extraction method.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.",
                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",

                "In the following, we will exclusively deal with the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval.",
                "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
                "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
                "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
                "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
                "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.",
                "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
                "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",
                "From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets.",
                "The hypothesis is that analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance measure for a specific feature extraction method.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.",
                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
                "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
                "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
                "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
                "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
                "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
                "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
                "It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
                "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",
                "Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.",

                "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
                "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
                "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
                "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
                "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.",
                "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
                "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",

                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in <br>visual information retrieval</br> is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
                "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
                "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
                "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in <br>visual information retrieval</br> are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in <br>visual information retrieval</br>.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in <br>visual information retrieval</br> to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
                "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
                "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
                "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
                "It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
                "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",
                "Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.",

                "Each descriptor consists of a feature extraction mechanism, a description (in binary and XML format) and guidelines that define how to apply the descriptor on different kinds of media (e.g. on temporal media).",
                "The MPEG-7 descriptors have been carefully designed to meet - partially complementaryrequirements of different application domains: archival, browsing, retrieval, etc. [9].",
                "In the following, we will exclusively deal with the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval.",
                "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
                "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
                "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
                "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
                "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.",
                "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
                "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",
                "From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets.",
                "The hypothesis is that analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance measure for a specific feature extraction method.",

                "BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.",
                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with <br>human similarity perception</br> (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
                "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
                "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
                "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
                "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
                "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
                "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
                "It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
                "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",
                "Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.",

                "Each descriptor consists of a feature extraction mechanism, a description (in binary and XML format) and guidelines that define how to apply the descriptor on different kinds of media (e.g. on temporal media).",
                "The MPEG-7 descriptors have been carefully designed to meet - partially complementaryrequirements of different application domains: archival, browsing, retrieval, etc. [9].",
                "In the following, we will exclusively deal with the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval.",
                "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
                "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
                "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
                "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
                "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.",
                "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
                "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",
                "From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets.",
                "The hypothesis is that analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance measure for a specific feature extraction method.",
                "The paper is organised as follows.",
                "Section 2 gives a minimum of background information on the MPEG-7 descriptors and distance measurement in visual information retrieval (VIR, see [3], [16]).",
                "Section 3 gives an overview over the implemented distance measures.",
                "Section 4 describes the test setup, including the test data and the implemented evaluation methods.",
                "Finally, Section 5 presents the results per descriptor and over all descriptors. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.",
                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
                "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
                "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
                "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
                "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
                "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
                "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
                "It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
                "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",
                "Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.",
                "Generally, binary properties of two objects (e.g. media objects) can exist in both objects (denoted as a), in just one (b, c) or in none of them (d).",
                "The operator needed for these relationships are UNION, MINUS and NOT.",

                "Between these limits, a distance measure that uses the quantisation model is - depending on p - more or less discriminant for properties.",
                "This means, it selects a subset of all available description vector elements for distance measurement.",
                "For both predicate data and quantitative data it can be shown that the quantisation model is reasonable.",

                "Each descriptor consists of a feature extraction mechanism, a description (in binary and XML format) and guidelines that define how to apply the descriptor on different kinds of media (e.g. on temporal media).",
                "The MPEG-7 descriptors have been carefully designed to meet - partially complementaryrequirements of different application domains: archival, browsing, retrieval, etc. [9].",
                "In the following, we will exclusively deal with the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval.",
                "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
                "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
                "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
                "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
                "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.",
                "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
                "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",
                "From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets.",
                "The hypothesis is that analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance measure for a specific feature extraction method.",
                "The paper is organised as follows.",
                "Section 2 gives a minimum of background information on the MPEG-7 descriptors and distance measurement in visual information retrieval (VIR, see [3], [16]).",
                "Section 3 gives an overview over the implemented distance measures.",
                "Section 4 describes the test setup, including the test data and the implemented evaluation methods.",
                "Finally, Section 5 presents the results per descriptor and over all descriptors. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.",
                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
                "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
                "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
                "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
                "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
                "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
                "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
                "It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
                "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",
                "Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.",
                "Generally, binary properties of two objects (e.g. media objects) can exist in both objects (denoted as a), in just one (b, c) or in none of them (d).",
                "The operator needed for these relationships are UNION, MINUS and NOT.",

                "For example, Table 1 shows their behaviour for two onedimensional feature vectors Xi and Xj.",

                "Each descriptor consists of a feature extraction mechanism, a description (in binary and XML format) and guidelines that define how to apply the descriptor on different kinds of media (e.g. on temporal media).",
                "The MPEG-7 descriptors have been carefully designed to meet - partially complementaryrequirements of different application domains: archival, browsing, retrieval, etc. [9].",
                "In the following, we will exclusively deal with the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval.",
                "The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.",
                "For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.",
                "Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.",
                "Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.",
                "However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.",
                "These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description structures.",
                "In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.",
                "From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets.",
                "The hypothesis is that analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance measure for a specific feature extraction method.",
                "The paper is organised as follows.",
                "Section 2 gives a minimum of background information on the MPEG-7 descriptors and distance measurement in visual information retrieval (VIR, see [3], [16]).",
                "Section 3 gives an overview over the implemented distance measures.",
                "Section 4 describes the test setup, including the test data and the implemented evaluation methods.",
                "Finally, Section 5 presents the results per descriptor and over all descriptors. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.",
                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
                "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
                "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
                "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
                "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
                "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
                "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
                "It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
                "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",
                "Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.",
                "Generally, binary properties of two objects (e.g. media objects) can exist in both objects (denoted as a), in just one (b, c) or in none of them (d).",
                "The operator needed for these relationships are UNION, MINUS and NOT.",

                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 <br>similarity measurement</br> on visual data Generally, <br>similarity measurement</br> on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in <br>similarity measurement</br>.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",

                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
                "Unfortunately, their model suffered from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific version of the original predicate-based measure).",
                "The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set operators are replaced by statistical functions.",
                "In [5] the authors could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.",
                "The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the evaluation.",
                "It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be applied to any predicate-based measure.",
                "Below, it will be shown that the model does not only work for predicate data but for quantitative data as well.",

                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, <br>distance measurement</br> is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",

                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",

                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",

                "Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",

                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual <br>similarity perception</br>.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",

                "Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.",
                "Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.",
                "The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.",
                "Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).",
                "Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).",
                "Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.",
                "These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.",
                "But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.",
                "Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper. 2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.",
                "Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).",
                "The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.",
                "Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.",
                "The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.",
                "Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g. query by example).",
                "The query object may be natural (e.g. a real object) or artificial (e.g. properties of a group of objects).",
                "Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.",
                "Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.",
                "At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor environmentespecially in <br>mpeg-7</br> - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.",
                "If multiple descriptors are used (e.g. a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.",
                "Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.",
                "Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.",
                "If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.",
                "Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.",
                "Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).",
                "Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g. due to human subjectivity).",
                "To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.",
                "Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.",
                "In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 3.",
                "DISTANCE MEASURES The distance measures used in this work have been collected from various areas (Subsection 3.1).",
                "Because they work on differently quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on the basis of quantitative descriptions.",
                "Finally, Subsection 3.3 introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the idea they implement. 3.1 Sources Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g. comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing balance sheet ratios), etc.",
                "Naturally, the character of data available in these areas differs significantly.",
                "Essentially, there are two extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative (all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).",
                "Predicates express the existence of properties and represent highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure and mostly represent low-level information.",
                "Predicates are often employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were therefore developed in these areas.",
                "Descriptions in visual information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate semantic information) quantitative.",
                "Consequently, mostly quantitative distance measures are used in visual information retrieval.",
                "The goal of this work is to compare the <br>mpeg-7</br> distance measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in other areas.",
                "Since <br>mpeg-7</br> descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.",
                "The model developed for this purpose is presented in the next section. 3.2 Quantisation model The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on continuous data.",
                "The first in visual information retrieval to follow this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tverskys Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval [12], [13].",
                "They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates and used fuzzy set operators.",
