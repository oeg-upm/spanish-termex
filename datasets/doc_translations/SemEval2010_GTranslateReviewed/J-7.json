Research Santa Clara CA mahdian@yahoo-inc.com Tom Wexler Dept. of Computer Science Cornell University, Ithaca NY wexler@cs.cornell.edu ABSTRACT In many settings, competing technologies - for example, operating systems, instant messenger systems, or document formatscan be seen adopting a limited amount of compatibility with one another; in other words, the difficulty in using multiple technologies is balanced somewhere between the two extremes of impossibility and effortless interoperability. There are a range of reasons why this phenomenon occurs, many of which - based on legal, social, or business considerations - seem to defy concise mathematical models. Despite this, we show that the advantages of limited compatibility can arise in a very simple model of diffusion in social networks, thus offering a basic explanation for this phenomenon in purely strategic terms. Our approach builds on work on the diffusion of innovations in the economics literature, which seeks to model how a new technology A might spread through a social network of individuals who are currently users of technology B. We consider several ways of capturing the compatibility of A and B, focusing primarily on a model in which users can choose to adopt A, adopt B, or - at an extra cost - adopt both A and B. We characterize how the ability of A to spread depends on both its quality relative to B, and also this additional cost of adopting both, and find some surprising non-monotonicity properties in the dependence on these parameters: in some cases, for one technology to survive the introduction of another, the cost of adopting both technologies must be balanced within a narrow, intermediate range. We also extend the framework to the case of multiple technologies, where we find that a simple This work has been supported in part by NSF grants CCF0325453, IIS-0329064, CNS-0403340, and BCS-0537606, a Google Research Grant, a Yahoo!

Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Social and Behavioral Sciences]: Economics General Terms Economics, Theory 1. INTRODUCTION Diffusion and Networked Coordination Games. A fundamental question in the social sciences is to understand the ways in which new ideas, behaviors, and practices diffuse through populations. Such issues arise, for example, in the adoption of new technologies, the emergence of new social norms or organizational conventions, or the spread of human languages [2, 14, 15, 16, 17]. An active line of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19]. We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13], which will form the starting point for our work here. We describe it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose. Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B, which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system in order to communicate. There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability). Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity. Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B. Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead. If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.) As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets. Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q). Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality. In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS. An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B. In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual. In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both. But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each. Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves. What might we learn from such an extension? To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies. There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12]. Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6]. While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing. A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology. The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior. In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models. We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior. Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B. An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q). Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies. Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c). Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B. Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A. We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost. In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure. A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 . Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 . In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line. Our Results. We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.) In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval. In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval. This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure. It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows. When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network. Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network. When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy. Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress. Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B. In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A. But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB. Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G). For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it. However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω. Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 . On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large. Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant. Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G). In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting. With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes. We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked. The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often). Further Extensions. Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B. Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q). We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0. Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters. We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge. We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes. We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range. Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2. MODEL We now develop some further notation and definitions that will be useful for expressing the model. Recall that we have an infinite Δ-regular graph G, and strategies A, B, and AB that are used in a coordination game on each edge. For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB. The overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of the above values over all neighbors w of v, minus a cost which is 0 if v chooses A or B and c = rΔ if she chooses AB. We refer to the overall game, played by all nodes in G, as a contagion game, and denote it using the tuple (G, q, r). This game can have many Nash equilibria. In particular, the two states where everybody uses technology A or everybody uses technology B are both equilibria of this game. As discussed in the previous section, we are interested in the dynamics of reaching an equilibrium in this game; in particular, we would like to know whether it is possible to move from an all-B equilibrium to an all-A equilibrium by changing the strategy of a finite number of agents, and following a sequence of best-response moves. We provide a formal description of this question via the following two definitions. DEFINITION 2.1. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r). A state in this game is a strategy profile s : V (G) → {A, B, AB}. For two states s and s and a vertex v ∈ V (G), if starting from state s and letting v play her best-response move (breaking ties in favor of A and then AB) we get to the state s , we write s v → s . Similarly, for two states s and s and a finite sequence S = v1, v2, . . . , vk of vertices of G (where vis are not necessarily distinct), we say s S → s if there is a sequence of states s1, . . . , sk−1 such that s v1 → s1 v2 → s2 v3 → · · · sk−1 vk → s . For an infinite sequence S = v1, v2, . . . of vertices of G, we denote the subsequence v1, v2, . . . , vk by Sk. We say s S → s for two states s and s if for every vertex v ∈ V (G) there exists a k0(v) such that for every k > k0(v), s Sk → sk for a state sk with sk(v) = s (v). DEFINITION 2.2. For T ⊆ V (G), we denote by sT the strategy profile that assigns A to every agent in T and B to every agent in V (G) \\ T. We say that technology A can become an epidemic in the game (G, q, r) if there is a finite set T of nodes in G (called the seed set) and a sequence S of vertices in V (G) \\ T (where each vertex can appear more than once) such that sT S → sV (G), i.e., endowing agents in T with technology A and letting other agents play their best response according to schedule S would lead every agent to eventually adopt strategy A.2 The above definition requires that the all-A equilibrium be reachable from the initial state by at least one schedule S of best-response moves. In fact, we will show in Section 4 that if A can become an epidemic in a game, then for every schedule of best-response moves of the nodes in V (G) \\ T in which each node is scheduled an infinite number of times, eventually all nodes adopt strategy A.3 3. EXAMPLES We begin by considering some basic examples that yield epidemic regions with the kinds of non-convexity properties discussed 2 Note that in our definition we assume that agents in T are endowed with the strategy A at the beginning. Alternatively, one can define the notion of epidemic by allowing agents in T to be endowed with any combination of AB and A, or with just AB. However, the difference between these definitions is rather minor and our results carry over with little or no change to these alternative models. 3 Note that we assume agents in the seed set T cannot change their strategy. 0−1 1 2 Figure 2: The thick line graph in Section 1. We first discuss a natural Δ-regular generalization of the infinite line graph, and for this one we work out the complete analysis that describes the region Ω(G), the set of all pairs (q, r) for which the technology A can become an epidemic. We then describe, without the accompanying detailed analysis, the epidemic regions for the infinite Δ-regular tree and for the two-dimensional grid. The infinite line and the thick line graph. For a given even integer Δ, we define the thick line graph LΔ as follows: the vertex set of this graph is Z × {1, 2, . . . , Δ/2}, where Z is the set of all integers. There is an edge between vertices (x, i) and (x , i ) if and only if |x − x | = 1. For each x ∈ Z, we call the set of vertices {(x, i) : i ∈ {1, . . . , Δ/2} the xth group of vertices. Figure 2 shows a picture of L6 Now, assume that starting from a position where every node uses the strategy B, we endow all agents in a group (say, group 0) with the strategy A. Consider the decision faced by the agents in group 1, who have their right-hand neighbors using B and their left-hand neighbors using A. For these agents, the payoffs of strategies A, B, and AB are (1 − q)Δ/2, qΔ/2, and Δ/2 − rΔ, respectively. Therefore, if q ≤ 1 2 and q ≤ 2r, the best response of such an agent is A. Hence, if the above inequality holds and we let agents in groups 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . play their best response in this order, then A will become an epidemic. Also, if we have q > 2r and q ≤ 1 − 2r, the best response of an agent with her neighbors on one side playing A and neighbors on the other side playing B is the strategy AB. Therefore, if we let agents in groups 1 and −1 change to their best response, they would switch their strategy to AB. After this, agents in group 2 will see AB on their left and B on their right. For these agents (and similarly for the agents in group −2), the payoff of strategies A, B, and AB are (1−q)Δ/2, qΔ, and (q+max(q, 1−q))Δ/2− rΔ, respectively. Therefore, if max(1, 2q) − 2r ≥ 1 − q and max(1, 2q) − 2r ≥ 2q, or equivalently, if 2r ≤ q and q + r ≤ 1 2 , the best response of such an agent is AB. Hence, if the above inequality holds and we let agents in groups 2, −2, 3, −3 . . . play their best response in this order, then every agent (except for agents in group 0) switches to AB. Next, if we let agents in groups 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . change their strategy again, for q ≤ 1/2, every agent will switch to strategy A, and hence A becomes an epidemic.4 4 Strictly speaking, since we defined a schedule of moves as a single infinite sequence of vertices in V (G) \\ T, the order 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . is not a valid schedule. However, since vertices of G have finite degree, it is not hard to see that any ordering of a multiset containing any (possibly infinite) 78 1/20 r q 0 1/4 3/16 1/12 1/4 Figure 3: Epidemic regions for the infinite grid 1/20 1/Δ r q 0 1/Δ Figure 4: Epidemic regions for the infinite Δ-regular tree The above argument shows that for any combination of (q, r) parameters in the marked region in Figure 1, technology A can become an epidemic. It is not hard to see that for points outside this region, A cannot become epidemic. Further examples: trees and grids. Figures 3 and 4 show the epidemic regions for the infinite grid and the infinite Δ-regular tree. Note they also exhibit non-convexities. 4. CHARACTERIZATION In this section, we characterize equilibrium properties of contagion games. To this end, we must first argue that contagion games in fact have well-defined and stable equilibria. We then discuss some respects in which the equilibrium reached from an initial state is essentially independent of the order in which best-response updates are performed. We begin with the following lemma, which proves that agents eventually converge to a fixed strategy, and so the final state of a game is well-defined by its initial state and an infinite sequence of moves. Specifically, we prove that once an agent decides to adopt technology A, she never discards it, and once she decides to discard technology B, she never re-adopts it. Thus, after an infinite number of best-response moves, each agent converges to a single strategy. LEMMA 4.1. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r) and a (possibly infinite) subset T ⊆ V (G) of agents. Let sT be the strategy profile assigning A to every agent in T and B to every agent in V (G) \\ T. Let S = v1, v2, . . . be a (possibly infinite) sequence of number of copies of each vertex of V (G) \\ T can be turned into an equivalent schedule of moves. For example, the sequence 1, −1, 2, −2, 1, −1, 3, −3, 2, −2, . . . gives the same outcome as 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . in the thick line example. agents in V (G) \\ T and consider the sequence of states s1, s2, . . . obtained by allowing agents to play their best-response in the order defined by S (i.e., s v1 → s1 v2 → s2 v3 → · · · ). Then for every i, one of the following holds: • si(vi+1) = B and si+1(vi+1) = A, • si(vi+1) = B and si+1(vi+1) = AB, • si(vi+1) = AB and si+1(vi+1) = A, • si(vi+1) = si+1(vi+1). PROOF. Let X >k v Y indicate that agent v (weakly) prefers strategy X to strategy Y in state sk. For any k let zk A, zk B, and zk AB be the number of neighbors of v with strategies A, B, and AB in state sk, respectively. Thus, for agent v in state sk, 1. A >k v B if (1 − q)(zk A + zk AB) is greater than q(zk B + zk AB), 2. A >k v AB if (1− q)(zk A + zk AB) is greater than (1− q)zk A + qzk B + max(q, 1 − q)zk AB − Δr, 3. and AB >k v B if (1−q)zk A +qzk B +max(q, 1−q)zk AB −Δr is greater than q(zk B + zk AB). Suppose the lemma is false and consider the smallest i such that the lemma is violated. Let v = vi+1 be the agent who played her best response at time i. Thus, either 1. si(v) = A and si+1(v) = B, or 2. si(v) = A and si+1(v) = AB, or 3. si(v) = AB and si+1(v) = B. We show that in the third case, agent v could not have been playing a best response. The other cases are similar. In the third case, we have si(v) = AB and si+1(v) = B. As si(v) = AB, there must be a time j < i where sj v → sj+1 and sj+1(v) = AB. Since this was a best-response move for v, inequality 3 implies that (1 − q)zj A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj AB ≥ Δr. Furthermore, as i is the earliest time at which the lemma is violated, zi A ≥ zj A and zj AB − zi AB ≤ zi A − zj A. Thus, the change Q in payoff between AB and B (plus Δr) is Q ≡ (1 − q)zi A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zi AB ≥ (1 − q)(zi A − zj A + zj A) + max(0, 1 − 2q)(zj AB − zi A + zj A) = (1 − q)zj A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj AB + max(q, 1 − q)(zi A − zj A) ≥ (1 − q)zj A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj AB ≥ Δr, and so, by inequality 3, B can not be a better response than AB for v in state si. COROLLARY 4.2. For every infinite sequence S of vertices in V (G) \\ T, there is a unique state s such that s0 S → s, where s0 denotes the initial state where every vertex in T plays A and every vertex in V (G) \\ T plays B. Such a state s is called the outcome of the game (G, q, r) starting from T and using the schedule S. Equivalence of best-response schedules. Lemma 4.1 shows that the outcome of a game is well-defined and unique. The following theorems show that the outcome is also invariant to the dynamics, or sequence of best-response moves, under certain mild conditions. The first theorem states that if the all-A equilibrium is the outcome of a game for some (unconstrained) schedule, then it is the outcome for any schedule in which each vertex is allowed to move infinitely many times. The second theorem states that the outcome of a game is the same for any schedule of moves in which every vertex moves infinitely many times. 79 THEOREM 4.3. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r), a subset T ⊆ V (G), and a schedule S of vertices in V (G) \\ T such that the outcome of the game is the all-A equilibrium. Then for any schedule S of vertices in V (G) \\ T such that every vertex in this set occurs infinitely many times, the outcome of the game using the schedule S is also the all-A equilibrium. PROOF. Note that S is a subsequence of S . Let π : S → S be the injection mapping S to its subsequence in S . We show for any vi ∈ S, if vi switches to AB, then π(vi) switches to AB or A, and if vi switches to A, then π(vi) switches to A (here v switches to X means that after the best-response move, the strategy of v is X). Suppose not and let i be the smallest integer such that the statement doesnt hold. Let zA, zB, and zAB be the number of neighbors of vi with strategies A, B, and AB in the current state defined by S. Define zA,zB, and zAB similarly for S . Then, by Lemma 4.1 and the choice of i, zA ≥ zA, zB ≤ zB, zAB − zAB ≤ zB − zB, and zAB − zAB ≤ zA − zA. Now suppose vi switches to AB. Then the same sequence of inequalities as in Lemma 4.1 show that AB is a better response than B for π(vi) (although A might be the best response) and so π(vi) switches to either AB or A. The other case (vi switches to A) is similar. THEOREM 4.4. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r) and a subset T ⊆ V (G). Then for every two schedules S and S of vertices in V (G)\\T such that every vertex in this set occurs infinitely many times in each of these schedules, the outcomes of the game using these schedules are the same. PROOF. The proof of this theorem is similar to that of theorem 4.3 and is deferred to the full version of the paper. Blocking structures. Finally, we prove the characterization mentioned in the introduction: A cannot become epidemic if and only if (G, q, r) possesses a certain kind of blocking structure. This result generalizes Morriss theorem on the contagion threshold for his model; in his case without AB as a possible strategy, a simpler kind of community structure was the obstacle to A becoming epidemic. We begin by defining the blocking structures. DEFINITION 4.5. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r). A pair (SAB, SB) of disjoint subsets of V (G) is called a blocking structure for this game if for every vertex v ∈ SAB, degSB (v) > r q Δ, and for every vertex v ∈ SB, (1 − q) degSB (v) + min(q, 1 − q) degSAB (v) > (1 − q − r)Δ, and degSB (v) + q degSAB (v) > (1 − q)Δ, where degS(v) denotes the number of neighbors of v in the set S. THEOREM 4.6. For every contagion game (G, q, r), technology A cannot become epidemic in this game if and only if every co-finite set of vertices of G contains a blocking structure. PROOF. We first show that if every co-finite set of vertices of G contains a blocking structure, then technology A cannot become epidemic. Let T be any finite set of vertices endowed with technology A, and let (SAB, SB) be the blocking structure contained in V (G) \\ T. We claim that in the outcome of the game for any sequence S of moves, the vertices in SAB have strategy B or AB and the vertices in SB have strategy B. Suppose not and let v be the first vertex in sequence S to violate this (i.e., v ∈ SAB switches to A or v ∈ SB switches to A or AB). Suppose v ∈ SAB (the other cases are similar). Let zA, zB, and zAB denote the number of neighbors of v with strategies A, B, and AB respectively. As v is the first vertex violating the claim, zA ≤ Δ− degSB (v)− degSAB (v) and zB ≥ degSB (v). We show AB is a better strategy than A for v. To show this, we must prove that (1 − q)zA + qzB + max(q, 1 − q)zAB − Δr > (1 − q)(zA + zAB) or, equivalently, the quantity Q ≡ qzB + max(2q − 1, 0)zAB − Δr > 0: Q = (max(2q − 1, 0) − r)Δ − max(2q − 1, 0)zA +(q − max(2q − 1, 0))zB ≥ (max(2q − 1, 0) − r)Δ + min(q, 1 − q) degSB (v) − max(2q − 1, 0)(Δ − degSB (v) − degSAB (v)) ≥ [min(q, 1 − q) + max(2q − 1, 0)] degSB (v) − rΔ = q degSB (v) − rΔ > 0, where the last inequality holds by the definition of the blocking structure. We next show that A cannot become epidemic if and only if every co-finite set of vertices contains a blocking structure. To construct a blocking structure for the complement of a finite set T of vertices, endow T with strategy A and consider the outcome of the game for any sequence S which schedules each vertex an infinite number of times. Let SAB be the set of vertices with strategy AB and SB be the set of vertices with strategy B in this outcome. Note for any v ∈ SAB, AB is a best-response and so is strictly better than strategy A, i.e. q degSB (v) + max(q, 1 − q) degSAB −Δr > (1− q) degSAB (v), from where it follows that degSB (v) > (rΔ)/q. The inequalities for the vertices v ∈ SB can be derived in a similar manner. A corollary to the above theorem is that for every infinite graph G, the epidemic regions in the q-r plane for this graph is a finite union of bounded and unbounded polygons. This is because the inequalities defining blocking structures are linear inequalities in q and r, and the coefficients of these inequalities can take only finitely many values. 5. NON-EPIDEMIC REGIONS IN GENERAL GRAPHS The characterization theorem in the previous section provides one way of thinking about the region Ω(G), the set of all (q, r) pairs for which A can become epidemic in the game (G, q, r). We now consider the region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. The analysis here uses Lemma 4.1 and an argument based on an appropriately defined potential function. The first theorem shows that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω. Since q > 1 2 implies that the incumbent technology B is superior, it implies that in any network, a superior incumbent will survive for any level of compatibility. THEOREM 5.1. For every Δ-regular graph G and parameters q and r, the technology A cannot become an epidemic in the game (G, q, r) if q > 1/2. PROOF. Assume, for contradiction, that there is a Δ-regular graph G and values q > 1/2 and r, a set T of vertices of G that are initially endowed with the strategy A, and a schedule S of moves for vertices in V (G) \\ T such that this sequence leads to an all-A equilibrium. We derive a contradiction by defining a non-negative 80 potential function that starts with a finite value and showing that after each best response by some vertex the value of this function decreases by some positive amount bounded away from zero. At any state in the game, let XA,B denote the number of edges in G that have one endpoint using strategy A and the other endpoint using strategy B. Furthermore, let nAB denote the number of agents using the strategy AB. The potential function is the following: qXA,B + cnAB (recall c = Δr is the cost of adopting two technologies). Since G has bounded degree and the initial set T is finite, the initial value of this potential function is finite. We now show that every best response move decreases the value of this function by some positive amount bounded away from zero. By Lemma 4.1, we only need to analyze the effect on the potential function for moves of the sort described by the lemma. Therefore we have three cases: a node u switches from strategy B to AB, a node u switches from strategy AB to A, or a node u switches from strategy B to A. We consider the first case here; the proofs for the other cases are similar. Suppose a node u with strategy B switches to strategy AB. Let zAB, zA, and zB denote the number of neighbors of u in partition piece AB, A, and B respectively. Thus, recalling that q > 1/2, we see us payoff with strategy B is q(zAB + zB) whereas his payoff with strategy AB is q(zAB + zB) + (1 − q)zA − c. In order for this strategic change to improve us payoff, it must be the case that (1 − q)zA ≥ c. (1) Now, notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of −qzA + c as zA edges are removed from the XA,B edges between A and B and the size of partition piece AB is increased by one. This change will be negative so long as zA > c/q which holds by inequality 1 as q > (1−q) for q > 1/2. Furthermore, as zA can take only finitely many values (zA ∈ {0, 1, . . . , Δ}), this change is bounded away from zero. This next theorem shows that for any Δ, there is a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 . This means that there is a setting of the parameters q and r for which the new technology A is superior, but for which the incumbent technology is guaranteed to survive regardless of the underlying network. THEOREM 5.2. There exist q < 1/2 and r such that for every contagion game (G, q, r), A cannot become epidemic. PROOF. The proof is based on the potential function from Theorem 5.1: qXA,B + cnAB. We first show that if q is close enough to 1/2 and r is chosen appropriately, this potential function is non-increasing. Specifically, let q = 1 2 − 1 64Δ and c = rΔ = α, where α is any irrational number strictly between 3/64 and q. Again, there are three cases corresponding to the three possible strategy changes for a node u. Let zAB, zA, and zB denote the number of neighbors of node u in partition piece AB, A, and B respectively. Case 1: B → AB. Recalling that q < 1/2, we see us payoff with strategy B is q(zAB + zB) whereas his payoff with strategy AB is (1 − q)(zAB + zA) + qzB − c. In order for this strategic change to improve us payoff, it must be the case that (1 − 2q)zAB + (1 − q)zA ≥ c. (2) Now, notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of −qzA + c as zA edges are removed from the XA,B edges between A and B and the size of partition piece AB is increased by one. This change will be nonpositive so long as zA ≥ c/q. By inequality 2 and the fact that zA is an integer, zA ≥ ‰ c 1 − q − (1 − 2q)zAB 1 − q ı . Substituting our choice of parameters, (and noting that q ∈ [1/4, 1/2] and zAB ≤ Δ), we see that the term inside the ceiling is less than 1 and at least 3/64 3/4 − 1/32 1/2 > 0. Thus, the ceiling is one, which is larger than c/q. Case 2: AB → A. Recalling that q < 1/2, we see us payoff with strategy AB is (1 − q)(zAB + zA) + qzB − c whereas her payoff with strategy A is (1 − q)(zAB + zA). In order for this strategic change to improve us payoff, it must be the case that qzB ≤ c. (3) Such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of qzB −c as zB edges are added to the XA,B edges between A and B and the size of partition piece AB is decreased by one. This change will be non-positive so long as zB ≤ c/q, which holds by inequality 3. Case 3: B → A. Note us payoff with strategy B is q(zAB + zB) whereas his payoff with strategy A is (1 − q)(zAB + zA). In order for this strategic change to improve us payoff, it must be the case that (1 − 2q)zAB ≥ qzB − (1 − q)zA. (4) Such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of q(zB − zA) as zA edges are removed and zB edges are added to the XA,B edges between A and B. This change will be negative so long as zB < zA. By inequality 4 and the fact that zA is an integer, zA ≥ qzB 1 − q + (1 − 2q)zAB 1 − q . Substituting our choice of parameters, it is easy to see that the term inside the floor is at most zB + 1/4, and so the floor is at most zB as zB is an integer. We have shown the potential function is non-increasing for our choice of q and c. This implies the potential function is eventually constant. As c is irrational and the remaining terms are always rational, both nAB and XA,B must remain constant for the potential function as a whole to remain constant. Suppose A is epidemic in this region. As nAB is constant and A is epidemic, it must be that nAB = 0. Thus, the only moves involve a node u switching from strategy B to strategy A. In order for XA,B to be constant for such moves, it must be that zA (the number of neighbors of u in A) equals zB (the number of neighbors of u in B) and, as nAB = 0, we have that zA = zB = Δ/2. Thus, the payoff of u for strategy A is (1 − q)zA < Δ/4 whereas her payoff for strategy AB is (1−q)zA +qzB −c > Δ/2−q ≥ Δ/4. This contradicts the assumption that u is playing her best response by switching to A. 6. LIMITED COMPATIBILITY We now consider some further ways of modeling compatibility and interoperability. We first consider two technologies, as in the previous sections, and introduce off-diagonal payoffs to capture a positive benefit in direct A-B interactions. We find that this is 81 in fact no more general than the model with zero payoffs for A-B interactions. We then consider extensions to three technologies, identifying situations in which two coexisting incumbent technologies may or may not want to increases their mutual compatibility in the face of a new, third technology. Two technologies. A natural relaxation of the two-technology model is to introduce (small) positive payoffs for A-B interaction; that is, cross-technology communication yields some lesser value to both agents. We can model this using a variable xAB representing the payoff gathered by an agent with technology A when her neighbor has technology B, and similarly, a variable xBA representing the payoff gathered by an agent with B when her neighbor has A. Here we consider the special case in which these off-diagonal entries are symmetric, i.e., xAB = xBA = x. We also assume that x < q ≤ 1 − q. We first show that the game with off-diagonal entries is equivalent to a game without these entries, under a simple re-scaling of q and r. Note that if we re-scale all payoffs by either an additive or a multiplicative constant, the behavior of the game is unaffected. Given a game with off-diagonal entries parameterized by q, r and x, consider subtracting x from all payoffs, and scaling up by a factor of 1/(1 − 2x). As can be seen by examining Table 1, the resulting payoffs are exactly those of a game without off-diagonal entries, parameterized by q = (q − x)/(1 − 2x) and r = r/(1 − 2x). Thus the addition of symmetric off-diagonal entries does not expand the class of games being considered. Table 1 represents the payoffs in the coordination game in terms of these parameters. Nevertheless, we can still ask how the addition of an off-diagonal entry might affect the outcome of any particular game. As the following example shows, increasing compatibility between two technologies can allow one technology that was not initially epidemic to become so. EXAMPLE 6.1. Consider the contagion game played on a thick line graph (see Section 3) with r = 5/32 and q = 3/8. In this case, A is not epidemic, as can be seen by examining Figure 1, since 2r < q and q + r > 1/2. However, if we insert symmetric off-diagonal payoffs x = 1/4, we have a new game, equivalent to a game parameterized by r = 5/16 and q = 1/4. Since q < 1/2 and q < 2r , A is epidemic in this game, and thus also in the game with limited compatibility. We now show that generally, if A is the superior technology (i.e., q < 1/2), adding a compatibility term x can only help A spread. THEOREM 6.2. Let G be a game without compatibility, parameterized by r and q on a particular network. Let G be that same game, but with an added symmetric compatibility term x. If A is epidemic for G, then A is epidemic for G . PROOF. We will show that any blocking structure in G is also a blocking structure in G. By our characterization theorem, Theorem 4.6, this implies the desired result. We have that G is equivalent to a game without compatibility parameterized by q = (q − x)/(1 − 2x) and r = r/(1 − 2x). Consider a blocking structure (SB, SAB) for G . We know that for any v ∈ SAB, q dSB (v) > r Δ. Thus qdSB (v) > (q − x)dSB (v) = q (1 − 2x)dSB (v) > r (1 − 2x)Δ = rΔ, as required for a blocking structure in G. Similarly, the two blocking structure constraints for v ∈ SB are only strengthened when we move from G to G. More than two technologies. Given the complex structure inherent in contagion games with two technologies, the understanding of contagion games with three or more technologies is largely open. Here we indicate some of the technical issues that come up with multiple technologies, through a series of initial results. The basic set-up we study is one in which two incumbent technologies B and C are initially coexisting, and a third technology A, superior to both, is introduced initially at a finite set of nodes. We first present a theorem stating that for any even Δ, there is a contagion game on a Δ−regular graph in which the two incumbent technologies B and C may find it beneficial to increase their compatibility so as to prevent getting wiped out by the new superior technology A. In particular, we consider a situation in which initially, two technologies B and C with zero compatibility are at a stable state. By a stable state, we mean that no finite perturbation of the current states can lead to an epidemic for either B or C. We also have a technology A that is superior to both B and C, and can become epidemic by forcing a single node to choose A. However, by increasing their compatibility, B and C can maintain their stability and resist an epidemic from A. Let qA denote the payoffs to two adjacent nodes that both choose technology A, and define qB and qC analogously. We will assume qA > qB > qC . We also assume that r, the cost of selecting additional technologies, is sufficiently large so as to ensure that nodes never adopt more than one technology. Finally, we consider a compatibility parameter qBC that represents the payoffs to two adjacent nodes when one selects B and the other selects C. Thus our contagion game is now described by five parameters (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ). THEOREM 6.3. For any even Δ ≥ 12, there is a Δ-regular graph G, an initial state s, and values qA, qB, qC , and qBC , such that • s is an equilibrium in both (G, qA, qB, qC , 0) and (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ), • neither B nor C can become epidemic in either (G, qA, qB, qC , 0) or (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ) starting from state s, • A can become epidemic (G, qA, qB, qC , 0) starting from state s, and • A can not become epidemic in (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ) starting from state s. PROOF. (Sketch.) Given Δ, define G by starting with an infinite grid and connecting each node to its nearest Δ − 2 neighbors that are in the same row. The initial state s assigns strategy B to even rows and strategy C to odd rows. Let qA = 4k2 + 4k + 1/2, qB = 2k + 2, qC = 2k + 1, and qBC = 2k + 3/4. The first, third, and fourth claims in the theorem can be verified by checking the corresponding inequalities. The second claim follows from the first and the observation that the alternating rows contain any plausible epidemic from growing vertically. The above theorem shows that two technologies may both be able to survive the introduction of a new technology by increasing their level of compatibility with each other. As one might expect, 82 A B AB A (1 − q; 1 − q) (x; x) (1 − q; 1 − q − r) B (x; x) (q; q) (q; q − r) AB (1 − q − r; 1 − q) (q − r; q) (max(q, 1 − q) − r; max(q, 1 − q) − r) Table 1: The payoffs in the coordination game. Entry (x, y) in row i, column j indicates that the row player gets a payoff of x and the column player gets a payoff of y when the row player plays strategy i and the column player plays strategy j. there are cases when increased compatibility between two technologies helps one technology at the expense of the other. Surprisingly, however, there are also instances in which compatibility is in fact harmful to both parties; the next example considers a fixed initial configuration with technologies A, B and C that is at equilibrium when qBC = 0. However, if this compatibility term is increased sufficiently, equilibrium is lost, and A becomes epidemic. EXAMPLE 6.4. Consider the union of an infinite two-dimensional grid graph with nodes u(x, y) and an infinite line graph with nodes v(y). Add an edge between u(1, y) and v(y) for all y. For this network, we consider the initial configuration in which all v(y) nodes select A, and node u(x, y) selects B if x < 0 and selects C otherwise. We now define the parameters of this game as follows. Let qA = 3.95, qB = 1.25, qC = 1, and qBC = 0. It is easily verified that for these values, the initial configuration given above is an equilibrium. However, now suppose we increase the coordination term, setting qBC = 0.9. This is not an equilibrium, since each node of the form u(0, y) now has an incentive to switch from C (generating a payoff of 3.9) to B (thereby generating a payoff of 3.95). However, once these nodes have adopted B, the best-response for each node of the form u(1, y) is A (A generates a payoff of 4 where as B only generates a payoff of 3.95). From here, it is not hard to show that A spreads directly throughout the entire network. 7. REFERENCES [1] L. Blume. The statistical mechanics of strategic interaction.

Hay una variedad de razones por las cuales este fenómeno ocurre, muchas de las cuales, basadas en consideraciones legales, sociales o comerciales, parecen desafiar los modelos matemáticos concisos. A pesar de esto, mostramos que las ventajas de compatibilidad limitada pueden surgir en un modelo de difusión muy simple en las redes sociales, ofreciendo así una explicación básica para este fenómeno en términos puramente estratégicos. Nuestro enfoque se basa en el trabajo sobre la difusión de las innovaciones en la literatura económica, que busca modelar cómo una nueva tecnología podría extenderse a través de una red social de personas que actualmente son usuarios de tecnología B. Consideramos varias formas de capturar la compatibilidad de A y B, centrándose principalmente en un modelo en el que los usuarios pueden optar por adoptar A, adoptar B o, a un costo adicional, adoptar A y B. Caracterizamos cómo la capacidad de A para propagarse depende de su calidad en relación con B, y también de este costo adicional de adoptar ambos, y encontrar algunas propiedades sorprendentes que no son de no monotonicidad en la dependencia de estos parámetros: en algunos casos, para una tecnología aSobrevivir a la introducción de otro, el costo de adoptar ambas tecnologías debe equilibrarse dentro de un rango estrecho e intermedio.

Categorías y descriptores de sujetos J.4 [Ciencias sociales y conductuales]: Economía Términos generales Economía, Teoría 1. Introducción Difusión y juegos de coordinación en red. Una pregunta fundamental en las ciencias sociales es comprender las formas en que las nuevas ideas, comportamientos y prácticas se difunden a través de las poblaciones. Tales problemas surgen, por ejemplo, en la adopción de nuevas tecnologías, el surgimiento de nuevas normas sociales u convenciones organizacionales, o la difusión de los idiomas humanos [2, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Una línea activa de investigación en economía y sociología matemática se refiere a modelar este tipo de procesos de difusión como un juego de coordinación jugado en una red social [1, 5, 7, 13, 19]. Comenzamos discutiendo uno de los modelos de difusión teóricos de juego más básicos, propuestos en un artículo influyente de Morris [13], que formará el punto de partida para nuestro trabajo aquí. Lo describimos en términos del siguiente escenario de adopción de tecnología, aunque hay muchos otros ejemplos que tendrían el mismo propósito. Supongamos que hay dos sistemas de mensajería instantánea (IM) A y B, que no son interoperables: los usuarios deben estar en el mismo sistema para comunicarse. Hay una red social G en los usuarios, que indica quién quiere hablar con quién y los puntos finales de cada borde (v, w) juegan un juego de coordinación con posibles estrategias A o B: si v y w cada uno elige el sistema IM B,Luego, cada uno recibe una recompensa de Q (ya que pueden hablar entre sí usando el Sistema B);Si cada uno elige el sistema IM A, entonces cada uno recibe una recompensa de 1 - Q;Y si eligen sistemas opuestos, cada uno recibe una recompensa de 0 (que refleja la falta de interoperabilidad). Tenga en cuenta que A es la mejor tecnología si Q <1 2, en el sentido de que los pagos A-A excederían los pagos de B-B, mientras que A es la peor tecnología si Q> 1 2.75 Se pueden derivar una serie de ideas cualitativas de un modelo de difusión incluso a este nivel de simplicidad. Específicamente, considere una red G y deje que todos los nodos inicialmente jueguen B. Ahora suponga que un pequeño número de nodos comienza a adoptar la estrategia A en su lugar. Si aplicamos actualizaciones de la mejor respuesta a los nodos en la red, entonces los nodos en efecto aplicarán repetidamente la siguiente regla simple: cambie a un si es suficiente de los vecinos de su red ya han adoptado A. (por ejemplo, comienza a usar un sistema IM particular -o sitio de redes sociales, o formato de documento electrónico: si suficientes de sus amigos son usuarios de ello). A medida que se desarrolla, puede haber una secuencia en cascada de nodos que cambian a A, de modo que se alcanza un equilibrio en toda la red en el límite: este equilibrio puede implicar uniformidad, con todos los nodos que adoptan A;o puede involucrar la coexistencia, con los nodos divididos en un conjunto que adopta A y un conjunto que adopta B, y los bordes producen cero pago que conecta los dos conjuntos. Morris [13] proporciona un conjunto de elegantes caracterizaciones teóricas gráficas para cuando surgen estos tipos de equilibrio cualitativamente diferentes, en términos de la topología de la red subyacente y la calidad de A en relación con B (es decir, los tamaños relativos de 1-Q y Q). Compatibilidad, interoperabilidad y bilingüidad. En la mayoría de los entornos que forman la motivación para los modelos de difusión, la coexistencia (sin embargo desequilibrada) es el resultado típico: por ejemplo, los idiomas humanos y las convenciones sociales coexisten a lo largo de los límites geográficos;Es un resultado estable para que la industria financiera use Windows, mientras que la industria del entretenimiento utiliza Mac OS. Sin embargo, una pieza importante que podría faltar en los modelos de difusión teóricos básicos del juego es una imagen más detallada de lo que está sucediendo en el límite de coexistencia, donde la forma básica del modelo plantea nodos que adoptan un vinculado a los nodos que adoptanB. En estos entornos motivadores para los modelos, por supuesto, uno a menudo ve regiones de interfaz en las que los individuos se vuelven bilingües. En el caso de la difusión del lenguaje humano, esta bilingüidad se entiende literalmente: regiones geográficas donde hay una interacción sustancial con los hablantes de dos idiomas diferentes tienden a tener habitantes que hablan ambos. Pero la bilingüe también es una característica esencial de la interacción tecnológica: al final, muchas personas tienen cuentas en múltiples sistemas IM, por ejemplo, y en general, muchos mantienen la capacidad de trabajar dentro de múltiples sistemas informáticos para colaborar con personas integradas en cada una. Tomando este punto de vista, es natural preguntar cómo se comportan los modelos de difusión cuando se extienden para que ciertos nodos puedan ser bilingües en este sentido general, adoptando ambas estrategias a algún costo para sí mismos. ¿Qué podríamos aprender de tal extensión? Para empezar, tiene el potencial de proporcionar una perspectiva valiosa sobre la cuestión de la compatibilidad e incompatibilidad que sustenta la competencia entre las empresas de tecnología. Existe una gran literatura sobre cómo la compatibilidad entre las tecnologías afecta la competencia entre las empresas, y en particular cómo la incompatibilidad puede ser una decisión estratégica beneficiosa para ciertos participantes en un mercado [3, 4, 8, 9, 12]. Whinston [18] proporciona una taxonomía interesante de diferentes tipos de incompatibilidad estratégica;y recientemente se han llevado a cabo estudios específicos de casos de la industria (incluidas las perspectivas teóricas) para los bancos comerciales [10], la tecnología de copia e imágenes [11] y los sistemas de mensajeros instantáneos [6]. Si bien estos modelos existentes de efectos de la red de captura de compatibilidad en el sentido de que los usuarios en el mercado prefieren usar tecnología que esté más extendido, no capturan el fenómeno de red de grano más fino representado por la difusión: que cada usuario incluye su vista local en eldecisión, basada en lo que están haciendo sus propios vecinos de redes sociales. Un modelo de difusión que incorporó tales extensiones podría proporcionar información sobre la estructura de los límites en la red entre tecnologías;Potencialmente podría ofrecer una base teórica gráfica de cómo la incompatibilidad puede beneficiar a una tecnología existente, fortaleciendo estos límites y evitando la incursión de una nueva tecnología nueva. El presente trabajo: difusión con el comportamiento bilingüe. En este artículo, desarrollamos un conjunto de modelos de difusión que incorporan nociones de compatibilidad y bilingüidad, y encontramos que surgen algunos fenómenos inesperados incluso de versiones muy simples de los modelos. Comenzamos quizás con la forma más simple de extender el modelo Morriss discutido anteriormente para incorporar el comportamiento bilingüe. Considere nuevamente el ejemplo de los sistemas IM A y B, con la estructura de pago como antes, pero ahora suponga que cada nodo puede adoptar una tercera estrategia, denotó AB, en la que decide usar A y B. Un adoptante de AB puede usar, en un borde por borde, el que de A o B produce pagos más altos en cada interacción, y la estructura de pago se define de acuerdo con este principio: si un adoptante de AB interactúa con un adoptante deB, ambos reciben Q;Con un adoptante de A, ambos reciben 1 - Q;y con otro adoptante de AB, ambos reciben Max (Q, 1 - Q). Finalmente, un adoptante de AB paga una multa de costo fijo de C (es decir, −C se agrega a su recompensa total) para representar el costo de tener que mantener ambas tecnologías. Por lo tanto, en este modelo, hay dos parámetros que pueden variarse: las cualidades relativas de las dos tecnologías (codificadas por Q) y el costo de ser bilingüe, lo que refleja un tipo de incompatibilidad (codificado por C). Siguiendo [13] asumimos que el gráfico subyacente G es infinito;Además, suponemos que para algún número natural δ, cada nodo tiene grado δ.1, estamos interesados en la pregunta planteada desde el principio, de si una nueva tecnología A puede extenderse a través de una red donde casi todos usan inicialmente B. Formalmente, decimos que la estrategia A puede convertirse en epidemia si se mantiene lo siguiente: comenzando desde un estado en el que todos los nodos en un conjunto finito S adopten A, y todos los demás nodos adoptan B, una secuencia de actualizaciones de la mejor respuesta (potencialmente con un toque de TIE)En G - S hace que cada nodo eventualmente adopte A. También presentamos un poco de notación adicional que será útil en las secciones posteriores: definimos r = c/δ, la penalización fija por adoptar AB, escalado para que sea un costo por borde. En el modelo Morris, donde las únicas opciones estratégicas son A y B, un parámetro clave es el umbral de contagio de G, denotado Q ∗ (g): este es el supremum de Q para el cual A puede convertirse en epidémico en G con el parámetro Q enla estructura de pago. Un resultado central de [13] es que 1 2 es el umbral de contagio máximo posible para cualquier gráfico: Supg Q ∗ (g) = 1 2. De hecho, existen gráficos en los que el umbral de contagio es tan grande como 1 2 (incluida la línea infinita, la gráfica de 2 -regular conectada infinita única);Por otro lado, uno puede demostrar que no hay gráfico con un umbral de contagio superior a 1 2. En nuestro modelo donde es posible la estrategia bilingüe AB, tenemos un espacio de parámetros bidimensionales, por lo que en lugar de un umbral de contagio Q ∗ (g) tenemos una región epidémica ω (g), que es el subconjunto de (Q,r) plano para el cual a puede convertirse en epidemia en G. y en lugar del umbral de contagio máximo posible supg q ∗ (g), debemos considerar la región epidémica general ω = ∪gΩ (g), donde la unión se toma sobre todasgráficos infinitos δ-regulares;Este es el conjunto de todos los valores (Q, R) para los cuales A puede convertirse en epidemia en alguna red δ-regular.1 Podemos obtener resultados estrictamente análogos tomando una secuencia de gráficos finitos y expresando resultados asintóticamente, pero el uso de un gráfico de grado límite infinito G hace que sea conceptualmente mucho más limpio expresar los resultados (como lo hace en el papel Morriss [13]): Se necesita cuantificación menos intrincada para expresar las propiedades de difusión, y los fenómenos cualitativos siguen siendo los mismos.76 1/20 1 R Q 0 1/2 1 Figura 1: La región del plano (q, r) para el cual la tecnología A puede convertirse en epidemia en la línea infinita. Nuestros resultados. Encontramos, en primer lugar, que la región epidémica Ω (g) puede ser inesperadamente compleja, incluso para gráficos muy simples, G. La Figura 1 muestra la región epidémica para la línea infinita;Uno observa que ni la región ω (g) ni su complemento son convexos en el cuadrante positivo, debido a la forma de corte triangular.(Encontramos formas análogas que se vuelven aún más complejas para otras estructuras de gráficos infinitos simples; ver, por ejemplo, las Figuras 3 y 4.) En particular, esto significa que para valores de Q cercanos a menos de 1 2, la estrategia A puede convertirse en epidemia en la línea infinita si R es suficientemente pequeña o suficientemente grande, pero no si R toma valores en algún intervalo intermedio. En otras palabras, la estrategia B (que representa la peor tecnología, ya que Q <1 2) sobrevivirá si y solo si el costo de ser bilingüe se calibra para estar en este intervalo medio. Esto es un reflejo de una compatibilidad limitada, que puede ser interesado de una tecnología titular para que sea difícil, pero no demasiado difícil, usar una nueva tecnología, y nos sorprende que surja de un modelo básico en un simpleestructura de red. Es natural preguntar si existe una interpretación cualitativa de cómo surge esto del modelo, y de hecho no es difícil dar tal interpretación, como sigue. Cuando R es muy pequeño, es barato que los nodos adopten AB como estrategia, por lo que AB se extiende por toda la red. Una vez que AB está en todas partes, las actualizaciones de la mejor respuesta hacen que todos los nodos cambien a A, ya que obtienen los mismos beneficios de interacción sin pagar la multa de R.Cuando R es muy grande, los nodos en la interfaz, con uno vecino y otro vecino B, encontrarán demasiado costoso elegir AB, por lo que elegirán una (la mejor tecnología) y, por lo tanto, A se extenderá paso a pasoa través de la red. Cuando R toma un valor intermedio, un nodo V en la interfaz, con uno vecino y uno vecino B, encontrará más beneficioso adoptar AB como estrategia. Una vez que esto suceda, el vecino de V que está jugando B no tendrá suficiente incentivo para cambiar, y las actualizaciones de mejor respuesta no avanzan más. Por lo tanto, este valor intermedio de R permite que se forme un límite de AB entre los adoptantes de A y los adoptantes de B. En resumen, la situación que enfrenta B es esta: si es demasiado permisiva, AB lo invade seguido de A;Si es demasiado inflexible, obligando a los nodos a elegir solo uno de A o B, es destruida por una cascada de conversiones directas a A. Pero si tiene el equilibrio correcto en el valor de R, entonces las adopciones de A se detienen en un límite bilingüe donde los nodos adoptan AB. Moviéndose más allá de los gráficos específicos G, encontramos que esta no convexidad también se mantiene en un sentido mucho más general, considerando la región epidemia general ω = ∪gω (g). Para cualquier valor dado de δ, la región Ω es una unión complicada de polígonos limitados y ilimitados, y no tenemos una descripción simple de forma cerrada para ello. Sin embargo, podemos mostrar a través de un posible argumento de la función que no hay punto (Q, R) con Q> 1 2 pertenece a Ω. Además, podemos mostrar la existencia de un punto (q, r) ∈ Ω para el cual q <1 2. Por otro lado, la consideración de la región epidémica para la línea infinita muestra que (1 2, r) ∈ ω para r = 0 y para R suficientemente grande. Por lo tanto, ni Ω ni su complemento son convexos en el cuadrante positivo. Finalmente, también extendemos una caracterización que Morris dio para el umbral de contagio [13], produciendo una caracterización algo más intrincada de la región ω (g). En el entorno de Morriss, sin una estrategia AB, demostró que A no puede convertirse en epidemia con el parámetro Q si y solo si cada conjunto de nodos de cofinita contiene un subconjunto S que funciona como una comunidad bien conectada: cada nodo en S tiene al menos un ((1-q) La fracción de sus vecinos en S. En otras palabras, las comunidades muy unidas son los obstáculos naturales para la difusión en su entorno. Con la estrategia AB como una opción adicional, una estructura más compleja se convierte en el obstáculo: mostramos que A no puede convertirse en epidemia con los parámetros (Q, R) si y solo si cada conjunto de cofinita contiene una estructura que consiste en una comunidad muy unida con unparticular tipo de interfaz de nodos vecinos. Mostramos que dicha estructura permite que los nodos adopten AB en la interfaz y B dentro de la comunidad misma, evitando la propagación de A;Y por el contrario, esta es la única forma de bloquear la propagación de A. El análisis subyacente al teorema de caracterización produce una serie de otras consecuencias;Una básica es, más o menos, que el resultado de las actualizaciones de la mejor respuesta es independiente del orden en que se secuencian las actualizaciones (siempre que cada nodo intente actualizarse infinitamente a menudo). Otras extensiones. Otra forma de modelar la compatibilidad y la interoperabilidad en los modelos de difusión es a través de los términos fuera de la diagonal que representan el pago de las interacciones entre un nodo que adopta A y un nodo que adopta B. En lugar de configurarlos en 0, podemos considerar establecerlos en un valor x ≤ min (Q, 1 - Q). Encontramos que para el caso de dos tecnologías, el modelo no se vuelve más general, ya que cualquier instancia de este tipo es equivalente, mediante una redescalización de Q y R, a una donde x = 0. Además, utilizando nuestra caracterización de la región ω (g) en términos de comunidades e interfaces, mostramos un resultado monotonicty: si A puede convertirse en epidemia en un gráfico G con parámetros (Q, R, X), y luego X aumenta,Entonces A todavía puede convertirse en epidemia con los nuevos parámetros. También consideramos el efecto de estos términos fuera de la diagonal en una extensión a las tecnologías competidoras K> 2;Para las tecnologías X e Y, deje que Qx denote el pago de una interacción X-X en un borde y Qxy denota el pago de una interacción X-Y en un borde. Consideramos una configuración en la que dos tecnologías B y C, que inicialmente coexisten con QBC = 0, enfrentan la introducción de una tercera tecnología A en un conjunto finito de nodos. Mostramos un ejemplo en el que B y C sobreviven en equilibrio si establecen QBC en un rango particular de valores, pero no si establecen QBC demasiado bajo o demasiado alto para mentir en este rango. Por lo tanto, incluso en un modelo de difusión básica con tres tecnologías, uno encuentra casos en los que dos empresas tienen un incentivo para adoptar una alianza estratégica limitada, aumentando parcialmente su interoperabilidad para defenderse de un nuevo participante en el mercado.2. Modelo ahora desarrollamos una notación y definiciones adicionales que serán útiles para expresar el modelo. Recuerde que tenemos un gráfico infinito δ-regular G, y estrategias A, B y AB que se usan en un juego de coordinación en cada borde. Para Edge (V, W), el pago 77 a cada punto final es 0 si uno de los dos nodos elige la Estrategia A y el otro elige la Estrategia B;1 - Q si uno elige la estrategia A y el otro elige A o AB;P si uno elige la estrategia B y el otro elige B o AB;y Max (Q, 1 - Q) si ambos eligen la estrategia AB. La recompensa general de un agente V es la suma de los valores anteriores sobre todos los vecinos W de V, menos un costo que es 0 si V elige A o B y C = Rδ si ella elige AB. Nos referimos al juego general, jugado por todos los nodos en G, como un juego de contagio, y lo denotamos usando la tupla (G, Q, R). Este juego puede tener muchos equilibrios de Nash. En particular, los dos estados donde todos usan la tecnología A o todos usan la tecnología B son equilibrios de este juego. Como se discutió en la sección anterior, estamos interesados en la dinámica de alcanzar un equilibrio en este juego;En particular, nos gustaría saber si es posible pasar de un equilibrio All-B a un equilibrio All-A al cambiar la estrategia de un número finito de agentes y después de una secuencia de movimientos de mejor respuesta. Proporcionamos una descripción formal de esta pregunta a través de las siguientes dos definiciones. Definición 2.1. Considere un juego de contagio (G, Q, R). Un estado en este juego es un perfil de estrategia s: v (g) → {a, b, ab}. Para dos estados S y S y un vértice v ∈ V (g), si comienzan desde el estado S y dejan que V juegue su mejor movimiento de respuesta (rompiendo lazos a favor de A y luego AB) llegamos al estado S, escribimosS V → S. Del mismo modo, para dos estados S y S y una secuencia finita S = V1, V2 ,..., VK de vértices de G (donde VIS no es necesariamente distinto), decimos S → S si hay una secuencia de estados S1 ,..., SK - 1 tal que S V1 → S1 V2 → S2 V3 → · · · SK - 1 VK → S. Para una secuencia infinita S = V1, V2 ,...de los vértices de G, denotamos la subsecuencia V1, V2 ,..., VK por SK. Decimos s → s para dos estados sy s si por cada vértice v ∈ V (g) existe un k0 (v) de modo que por cada k> k0 (v), s sk → sk para un sk sk con sk(v) = S (v). Definición 2.2. Para T ⊆ V (g), denotamos por ST el perfil de estrategia que asigna A a cada agente de T y B a cada agente de V (G) \\ T. Decimos que la tecnología A puede convertirse en una epidemia en el juego (g, q, r) Si hay un conjunto finito T de nodos en g (llamado conjunto de semillas) y una secuencia S de vértices en V (g) \\ t (donde cada vértice puede aparecer más de una vez) tal que St S →SV (g), es decir, endogar a los agentes en T con la tecnología A y permitir que otros agentes jueguen su mejor respuesta de acuerdo con el Anexo S llevaría a cada agente a adoptar la estrategia A.2 La definición anterior requiere que el equilibrio de todo el All-A sea accesibleEl estado inicial por al menos un Anexo S de los movimientos de mejor respuesta. De hecho, mostraremos en la Sección 4 que si A puede convertirse en una epidemia en un juego, entonces para cada horario de los movimientos de mejor respuesta de los nodos en V (g) \\ t en el que cada nodo está programado para un número infinito de veces, eventualmente todos los nodos adoptan la estrategia A.3 3. Ejemplos Comenzamos considerando algunos ejemplos básicos que producen regiones epidémicas con los tipos de propiedades sin convexidad discutidas 2 Tenga en cuenta que en nuestra definición suponemos que los agentes en T están dotados de la estrategia A al principio. Alternativamente, se puede definir la noción de epidemia al permitir que los agentes en T estén dotados de cualquier combinación de AB y A, o solo AB. Sin embargo, la diferencia entre estas definiciones es bastante menor y nuestros resultados se trasladan con poco o ningún cambio en estos modelos alternativos.3 Tenga en cuenta que asumimos que los agentes en el conjunto de semillas T no pueden cambiar su estrategia.0−1 1 2 Figura 2: El gráfico de línea gruesa en la Sección 1. Primero discutimos una generalización natural δ-regular del gráfico de línea infinita, y para este resolvemos el análisis completo que describe la región Ω (g), el conjunto de todos los pares (Q, R) para los cuales la tecnología puedeconvertirse en una epidemia. Luego describimos, sin el análisis detallado acompañante, las regiones epidémicas para el árbol δ-regular infinito y para la cuadrícula bidimensional. La línea infinita y el gráfico de la línea gruesa. Para un entero δ dado, definimos el gráfico de línea gruesa Lδ como sigue: el conjunto de vértice de este gráfico es Z × {1, 2 ,..., Δ/2}, donde z es el conjunto de todos los enteros. Hay un borde entre los vértices (x, i) y (x, i) si y solo si | x - x |= 1. Para cada x ∈ Z, llamamos el conjunto de vértices {(x, i): i ∈ {1 ,..., Δ/2} El grupo XTH de vértices. La Figura 2 muestra una imagen de L6 ahora, suponga que a partir de una posición donde cada nodo usa la Estrategia B, dotamos a todos los agentes en un grupo (digamos, Grupo 0) con la Estrategia A. Considere la decisión que enfrentan los agentes en el Grupo 1, que tienen a sus vecinos a la derecha usando B y sus vecinos de la izquierda usando A. Para estos agentes, los pagos de las estrategias A, B y AB son (1 - Q) δ/2, Qδ/2 y δ/2 - Rδ, respectivamente. Por lo tanto, si q ≤ 1 2 y Q ≤ 2r, la mejor respuesta de dicho agente es A. Por lo tanto, si la desigualdad anterior se mantiene y dejamos que los agentes en los grupos 1, −1, 2, −2 ,...Juega su mejor respuesta en este orden, luego se convertirá en una epidemia. Además, si tenemos Q> 2R y Q ≤ 1 - 2R, la mejor respuesta de un agente con sus vecinos en un lado jugando A y los vecinos del otro lado B Jugar B es la estrategia AB. Por lo tanto, si dejamos que los agentes en los Grupos 1 y -1 cambien a su mejor respuesta, cambiarían su estrategia a AB. Después de esto, los agentes del Grupo 2 verán a AB a su izquierda y B a su derecha. Para estos agentes (y de manera similar para los agentes en el Grupo −2), la recompensa de las estrategias A, B y AB son (1 - Q) δ/2, Qδ y (Q+Max (Q, 1 - Q))Δ/2− rδ, respectivamente. Por lo tanto, si max (1, 2q) - 2r ≥ 1 - q y max (1, 2q) - 2r ≥ 2q, o de manera equivalente, si 2r ≤ q y q + r ≤ 1 2, la mejor respuesta de dicho agente esAb. Por lo tanto, si la desigualdad anterior se mantiene y dejamos que los agentes en los grupos 2, −2, 3, -3...Juega su mejor respuesta en este orden, luego cada agente (a excepción de los agentes en el Grupo 0) cambia a AB. A continuación, si dejamos que los agentes en los grupos 1, −1, 2, −2 ,...Cambie su estrategia nuevamente, para Q ≤ 1/2, cada agente cambiará a la estrategia A, y por lo tanto A se convierte en una epidemia.4 4 estrictamente hablando, ya que definimos un horario de movimientos como una secuencia infinita de vértices en V (g (g) \\ T, el orden 1, −1, 2, −2 ,..., 1, −1, 2, −2 ,...no es un horario válido. Sin embargo, dado que los vértices de G tienen un grado finito, no es difícil ver que cualquier orden de un Multiset que contenga (posiblemente infinito) 78 1/20 R Q 0 1/4 3/16 1/12 1/4 Figura 3: EpidemiaRegiones para la cuadrícula infinita 1/20 1/Δ R Q 0 1/δ Figura 4: Regiones epidémicas para el árbol δ-regular infinito El argumento anterior muestra que para cualquier combinación de parámetros (Q, R) en la región marcada en la Figura 1, la tecnología A puede convertirse en una epidemia. No es difícil ver que para puntos fuera de esta región, no se puede convertir en epidemia. Otros ejemplos: árboles y cuadrículas. Las figuras 3 y 4 muestran las regiones epidémicas para la cuadrícula infinita y el árbol δ-regular infinito. Tenga en cuenta que también exhiben no convexidades.4. Caracterización En esta sección, caracterizamos las propiedades de equilibrio de los juegos de contagio. Con este fin, primero debemos argumentar que los juegos de contagio de hecho tienen equilibrios bien definidos y estables. Luego discutimos algunos aspectos en los que el equilibrio alcanzado desde un estado inicial es esencialmente independiente del orden en el que se realizan actualizaciones de mejor respuesta. Comenzamos con el siguiente lema, lo que demuestra que los agentes eventualmente convergen a una estrategia fija, por lo que el estado final de un juego está bien definido por su estado inicial y una secuencia infinita de movimientos. Específicamente, demostramos que una vez que un agente decide adoptar la tecnología A, nunca la descarta, y una vez que decide descartar la tecnología B, nunca la rearca. Por lo tanto, después de un número infinito de movimientos de mejor respuesta, cada agente converge a una sola estrategia. Lema 4.1. Considere un juego de contagio (G, Q, R) y un subconjunto (posiblemente infinito) T ⊆ V (G) de los agentes. Sea ST el perfil de estrategia que asigna A a cada agente en T y B a cada agente en V (G) \\ T. Sea S = V1, V2 ,...ser una secuencia (posiblemente infinita) de número de copias de cada vértice de V (g) \\ t se puede convertir en un horario equivalente de movimientos. Por ejemplo, la secuencia 1, −1, 2, −2, 1, −1, 3, −3, 2, −2 ,...Da el mismo resultado que 1, −1, 2, −2 ,..., 1, −1, 2, −2 ,...En el ejemplo de la línea gruesa.Agentes en V (g) \\ t y consideran la secuencia de los estados S1, S2 ,...obtenido al permitir que los agentes jueguen su mejor respuesta en el orden definido por S (es decir, S V1 → S1 V2 → S2 V3 → · · ·). Luego, por cada i, una de las siguientes opciones: • Si (VI+1) = B y Si+1 (VI+1) = A, • Si (VI+1) = B y Si+1 (VI+1)= AB, • Si (VI+1) = AB y Si+1 (VI+1) = A, • Si (VI+1) = Si+1 (VI+1). PRUEBA. Deje que x> k v y indique que el agente V (débil) prefiere la estrategia X a la estrategia Y en el sk estatal. Para cualquier K, deje que ZK A, ZK B y ZK AB sean el número de vecinos de V con las estrategias A, B y AB en el estado SK, respectivamente. Por lo tanto, para el Agente V en el estado SK, 1. A> K V B if (1 - Q) (Zk A + Zk AB) es mayor que Q (Zk B + Zk AB), 2. A> k v ab if (1− q) (zk a + zk ab) es mayor que (1− q) zk a + qzk b + max (q, 1 - q) zk ab - Δr, 3. y ab> k vB if (1 - Q) Zk A +QZK B +Max (Q, 1 - Q) Zk AB −ΔR es mayor que Q (Zk B +Zk AB). Supongamos que el lema es falso y considera lo más pequeño en que se viola el lema. Deje que V = VI+1 sea el agente que jugó su mejor respuesta en el momento i. Por lo tanto, 1. Si (V) = A y Si+1 (V) = B, o 2. Si (V) = A y Si+1 (V) = AB, o 3. Si (V) = AB ySi+1 (V) = B. Mostramos que en el tercer caso, el Agente V no podría haber jugado una mejor respuesta. Los otros casos son similares. En el tercer caso, tenemos Si (V) = AB y Si+1 (V) = B. Como si (v) = ab, debe haber un tiempo j <i donde sj v → sj+1 y sj+1 (v) = ab. Dado que este fue un movimiento de mejor respuesta para V, la desigualdad 3 implica que (1-q) zj a + max (0, 1-2q) zj ab ≥ Δr. Además, como yo es el primer momento en el que se viola el lema, zi a ≥ zj a y zj ab - zi ab ≤ zi a - zj A. Por lo tanto, el cambio Q en la recompensa entre AB y B (más ΔR) es Q ≡ (1 - Q) Zi A + Max (0, 1 - 2q) Zi AB ≥ (1 - Q) (Zi A - Zj A + ZJA) + max (0, 1 - 2q) (zj ab - zi a + zj a) = (1 - q) zj a + max (0, 1 - 2q) zj ab + max (q, 1 - q) (zi a - zj a) ≥ (1 - q) zj a + max (0, 1 - 2q) zj ab ≥ Δr, y por lo tanto, por la desigualdad 3, b no puede ser una mejor respuesta que AB para V en el estado Si. Corolario 4.2. Para cada secuencia infinita de vértices en V (g) \\ t, hay un estado único tal que S0 S → S, donde S0 denota el estado inicial donde cada vértice en t juega A y cada vértice en V (g) \\ \\T juega B. Tal estado S se llama el resultado del juego (G, Q, R) a partir de T y utilizando el Anexo S. La equivalencia de los horarios de la mejor respuesta. Lemma 4.1 muestra que el resultado de un juego está bien definido y único. Los siguientes teoremas muestran que el resultado también es invariante a la dinámica, o la secuencia de movimientos de mejor respuesta, bajo ciertas condiciones leves. El primer teorema establece que si el equilibrio All-A es el resultado de un juego para algún horario (sin restricciones), entonces es el resultado de cualquier horario en el que cada vértice pueda moverse infinitamente muchas veces. El segundo teorema establece que el resultado de un juego es el mismo para cualquier horario de movimientos en el que cada vértice se mueva infinitamente muchas veces.79 Teorema 4.3. Considere un juego de contagio (G, Q, R), un subconjunto T ⊆ V (G) y un Anexo S de Vértices en V (G) de modo que el resultado del juego sea el equilibrio All-A. Luego, para cualquier horario de vértices en v (g) de modo que cada vértice en este conjunto ocurra infinitamente muchas veces, el resultado del juego usando el Anexo S también es el equilibrio All-A. PRUEBA. Tenga en cuenta que S es una subsecuencia de s. Sea π: s → s el mapeo de inyección s a su subsecuencia en s. Mostramos para cualquier vi ∈ S, si Vi cambia a AB, entonces π (VI) cambia a AB o A, y si VI cambia a A, entonces π (VI) cambia a A (aquí V cambia a X significa que después de que elMovimiento de mejor respuesta, la estrategia de V es x). Supongamos que no y que yo sea el entero más pequeño de modo que la declaración no se mantenga. Deje que Za, Zb y Zab sean el número de vecinos de VI con las estrategias A, B y AB en el estado actual definido por S. Define ZA, ZB y ZAB de manera similar para S. Luego, por Lema 4.1 y la elección de I, Za ≥ Za, ZB ≤ Zb, Zab - Zab ≤ Zb - Zb y Zab - Zab ≤ Za - Za. Ahora suponga que VI cambia a AB. Entonces, la misma secuencia de desigualdades que en Lemma 4.1 muestra que AB es una mejor respuesta que B para π (VI) (aunque A podría ser la mejor respuesta) y, por lo tanto, π (VI) cambia a AB o A. El otro caso (VI cambia a A) es similar. Teorema 4.4. Considere un juego de contagio (G, Q, R) y un subconjunto T ⊆ V (G). Luego, para cada dos horarios de vértices en v (g) de modo que cada vértice en este conjunto ocurra infinitamente muchas veces en cada uno de estos horarios, los resultados del juego usando estos horarios son los mismos. PRUEBA. La prueba de este teorema es similar a la del Teorema 4.3 y se aplaza a la versión completa del documento. Estructuras de bloqueo. Finalmente, probamos la caracterización mencionada en la introducción: A no puede convertirse en epidemia si y solo si (G, Q, R) posee un cierto tipo de estructura de bloqueo. Este resultado generaliza el teorema de Morriss en el umbral de contagio para su modelo;En su caso sin AB como posible estrategia, un tipo de estructura comunitaria más simple era el obstáculo para convertirse en epidemia. Comenzamos definiendo las estructuras de bloqueo. Definición 4.5. Considere un juego de contagio (G, Q, R). Un par (sab, sb) de subconjuntos disjuntos de V (g) se llama estructura de bloqueo para este juego si para cada vértice v ∈ SAB, DEGSB (V)> R Q δ, y para cada vértice v ∈ Sb, (1 −q) DEGSB (V) + min (q, 1 - q) degsab (v)> (1 - q - r) δ, y deGSB (v) + q degsab (v)> (1 - q) δ, donde degs(v) denota el número de vecinos de V en el SET S. Teorema 4.6. Para cada juego de contagio (G, Q, R), la tecnología A no puede convertirse en epidemia en este juego si y solo si cada conjunto cofinito de vértices de G contiene una estructura de bloqueo. PRUEBA. Primero mostramos que si cada conjunto cofinito de vértices de G contiene una estructura de bloqueo, entonces la tecnología A no puede convertirse en epidemia. Sea t cualquier conjunto finito de vértices dotados de la tecnología A, y Sea (SAB, SB) la estructura de bloqueo contenida en V (G) \\ T. Afirmamos que en el resultado del juego para cualquier secuencia de movimientos, elLos vértices en SAB tienen la estrategia B o AB y los vértices en SB tienen la Estrategia B. Supongamos que no y deje que V sea el primer vértice en secuencia S que viole esto (es decir, v ∈ SAB cambia a A o V ∈ Sb cambia a A o AB). Supongamos que v ∈ SAB (los otros casos son similares). Deje que ZA, ZB y ZAB denoten el número de vecinos de V con las estrategias A, B y AB respectivamente. Como V es el primer vértice que viola el reclamo, ZA ≤ Δ - Degsb (V) - degsab (V) y ZB ≥ DEGSB (V). Mostramos que AB es una mejor estrategia que A para v. Para mostrar esto, debemos demostrar que (1 - Q) ZA + QZB + MAX (Q, 1 - Q) Zab - ΔR> (1 - Q) (ZA + ZAB) o, de manera equivalente, la cantidad q ≡ qzb + max (2q - 1, 0) zab - Δr> 0: q = (max (2q - 1, 0) - r) δ - max (2q - 1, 0) Za+ (q - max (2q - 1, 0)) Zb ≥ (max (2q - 1, 0) - r) Δ + min (Q, 1 - q) degsb (v) - max (2q - 1, 0)(Δ - degsb (v) - degsab (v)) ≥ [min (q, 1 - q) + max (2q - 1, 0)] degsb (v) - rδ = q degsb (v) - rδ> 0,donde la última desigualdad se mantiene por la definición de la estructura de bloqueo. A continuación, mostramos que A no puede convertirse en epidemia si y solo si cada conjunto cofinito de vértices contiene una estructura de bloqueo. Para construir una estructura de bloqueo para el complemento de un conjunto finito de vértices, doten t con la estrategia A y considere el resultado del juego para cualquier secuencia que reduzca cada vértice un número infinito de veces. Deje que SAB sea el conjunto de vértices con la estrategia AB y SB el conjunto de vértices con la Estrategia B en este resultado. Nota Para cualquier v ∈ SAB, AB es la mejor respuesta y, por lo tanto, es estrictamente mejor que la estrategia A, es decir, Q deGSB (V) + Max (Q, 1-Q) degsab −Δr> (1− Q) degsab (V), desde donde sigue ese DEGSB (V)> (rδ)/Q. Las desigualdades para los vértices v ∈ Sb pueden derivarse de manera similar. Un corolario del teorema anterior es que para cada gráfico infinito G, las regiones epidémicas en el plano Q-R para este gráfico es una unión finita de polígonos limitados y ilimitados. Esto se debe a que las desigualdades que definen las estructuras de bloqueo son desigualdades lineales en Q y R, y los coeficientes de estas desigualdades solo pueden tomar finitos valores.5. Regiones no epidémicas En General Graps El teorema de caracterización en la sección anterior proporciona una forma de pensar sobre la región ω (g), el conjunto de todos los pares (Q, R) para los cuales A puede convertirse en epidemia en el juego (G, Q, r). Ahora consideramos la región ω = ∪gω (g), donde la unión se toma sobre todos los gráficos δ-regulares infinitos;Este es el conjunto de todos los valores (Q, R) para los cuales A puede convertirse en epidemia en alguna red δ-regular. El análisis aquí utiliza Lemma 4.1 y un argumento basado en una función potencial definida apropiadamente. El primer teorema muestra que ningún punto (Q, R) con Q> 1 2 pertenece a Ω. Dado que Q> 1 2 implica que la tecnología Bitent B es superior, implica que en cualquier red, un titular superior sobrevivirá para cualquier nivel de compatibilidad. Teorema 5.1. Para cada gráfico δ-regular G y parámetros Q y R, la tecnología A no puede convertirse en una epidemia en el juego (G, Q, R) si Q> 1/2. PRUEBA. Suponga, por contradicción, que hay un gráfico δ-regular G y valores q> 1/2 y r, un conjunto de vértices de g que inicialmente se dotan con la estrategia A, y un cronograma de movimientos para vértices en V(G) \\ t tal que esta secuencia conduce a un equilibrio All-A. Derivamos una contradicción al definir una función potencial no negativa de 80 que comienza con un valor finito y mostrando que después de cada mejor respuesta por algún vértice, el valor de esta función disminuye en una cantidad positiva limitada de cero. En cualquier estado del juego, deje que Xa, B denoten el número de bordes en G que tienen un punto final utilizando la Estrategia A y el otro punto final utilizando la Estrategia B. Además, deje que NAB denote el número de agentes que usan la estrategia AB. La función potencial es la siguiente: Qxa, B + CNAB (RECRING C = ΔR es el costo de adoptar dos tecnologías). Dado que G tiene un grado limitado y el conjunto T inicial es finito, el valor inicial de esta función potencial es finito. Ahora mostramos que cada mejor movimiento de respuesta disminuye el valor de esta función en una cantidad positiva limitada de cero. Por Lemma 4.1, solo necesitamos analizar el efecto sobre la función potencial para los movimientos del tipo descrito por el lema. Por lo tanto, tenemos tres casos: un nodo U cambia de la estrategia B a AB, un nodo U cambia de la estrategia AB a A, o un nodo U cambia de la estrategia B a A. Consideramos el primer caso aquí;Las pruebas para los otros casos son similares. Supongamos que un nodo U con la estrategia B cambia a la estrategia AB. Deje que Zab, Za y Zb denoten el número de vecinos de U en Partition Piece AB, A y B respectivamente. Por lo tanto, recordando que q> 1/2, nos vemos que la recompensa con la estrategia B es Q (Zab + Zb), mientras que su recompensa con la estrategia AB es Q (Zab + Zb) + (1 - Q) ZA - C.Para que este cambio estratégico mejore la recompensa de los Estados Unidos, debe ser el caso de que (1 - q) za ≥ c.(1) Ahora, observe que un cambio estratégico por parte de U induce un cambio en la función potencial de − QZA + C, ya que los bordes ZA se eliminan de los bordes Xa, B entre A y B y el tamaño de la pieza de partición ABaumenta en uno. Este cambio será negativo siempre que ZA> C/Q se mantenga por la desigualdad 1 como Q> (1 - Q) para Q> 1/2. Además, como Za solo puede tomar finamente muchos valores (za ∈ {0, 1, ..., Δ}), este cambio está limitado de cero. El siguiente teorema muestra que para cualquier δ, hay un punto (q, r) ∈ ω para el cual q <1 2. Esto significa que hay una configuración de los parámetros Q y R para los cuales la nueva tecnología A es superior, pero para la cual se garantiza que la tecnología titular sobrevivirá independientemente de la red subyacente. Teorema 5.2. Existen Q <1/2 y R de tal manera que para cada juego de contagio (G, Q, R), A no puede convertirse en epidemia. PRUEBA. La prueba se basa en la función potencial del teorema 5.1: Qxa, B + CNAB. Primero mostramos que si Q está lo suficientemente cercano a 1/2 y R se elige adecuadamente, esta función potencial no es inflable. Específicamente, deje Q = 1 2 - 1 64Δ y C = Rδ = α, donde α es cualquier número irracional estrictamente entre 3/64 y Q. Nuevamente, hay tres casos correspondientes a los tres posibles cambios de estrategia para un nodo u. Deje que Zab, Za y Zb denoten el número de vecinos de Node U en la pieza de partición AB, A y B respectivamente. Caso 1: B → AB. Recordando que Q <1/2, nos vemos que la recompensa con la Estrategia B es Q (Zab + Zb), mientras que su recompensa con la estrategia AB es (1 - Q) (Zab + Za) + QZB - C.Para que este cambio estratégico mejore la recompensa de los Estados Unidos, debe ser el caso de que (1 - 2q) Zab + (1 - Q) ZA ≥ c.(2) Ahora, observe que un cambio estratégico por parte de U induce un cambio en la función potencial de − QZA + C, ya que los bordes ZA se eliminan de los bordes Xa, B entre A y B y el tamaño de la pieza de partición ABaumenta en uno. Este cambio será no positivo siempre que ZA ≥ C/Q. Por la desigualdad 2 y el hecho de que ZA es un entero, Za ≥ ‰ c 1 - q - (1 - 2q) zab 1 - q ı. Sustituyendo nuestra elección de parámetros (y señalando que q ∈ [1/4, 1/2] y Zab ≤ δ), vemos que el término dentro del techo es inferior a 1 y al menos 3/64 3/4 - 1/32 1/2> 0. Por lo tanto, el techo es uno, que es más grande que C/Q. Caso 2: AB → A. Recordando que Q <1/2, nos vemos recompensa con la estrategia AB es (1 - Q) (Zab + Za) + Qzb - C, mientras que su recompensa con la Estrategia A es (1 - Q) (zab + za). Para que este cambio estratégico mejore la recompensa de los Estados Unidos, debe ser el caso de que QZB ≤ c.(3) Tal cambio estratégico por parte de U induce un cambio en la función potencial de QZB −C a medida que se agregan bordes ZB a los bordes Xa, B entre A y B y el tamaño de la pieza de partición AB se reduce en uno. Este cambio será no positivo siempre que ZB ≤ C/Q, que se mantiene por la desigualdad 3. Caso 3: B → A. Tenga en cuenta que la recompensa con la Estrategia B es Q (ZAB + ZB), mientras que su recompensa con la Estrategia A es (1 - Q) (Zab + ZA). Para que este cambio estratégico mejore la recompensa de los Estados Unidos, debe ser el caso de que (1 - 2q) zab ≥ QZB - (1 - Q) ZA.(4) Un cambio estratégico por parte de U induce un cambio en la función potencial de Q (Zb - Za) a medida que se eliminan los bordes ZA y se agregan los bordes ZB a los bordes Xa, B entre A y B. Este cambio será negativo siempre que ZB <ZA. Por la desigualdad 4 y el hecho de que ZA es un entero, ZA ≥ QZB 1 - Q + (1 - 2Q) Zab 1 - Q. Sustituyendo nuestra elección de parámetros, es fácil ver que el término dentro del piso es como máximo ZB + 1/4, por lo que el piso es como máximo ZB ya que ZB es un entero. Hemos demostrado que la función potencial no aumenta para nuestra elección de Q y C.Esto implica que la función potencial es eventualmente constante. Como C es irracional y los términos restantes siempre son racionales, tanto NAB como Xa, B debe permanecer constante para que la función potencial en su conjunto permanezca constante. Supongamos que A es epidemia en esta región. Como NAB es constante y A es epidemia, debe ser que nab = 0. Por lo tanto, los únicos movimientos implican un nodo U que cambia de la estrategia B a la estrategia A. Para que Xa, b sea constante para tales movimientos, debe ser que Za (el número de vecinos de u en a) es igual a ZB (el número de vecinos de u en b) y, como nab = 0, tenemos esoza = zb = δ/2. Por lo tanto, el pago de U para la estrategia A es (1 - Q) ZA <δ/4, mientras que su recompensa para la estrategia AB es (1 - Q) ZA +QZB −C> δ/2 - Q ≥ δ/4. Esto contradice la suposición de que U está jugando su mejor respuesta al cambiar a A. 6. Compatibilidad limitada Ahora consideramos algunas formas adicionales de modelar la compatibilidad y la interoperabilidad. Primero consideramos dos tecnologías, como en las secciones anteriores, e presentamos pagos fuera de diagonales para capturar un beneficio positivo en las interacciones directas A-B. Encontramos que esto es 81 de hecho no más general que el modelo con cero pagos para interacciones A-B. Luego consideramos extensiones a tres tecnologías, identificando situaciones en las que dos tecnologías titulares coexistentes pueden o no querer aumentar su compatibilidad mutua frente a una nueva tecnología nueva. Dos tecnologías. Una relajación natural del modelo de dos tecnologías es introducir pagos positivos (pequeños) para la interacción A-B;Es decir, la comunicación de tecnología cruzada produce un valor menor para ambos agentes. Podemos modelar esto utilizando una variable XAB que representa el pago recopilado por un agente con tecnología A cuando su vecino tiene tecnología B, y de manera similar, una variable XBA que representa el pago reunido por un agente con B cuando su vecino tiene A. Aquí consideramos el caso especial en el que estas entradas fuera de diagonal son simétricas, es decir, xab = xba = x. También suponemos que x <q ≤ 1 - q. Primero mostramos que el juego con entradas fuera de diagonal es equivalente a un juego sin estas entradas, bajo una simple redescalización de Q y R.Tenga en cuenta que si volvemos a escalar todos los pagos por una constante aditiva o multiplicativa, el comportamiento del juego no se ve afectado. Dado un juego con entradas fuera de diagonal parametrizadas por Q, R y X, considere restar X de todos los pagos y ampliar por un factor de 1/(1-2x). Como se puede ver examinando la Tabla 1, los pagos resultantes son exactamente los de un juego sin entradas fuera de diagonal, parametrizadas por q = (q-x)/(1-2x) y r = r/(1-2x). Por lo tanto, la adición de entradas simétricas fuera de la diagonal no expande la clase de juegos que se están considerando. La Tabla 1 representa los pagos en el juego de coordinación en términos de estos parámetros. Sin embargo, todavía podemos preguntarnos cómo la adición de una entrada fuera de diagonal podría afectar el resultado de cualquier juego en particular. Como muestra el siguiente ejemplo, el aumento de la compatibilidad entre dos tecnologías puede permitir que una tecnología que inicialmente no era epidemia se volviera así. Ejemplo 6.1. Considere el juego de contagio jugado en un gráfico de línea gruesa (ver Sección 3) con R = 5/32 y Q = 3/8. En este caso, A no es epidemia, como se puede ver examinando la Figura 1, ya que 2R <Q y Q + R> 1/2. Sin embargo, si insertamos pagos simétricos fuera de diagonales x = 1/4, tenemos un nuevo juego, equivalente a un juego parametrizado por R = 5/16 y Q = 1/4. Desde Q <1/2 y Q <2r, A es epidemia en este juego y, por lo tanto, también en el juego con compatibilidad limitada. Ahora mostramos que, en general, si A es la tecnología superior (es decir, Q <1/2), agregar un término de compatibilidad X solo puede ayudar a una propagación. Teorema 6.2. Sea G un juego sin compatibilidad, parametrizado por R y Q en una red en particular. Sea G ese mismo juego, pero con un término de compatibilidad simétrico adicional x. Si A es epidemia para G, entonces A es epidemia para g. PRUEBA. Mostraremos que cualquier estructura de bloqueo en G también es una estructura de bloqueo en G. Mediante nuestro teorema de caracterización, Teorema 4.6, esto implica el resultado deseado. Tenemos que G es equivalente a un juego sin compatibilidad parametrizado por Q = (q - x)/(1 - 2x) y r = r/(1 - 2x). Considere una estructura de bloqueo (SB, SAB) para g. Sabemos que para cualquier v ∈ SAB, Q DSB (V)> R δ. Así qdsb (v)> (q - x) dsb (v) = q (1 - 2x) dsb (v)> r (1 - 2x) δ = rδ, como se requiere para una estructura de bloqueo en G. De manera similar, las dosLas restricciones de estructura de bloqueo para V ∈ Sb solo se fortalecen cuando nos movemos de G a G. más de dos tecnologías. Dada la compleja estructura inherente a los juegos de contagio con dos tecnologías, la comprensión de los juegos de contagio con tres o más tecnologías está en gran medida abierta. Aquí indicamos algunos de los problemas técnicos que presentan múltiples tecnologías, a través de una serie de resultados iniciales. La configuración básica que estudiamos es una en la que dos tecnologías titulares B y C inicialmente coexisten, y una tercera tecnología A, superior a ambos, se introduce inicialmente en un conjunto finito de nodos. Primero presentamos un teorema que indica que para cualquier δ incluso, hay un juego de contagio en un gráfico δ -regular en el que las dos tecnologías titulares B y C pueden encontrar beneficioso aumentar su compatibilidad para evitar que los nuevos se eliminen por los nuevosTecnología Superior A. En particular, consideramos una situación en la que inicialmente, dos tecnologías B y C con compatibilidad cero están en un estado estable. Por un estado estable, queremos decir que ninguna perturbación finita de los estados actuales puede conducir a una epidemia para B o C. También tenemos una tecnología A que es superior a B y C, y puede convertirse en epidemia forzando un solo nodopara elegir A. Sin embargo, al aumentar su compatibilidad, B y C pueden mantener su estabilidad y resistir una epidemia de A. Deje que QA denote los pagos a dos nodos adyacentes que eligen la tecnología A, y definen QB y QC análogos. Asumiremos QA> QB> QC. También suponemos que R, el costo de seleccionar tecnologías adicionales, es lo suficientemente grande como para garantizar que los nodos nunca adopten más de una tecnología. Finalmente, consideramos un parámetro de compatibilidad QBC que representa los pagos a dos nodos adyacentes cuando uno selecciona B y el otro selecciona C. Por lo tanto, nuestro juego de contagio ahora se describe con cinco parámetros (G, QA, QB, QC, QBC). Teorema 6.3. Para cualquier incluso δ ≥ 12, hay un gráfico δ-regular G, un estado inicial s y valores QA, QB, QC y QBC, de modo que • S es un equilibrio en ambos (G, Qa, Qb, Qc,0) y (G, Qa, Qb, Qc, QBC), • Ni B ni C pueden convertirse en epidemia en (G, Qa, Qb, Qc, 0) o (G, Qa, Qb, Qc, QBC) a partir de desdeEstado S, • A puede convertirse en epidemia (G, Qa, Qb, Qc, 0) a partir del estado S, y • A no puede convertirse en epidemia en (G, Qa, Qb, Qc, QBC) a partir del estado s.PRUEBA.(Bosquejo.) Dado δ, defina G comenzando con una cuadrícula infinita y conectando cada nodo a sus vecinos δ - 2 más cercanos que están en la misma fila. El estado inicial S asigna la estrategia B incluso a las filas y la estrategia C a las filas impares. Deje Qa = 4K2 + 4K + 1/2, QB = 2K + 2, QC = 2K + 1 y QBC = 2K + 3/4. La primera, tercera y cuarta afirmaciones en el teorema se pueden verificar al verificar las desigualdades correspondientes. El segundo reclamo se deduce del primero y la observación de que las filas alternos contienen cualquier epidemia plausible de crecer verticalmente. El teorema anterior muestra que dos tecnologías pueden sobrevivir a la introducción de una nueva tecnología al aumentar su nivel de compatibilidad entre sí. Como era de esperar, 82 a b ab a (1 - q; 1 - q) (x; x) (1 - q; 1 - q - r) b (x; x) (q; q) (q; q -r) ab (1 - q - r; 1 - q) (q - r; q) (max (q, 1 - q) - r; max (q, 1 - q) - r) Tabla 1: los pagos enEl juego de coordinación. Entrada (x, y) En la fila I, la columna J indica que el reproductor de fila obtiene una recompensa de X y el reproductor de columna obtiene una recompensa de Y cuando el jugador de la fila juega la estrategia I y el reproductor de columna juega la estrategia J.Hay casos en los que una mayor compatibilidad entre dos tecnologías ayuda a una tecnología a expensas de la otra. Sorprendentemente, sin embargo, también hay casos en los que la compatibilidad es de hecho perjudicial para ambas partes;El siguiente ejemplo considera una configuración inicial fija con las tecnologías A, B y C que están en equilibrio cuando QBC = 0. Sin embargo, si este término de compatibilidad aumenta lo suficiente, el equilibrio se pierde y se convierte en epidemia. Ejemplo 6.4. Considere la unión de un gráfico de cuadrícula bidimensional infinito con nodos U (x, y) y un gráfico de línea infinito con nodos V (y). Agregue un borde entre U (1, Y) y V (y) para todo y. Para esta red, consideramos la configuración inicial en la que todos los nodos V (Y) seleccionan A, y el nodo U (X, Y) selecciona B si x <0 y selecciona C de lo contrario. Ahora definimos los parámetros de este juego de la siguiente manera. Deje Qa = 3.95, QB = 1.25, QC = 1 y QBC = 0. Se verifica fácilmente que para estos valores, la configuración inicial dada anteriormente es un equilibrio. Sin embargo, ahora supongamos que aumentamos el término de coordinación, configurando QBC = 0.9. Este no es un equilibrio, ya que cada nodo de la forma U (0, y) ahora tiene un incentivo para cambiar de C (generando una recompensa de 3.9) a B (generando así una recompensa de 3.95). Sin embargo, una vez que estos nodos han adoptado B, la mejor respuesta para cada nodo del Formulario U (1, Y) es A (A genera una recompensa de 4 donde B solo B solo genera un pago de 3.95). A partir de aquí, no es difícil demostrar que se extienda directamente en toda la red.7. Referencias [1] L. Blume. La mecánica estadística de la interacción estratégica.

        "There are a range of reasons why this phenomenon occurs, many of which - based on legal, social, or business considerations - seem to defy concise mathematical models.",
        "Despite this, we show that the advantages of limited compatibility can arise in a very simple model of diffusion in social networks, thus offering a basic explanation for this phenomenon in purely strategic terms.",
        "Our approach builds on work on the diffusion of innovations in the economics literature, which seeks to model how a new technology A might spread through a social network of individuals who are currently users of technology B.",
        "We consider several ways of capturing the compatibility of A and B, focusing primarily on a model in which users can choose to adopt A, adopt B, or - at an extra cost - adopt both A and B.",
        "We characterize how the ability of A to spread depends on both its quality relative to B, and also this additional cost of adopting both, and find some surprising non-monotonicity properties in the dependence on these parameters: in some cases, for one technology to survive the introduction of another, the cost of adopting both technologies must be balanced within a narrow, intermediate range.",

        "A fundamental question in the social sciences is to understand the ways in which new ideas, behaviors, and practices diffuse through populations.",
        "Such issues arise, for example, in the adoption of new technologies, the emergence of new social norms or organizational conventions, or the spread of human languages [2, 14, 15, 16, 17].",
        "An active line of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].",
        "We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13], which will form the starting point for our work here.",
        "We describe it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose.",
        "Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B, which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system in order to communicate.",
        "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
        "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",
        "Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B.",
        "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
        "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
        "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
        "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",
        "Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality.",
        "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
        "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
        "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
        "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
        "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
        "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
        "What might we learn from such an extension?",
        "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
        "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
        "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
        "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
        "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
        "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
        "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
        "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
        "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
        "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
        "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
        "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
        "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
        "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
        "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
        "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
        "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
        "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
        "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
        "Our Results.",
        "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
        "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
        "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
        "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
        "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
        "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
        "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
        "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
        "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
        "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
        "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
        "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
        "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
        "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
        "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
        "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
        "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
        "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
        "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
        "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
        "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
        "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
        "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
        "Further Extensions.",
        "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
        "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
        "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
        "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
        "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
        "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
        "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
        "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",
        "MODEL We now develop some further notation and definitions that will be useful for expressing the model.",
        "Recall that we have an infinite Δ-regular graph G, and strategies A, B, and AB that are used in a coordination game on each edge.",
        "For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB.",
        "The overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of the above values over all neighbors w of v, minus a cost which is 0 if v chooses A or B and c = rΔ if she chooses AB.",
        "We refer to the overall game, played by all nodes in G, as a contagion game, and denote it using the tuple (G, q, r).",
        "This game can have many Nash equilibria.",
        "In particular, the two states where everybody uses technology A or everybody uses technology B are both equilibria of this game.",
        "As discussed in the previous section, we are interested in the dynamics of reaching an equilibrium in this game; in particular, we would like to know whether it is possible to move from an all-B equilibrium to an all-A equilibrium by changing the strategy of a finite number of agents, and following a sequence of best-response moves.",

        "Similarly, for two states s and s and a finite sequence S = v1, v2, . . . , vk of vertices of G (where vis are not necessarily distinct), we say s S → s if there is a sequence of states s1, . . . , sk−1 such that s v1 → s1 v2 → s2 v3 → · · · sk−1 vk → s .",
        "For an infinite sequence S = v1, v2, . . . of vertices of G, we denote the subsequence v1, v2, . . . , vk by Sk.",
        "We say s S → s for two states s and s if for every vertex v ∈ V (G) there exists a k0(v) such that for every k > k0(v), s Sk → sk for a state sk with sk(v) = s (v).",
        "DEFINITION 2.2.",
        "For T ⊆ V (G), we denote by sT the strategy profile that assigns A to every agent in T and B to every agent in V (G) \\ T. We say that technology A can become an epidemic in the game (G, q, r) if there is a finite set T of nodes in G (called the seed set) and a sequence S of vertices in V (G) \\ T (where each vertex can appear more than once) such that sT S → sV (G), i.e., endowing agents in T with technology A and letting other agents play their best response according to schedule S would lead every agent to eventually adopt strategy A.2 The above definition requires that the all-A equilibrium be reachable from the initial state by at least one schedule S of best-response moves.",
        "In fact, we will show in Section 4 that if A can become an epidemic in a game, then for every schedule of best-response moves of the nodes in V (G) \\ T in which each node is scheduled an infinite number of times, eventually all nodes adopt strategy A.3 3.",
        "EXAMPLES We begin by considering some basic examples that yield epidemic regions with the kinds of non-convexity properties discussed 2 Note that in our definition we assume that agents in T are endowed with the strategy A at the beginning.",
        "Alternatively, one can define the notion of epidemic by allowing agents in T to be endowed with any combination of AB and A, or with just AB.",
        "However, the difference between these definitions is rather minor and our results carry over with little or no change to these alternative models. 3 Note that we assume agents in the seed set T cannot change their strategy. 0−1 1 2 Figure 2: The thick line graph in Section 1.",
        "We first discuss a natural Δ-regular generalization of the infinite line graph, and for this one we work out the complete analysis that describes the region Ω(G), the set of all pairs (q, r) for which the technology A can become an epidemic.",

        "Consider the decision faced by the agents in group 1, who have their right-hand neighbors using B and their left-hand neighbors using A.",
        "For these agents, the payoffs of strategies A, B, and AB are (1 − q)Δ/2, qΔ/2, and Δ/2 − rΔ, respectively.",
        "Therefore, if q ≤ 1 2 and q ≤ 2r, the best response of such an agent is A.",
        "Hence, if the above inequality holds and we let agents in groups 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . play their best response in this order, then A will become an epidemic.",
        "Also, if we have q > 2r and q ≤ 1 − 2r, the best response of an agent with her neighbors on one side playing A and neighbors on the other side playing B is the strategy AB.",
        "Therefore, if we let agents in groups 1 and −1 change to their best response, they would switch their strategy to AB.",
        "After this, agents in group 2 will see AB on their left and B on their right.",
        "For these agents (and similarly for the agents in group −2), the payoff of strategies A, B, and AB are (1−q)Δ/2, qΔ, and (q+max(q, 1−q))Δ/2− rΔ, respectively.",

        "Hence, if the above inequality holds and we let agents in groups 2, −2, 3, −3 . . . play their best response in this order, then every agent (except for agents in group 0) switches to AB.",
        "Next, if we let agents in groups 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . change their strategy again, for q ≤ 1/2, every agent will switch to strategy A, and hence A becomes an epidemic.4 4 Strictly speaking, since we defined a schedule of moves as a single infinite sequence of vertices in V (G) \\ T, the order 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . is not a valid schedule.",

        "To this end, we must first argue that contagion games in fact have well-defined and stable equilibria.",
        "We then discuss some respects in which the equilibrium reached from an initial state is essentially independent of the order in which best-response updates are performed.",

        "We now show that every best response move decreases the value of this function by some positive amount bounded away from zero.",
        "By Lemma 4.1, we only need to analyze the effect on the potential function for moves of the sort described by the lemma.",
        "Therefore we have three cases: a node u switches from strategy B to AB, a node u switches from strategy AB to A, or a node u switches from strategy B to A.",

(1) Now, notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of −qzA + c as zA edges are removed from the XA,B edges between A and B and the size of partition piece AB is increased by one.",

        "We have shown the potential function is non-increasing for our choice of q and c. This implies the potential function is eventually constant.",
        "As c is irrational and the remaining terms are always rational, both nAB and XA,B must remain constant for the potential function as a whole to remain constant.",
        "Suppose A is epidemic in this region.",
        "As nAB is constant and A is epidemic, it must be that nAB = 0.",
        "Thus, the only moves involve a node u switching from strategy B to strategy A.",
        "In order for XA,B to be constant for such moves, it must be that zA (the number of neighbors of u in A) equals zB (the number of neighbors of u in B) and, as nAB = 0, we have that zA = zB = Δ/2.",

        "LIMITED COMPATIBILITY We now consider some further ways of modeling compatibility and interoperability.",
        "We first consider two technologies, as in the previous sections, and introduce off-diagonal payoffs to capture a positive benefit in direct A-B interactions.",
        "We find that this is 81 in fact no more general than the model with zero payoffs for A-B interactions.",

        "Two technologies.",

        "Here we consider the special case in which these off-diagonal entries are symmetric, i.e., xAB = xBA = x.",
        "We also assume that x < q ≤ 1 − q.",
        "We first show that the game with off-diagonal entries is equivalent to a game without these entries, under a simple re-scaling of q and r. Note that if we re-scale all payoffs by either an additive or a multiplicative constant, the behavior of the game is unaffected.",
        "Given a game with off-diagonal entries parameterized by q, r and x, consider subtracting x from all payoffs, and scaling up by a factor of 1/(1 − 2x).",
        "As can be seen by examining Table 1, the resulting payoffs are exactly those of a game without off-diagonal entries, parameterized by q = (q − x)/(1 − 2x) and r = r/(1 − 2x).",
        "Thus the addition of symmetric off-diagonal entries does not expand the class of games being considered.",
        "Table 1 represents the payoffs in the coordination game in terms of these parameters.",
        "Nevertheless, we can still ask how the addition of an off-diagonal entry might affect the outcome of any particular game.",
        "As the following example shows, increasing compatibility between two technologies can allow one technology that was not initially epidemic to become so.",
        "EXAMPLE 6.1.",
        "Consider the contagion game played on a thick line graph (see Section 3) with r = 5/32 and q = 3/8.",
        "In this case, A is not epidemic, as can be seen by examining Figure 1, since 2r < q and q + r > 1/2.",
        "However, if we insert symmetric off-diagonal payoffs x = 1/4, we have a new game, equivalent to a game parameterized by r = 5/16 and q = 1/4.",
        "Since q < 1/2 and q < 2r , A is epidemic in this game, and thus also in the game with limited compatibility.",
        "We now show that generally, if A is the superior technology (i.e., q < 1/2), adding a compatibility term x can only help A spread.",
        "THEOREM 6.2.",
        "Let G be a game without compatibility, parameterized by r and q on a particular network.",
        "Let G be that same game, but with an added symmetric compatibility term x.",
        "If A is epidemic for G, then A is epidemic for G .",

        "Given the complex structure inherent in contagion games with two technologies, the understanding of contagion games with three or more technologies is largely open.",
        "Here we indicate some of the technical issues that come up with multiple technologies, through a series of initial results.",
        "The basic set-up we study is one in which two incumbent technologies B and C are initially coexisting, and a third technology A, superior to both, is introduced initially at a finite set of nodes.",
        "We first present a theorem stating that for any even Δ, there is a contagion game on a Δ−regular graph in which the two incumbent technologies B and C may find it beneficial to increase their compatibility so as to prevent getting wiped out by the new superior technology A.",
        "In particular, we consider a situation in which initially, two technologies B and C with zero compatibility are at a stable state.",
        "By a stable state, we mean that no finite perturbation of the current states can lead to an epidemic for either B or C. We also have a technology A that is superior to both B and C, and can become epidemic by forcing a single node to choose A.",
        "However, by increasing their compatibility, B and C can maintain their stability and resist an epidemic from A.",
        "Let qA denote the payoffs to two adjacent nodes that both choose technology A, and define qB and qC analogously.",
        "We will assume qA > qB > qC .",
        "We also assume that r, the cost of selecting additional technologies, is sufficiently large so as to ensure that nodes never adopt more than one technology.",
        "Finally, we consider a compatibility parameter qBC that represents the payoffs to two adjacent nodes when one selects B and the other selects C. Thus our contagion game is now described by five parameters (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ).",
        "THEOREM 6.3.",
        "For any even Δ ≥ 12, there is a Δ-regular graph G, an initial state s, and values qA, qB, qC , and qBC , such that • s is an equilibrium in both (G, qA, qB, qC , 0) and (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ), • neither B nor C can become epidemic in either (G, qA, qB, qC , 0) or (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ) starting from state s, • A can become epidemic (G, qA, qB, qC , 0) starting from state s, and • A can not become epidemic in (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ) starting from state s. PROOF. (Sketch.)",
        "Given Δ, define G by starting with an infinite grid and connecting each node to its nearest Δ − 2 neighbors that are in the same row.",
        "The initial state s assigns strategy B to even rows and strategy C to odd rows.",
        "Let qA = 4k2 + 4k + 1/2, qB = 2k + 2, qC = 2k + 1, and qBC = 2k + 3/4.",
        "The first, third, and fourth claims in the theorem can be verified by checking the corresponding inequalities.",
        "The second claim follows from the first and the observation that the alternating rows contain any plausible epidemic from growing vertically.",
        "The above theorem shows that two technologies may both be able to survive the introduction of a new technology by increasing their level of compatibility with each other.",
        "As one might expect, 82 A B AB A (1 − q; 1 − q) (x; x) (1 − q; 1 − q − r) B (x; x) (q; q) (q; q − r) AB (1 − q − r; 1 − q) (q − r; q) (max(q, 1 − q) − r; max(q, 1 − q) − r) Table 1: The payoffs in the coordination game.",
        "Entry (x, y) in row i, column j indicates that the row player gets a payoff of x and the column player gets a payoff of y when the row player plays strategy i and the column player plays strategy j. there are cases when increased compatibility between two technologies helps one technology at the expense of the other.",
        "Surprisingly, however, there are also instances in which compatibility is in fact harmful to both parties; the next example considers a fixed initial configuration with technologies A, B and C that is at equilibrium when qBC = 0.",
        "However, if this compatibility term is increased sufficiently, equilibrium is lost, and A becomes epidemic.",
        "EXAMPLE 6.4.",
        "Consider the union of an infinite two-dimensional grid graph with nodes u(x, y) and an infinite line graph with nodes v(y).",
        "Add an edge between u(1, y) and v(y) for all y.",
        "For this network, we consider the initial configuration in which all v(y) nodes select A, and node u(x, y) selects B if x < 0 and selects C otherwise.",
        "We now define the parameters of this game as follows.",
        "Let qA = 3.95, qB = 1.25, qC = 1, and qBC = 0.",
        "It is easily verified that for these values, the initial configuration given above is an equilibrium.",
        "However, now suppose we increase the coordination term, setting qBC = 0.9.",
        "This is not an equilibrium, since each node of the form u(0, y) now has an incentive to switch from C (generating a payoff of 3.9) to B (thereby generating a payoff of 3.95).",
        "However, once these nodes have adopted B, the best-response for each node of the form u(1, y) is A (A generates a payoff of 4 where as B only generates a payoff of 3.95).",

                "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",

                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",

                "An active line of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].",
                "We begin by discussing one of the most basic <br>game-theoretic diffusion model</br>s, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13], which will form the starting point for our work here.",

                "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",
                "Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B.",
                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
                "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",
                "Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality.",
                "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",

                "We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13], which will form the starting point for our work here.",
                "We describe it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose.",
                "Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B, which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system in order to communicate.",
                "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",
                "Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B.",
                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
                "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",
                "Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality.",
                "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of <br>strategic incompatibility</br>; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",
                "MODEL We now develop some further notation and definitions that will be useful for expressing the model.",

                "For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB.",

                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",

                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",

                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this <br>bilinguality</br> is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But <br>bilinguality</br> is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",

                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and <br>bilinguality</br>, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",

                "Such issues arise, for example, in the adoption of new technologies, the emergence of new social norms or organizational conventions, or the spread of human languages [2, 14, 15, 16, 17].",
                "An active line of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].",
                "We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13], which will form the starting point for our work here.",
                "We describe it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose.",
                "Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B, which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system in order to communicate.",
                "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",
                "Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B.",
                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
                "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",
                "Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality.",
                "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of <br>limited compatibility</br> - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",
                "MODEL We now develop some further notation and definitions that will be useful for expressing the model.",
                "Recall that we have an infinite Δ-regular graph G, and strategies A, B, and AB that are used in a coordination game on each edge.",
                "For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB.",
                "The overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of the above values over all neighbors w of v, minus a cost which is 0 if v chooses A or B and c = rΔ if she chooses AB.",
                "We refer to the overall game, played by all nodes in G, as a contagion game, and denote it using the tuple (G, q, r).",
                "This game can have many Nash equilibria.",
                "In particular, the two states where everybody uses technology A or everybody uses technology B are both equilibria of this game.",
                "As discussed in the previous section, we are interested in the dynamics of reaching an equilibrium in this game; in particular, we would like to know whether it is possible to move from an all-B equilibrium to an all-A equilibrium by changing the strategy of a finite number of agents, and following a sequence of best-response moves.",

                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",

(E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",

                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",

                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",

                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and <br>interoperability</br> in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their <br>interoperability</br> to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",

                "For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB.",

                "An active line of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].",
                "We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13], which will form the starting point for our work here.",
                "We describe it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose.",
                "Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B, which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system in order to communicate.",
                "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",
                "Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B.",
                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
                "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",
                "Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality.",
                "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",
                "MODEL We now develop some further notation and definitions that will be useful for expressing the model.",
                "Recall that we have an infinite Δ-regular graph G, and strategies A, B, and AB that are used in a coordination game on each edge.",
                "For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB.",
                "The overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of the above values over all neighbors w of v, minus a cost which is 0 if v chooses A or B and c = rΔ if she chooses AB.",
                "We refer to the overall game, played by all nodes in G, as a contagion game, and denote it using the tuple (G, q, r).",
                "This game can have many Nash equilibria.",
                "In particular, the two states where everybody uses technology A or everybody uses technology B are both equilibria of this game.",
                "As discussed in the previous section, we are interested in the dynamics of reaching an equilibrium in this game; in particular, we would like to know whether it is possible to move from an all-B equilibrium to an all-A equilibrium by changing the strategy of a finite number of agents, and following a sequence of best-response moves.",

                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a <br>characterization</br> that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate <br>characterization</br> of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the <br>characterization</br> theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our <br>characterization</br> of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",
                "MODEL We now develop some further notation and definitions that will be useful for expressing the model.",
                "Recall that we have an infinite Δ-regular graph G, and strategies A, B, and AB that are used in a coordination game on each edge.",
                "For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB.",
                "The overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of the above values over all neighbors w of v, minus a cost which is 0 if v chooses A or B and c = rΔ if she chooses AB.",

                "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",
                "Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B.",
                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
                "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",

                "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",

                "Despite this, we show that the advantages of limited compatibility can arise in a very simple model of diffusion in social networks, thus offering a basic explanation for this phenomenon in purely strategic terms.",
                "Our approach builds on work on the diffusion of innovations in the economics literature, which seeks to model how a new technology A might spread through a social network of individuals who are currently users of technology B.",
                "We consider several ways of capturing the compatibility of A and B, focusing primarily on a model in which users can choose to adopt A, adopt B, or - at an extra cost - adopt both A and B.",
                "We characterize how the ability of A to spread depends on both its quality relative to B, and also this additional cost of adopting both, and find some surprising non-monotonicity properties in the dependence on these parameters: in some cases, for one technology to survive the introduction of another, the cost of adopting both technologies must be balanced within a narrow, intermediate range.",

                "A fundamental question in the social sciences is to understand the ways in which new ideas, behaviors, and practices diffuse through populations.",
                "Such issues arise, for example, in the adoption of new technologies, the emergence of new social norms or organizational conventions, or the spread of human languages [2, 14, 15, 16, 17].",
                "An active line of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].",
                "We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13], which will form the starting point for our work here.",
                "We describe it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose.",
                "Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B, which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system in order to communicate.",
                "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",
                "Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B.",
                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
                "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",
                "Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality.",
                "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the <br>contagion threshold</br> of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible <br>contagion threshold</br> for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the <br>contagion threshold</br> is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a <br>contagion threshold</br> greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a <br>contagion threshold</br> q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible <br>contagion threshold</br> supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the <br>contagion threshold</br> [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",
                "MODEL We now develop some further notation and definitions that will be useful for expressing the model.",
                "Recall that we have an infinite Δ-regular graph G, and strategies A, B, and AB that are used in a coordination game on each edge.",
                "For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB.",
                "The overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of the above values over all neighbors w of v, minus a cost which is 0 if v chooses A or B and c = rΔ if she chooses AB.",
                "We refer to the overall game, played by all nodes in G, as a contagion game, and denote it using the tuple (G, q, r).",
                "This game can have many Nash equilibria.",
                "In particular, the two states where everybody uses technology A or everybody uses technology B are both equilibria of this game.",
                "As discussed in the previous section, we are interested in the dynamics of reaching an equilibrium in this game; in particular, we would like to know whether it is possible to move from an all-B equilibrium to an all-A equilibrium by changing the strategy of a finite number of agents, and following a sequence of best-response moves.",

                "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",

                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
                "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",

                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",

                "For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB.",

                "An active line of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].",
                "We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13], which will form the starting point for our work here.",
                "We describe it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose.",
                "Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B, which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system in order to communicate.",
                "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",
                "Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B.",
                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
                "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",
                "Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality.",
                "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a <br>potential function</br> argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",
                "MODEL We now develop some further notation and definitions that will be useful for expressing the model.",

                "There are a range of reasons why this phenomenon occurs, many of which - based on legal, social, or business considerations - seem to defy concise mathematical models.",
                "Despite this, we show that the advantages of limited compatibility can arise in a very simple model of diffusion in social networks, thus offering a basic explanation for this phenomenon in purely strategic terms.",
                "Our approach builds on work on the diffusion of innovations in the economics literature, which seeks to model how a new technology A might spread through a social network of individuals who are currently users of technology B.",
                "We consider several ways of capturing the compatibility of A and B, focusing primarily on a model in which users can choose to adopt A, adopt B, or - at an extra cost - adopt both A and B.",
                "We characterize how the ability of A to spread depends on both its quality relative to B, and also this additional cost of adopting both, and find some surprising non-monotonicity properties in the dependence on these parameters: in some cases, for one technology to survive the introduction of another, the cost of adopting both technologies must be balanced within a narrow, intermediate range.",

                "A fundamental question in the social sciences is to understand the ways in which new ideas, behaviors, and practices diffuse through populations.",
                "Such issues arise, for example, in the adoption of new technologies, the emergence of new social norms or organizational conventions, or the spread of human languages [2, 14, 15, 16, 17].",
                "An active line of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].",
                "We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13], which will form the starting point for our work here.",
                "We describe it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose.",
                "Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B, which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system in order to communicate.",
                "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",
                "Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B.",
                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
                "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",
                "Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality.",
                "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",
                "MODEL We now develop some further notation and definitions that will be useful for expressing the model.",
                "Recall that we have an infinite Δ-regular graph G, and strategies A, B, and AB that are used in a coordination game on each edge.",
                "For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB.",
                "The overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of the above values over all neighbors w of v, minus a cost which is 0 if v chooses A or B and c = rΔ if she chooses AB.",
                "We refer to the overall game, played by all nodes in G, as a contagion game, and denote it using the tuple (G, q, r).",
                "This game can have many Nash equilibria.",
                "In particular, the two states where everybody uses technology A or everybody uses technology B are both equilibria of this game.",
                "As discussed in the previous section, we are interested in the dynamics of reaching an equilibrium in this game; in particular, we would like to know whether it is possible to move from an all-B equilibrium to an all-A equilibrium by changing the strategy of a finite number of agents, and following a sequence of best-response moves.",

                "In fact, we will show in Section 4 that if A can become an epidemic in a game, then for every schedule of best-response moves of the nodes in V (G) \\ T in which each node is scheduled an infinite number of times, eventually all nodes adopt strategy A.3 3.",

                "An active line of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].",
                "We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13], which will form the starting point for our work here.",
                "We describe it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose.",
                "Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B, which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system in order to communicate.",
                "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",
                "Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B.",
                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
                "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",
                "Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality.",
                "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",

                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",

                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",

                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",

                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",

                "A fundamental question in the social sciences is to understand the ways in which new ideas, behaviors, and practices diffuse through populations.",
                "Such issues arise, for example, in the adoption of new technologies, the emergence of new social norms or organizational conventions, or the spread of human languages [2, 14, 15, 16, 17].",
                "An active line of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].",
                "We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13], which will form the starting point for our work here.",
                "We describe it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose.",
                "Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B, which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system in order to communicate.",
                "There is a social network G on the users, indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).",
                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",
                "Specifically, consider a network G, and let all nodes initially play B.",
                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",
                "If we apply best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",
                "Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality.",
                "In most of the settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence (however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human languages and social conventions coexist along geographic boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS.",
                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",
                "MODEL We now develop some further notation and definitions that will be useful for expressing the model.",
                "Recall that we have an infinite Δ-regular graph G, and strategies A, B, and AB that are used in a coordination game on each edge.",
                "For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB.",
                "The overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of the above values over all neighbors w of v, minus a cost which is 0 if v chooses A or B and c = rΔ if she chooses AB.",
                "We refer to the overall game, played by all nodes in G, as a contagion game, and denote it using the tuple (G, q, r).",
                "This game can have many Nash equilibria.",
                "In particular, the two states where everybody uses technology A or everybody uses technology B are both equilibria of this game.",
                "As discussed in the previous section, we are interested in the dynamics of reaching an equilibrium in this game; in particular, we would like to know whether it is possible to move from an all-B equilibrium to an all-A equilibrium by changing the strategy of a finite number of agents, and following a sequence of best-response moves.",

                "An active line of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].",

                "Note that A is the better technology if q < 1 2 , in the sense that A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse technology if q > 1 2 . 75 A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion model even at this level of simplicity.",

                "Now suppose a small number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead.",

(E.g. you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends are users of it.)",
                "As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.",
                "Morris [13] provides a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e. the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).",

                "An important piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.",
                "In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become bilingual.",
                "In the case of human language diffusion, this bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have inhabitants who speak both.",
                "But bilinguality is also an essential feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.",
                "Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to themselves.",
                "What might we learn from such an extension?",
                "To begin with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins competition among technology companies.",
                "There is a large literature on how compatibility among technologies affects competition between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9, 12].",
                "Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies (including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11] and instant messenger systems [6].",
                "While these existing models of compatibility capture network effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its own social network neighbors are doing.",
                "A diffusion model that incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.",
                "The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior.",
                "In this paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.",
                "We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morriss model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior.",
                "Consider again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B.",
                "An adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both receive max(q, 1 − q).",
                "Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the cost of having to maintain both technologies.",
                "Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).",
                "Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.",
                "Formally, we say that strategy A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A.",
                "We also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.",
                "In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗ (G): this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in G with parameter q in the payoff structure.",
                "A central result of [13] is that 1 2 is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any graph: supG q∗ (G) = 1 2 .",
                "Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .",
                "In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ (G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion threshold supG q∗ (G), we must consider the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network. 1 We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morriss paper [13]): less intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties, and the qualitative phenomena remain the same. 76 1/20 1 r q 0 1/2 1 Figure 1: The region of the (q, r) plane for which technology A can become epidemic on the infinite line.",
                "Our Results.",
                "We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G) can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find analogous shapes that become even more complex for other simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.)",
                "In particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1 2 , strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some intermediate interval.",
                "In other words, strategy B (which represents the worse technology, since q < 1 2 ) will survive if and only if the cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.",
                "This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network structure.",
                "It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to give such an interpretation, as follows.",
                "When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.",
                "Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction benefits without paying the penalty of r. When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence A will spread step-by-step through the network.",
                "When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy.",
                "Once this happens, the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no further progress.",
                "Hence, this intermediate value of r allows a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and the adopters of B.",
                "In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of direct conversions to A.",
                "But if it has the right balance in the value of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary where nodes adopt AB.",
                "Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G).",
                "For any given value of Δ, the region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.",
                "However, we can show via a potential function argument that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.",
                "Moreover, we can show the existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .",
                "On the other hand, consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that (1 2 , r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large.",
                "Hence, neither Ω nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.",
                "Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate characterization of the region Ω(G).",
                "In Morriss setting, without an AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to diffusion in his setting.",
                "With the AB strategy as a further option, a more complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes.",
                "We show that such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.",
                "The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking, that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each node attempts to update itself infinitely often).",
                "Further Extensions.",
                "Another way to model compatibility and interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A and a node adopting B.",
                "Rather than setting these to 0, we can consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q).",
                "We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.",
                "Moreover, using our characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can still become epidemic with the new parameters.",
                "We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.",
                "We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third, better technology A at a finite set of nodes.",
                "We show an example in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too high to lie in this range.",
                "Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market. 2.",

                "For edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy AB.",
