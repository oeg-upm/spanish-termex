A feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users manage and re-find information, but very few have been evaluated. This has been noted by several scholars and explained by the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations. The difficulties include that people re-find information from within unique personal collections; researchers know little about the tasks that cause people to re-find information; and numerous privacy issues concerning personal information. In this paper we aim to facilitate PIM evaluations by addressing each of these difficulties. In the first part, we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks. The study examines the kind of tasks that require users to re-find information and produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and web pages. In the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using two different methods of task creation.

INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information. PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular. However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic. One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM. People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks. This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences. As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation. Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation. The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections. Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations. A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7]. Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation. For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible. Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level. In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations. In the first part of this paper we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks. The study examines the kind of tasks that require users to re-find information and produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and web pages. We also look at the features of the tasks that make re-finding difficult. In the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using different methods of task creation. Thus, this paper offers two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 2. RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM. Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments. These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM. As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks. A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15]. Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7]. Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues. Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations. Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings. An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis. This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system. In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved. Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer. Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy. Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants. Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers. Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time. It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs. This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks. Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope. One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate. Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research. This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13]. However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection. One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab. This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21]. The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access. Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4]. This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5]. A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection. Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26]. A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour. For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3]. Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2]. However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before. Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM. The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22]. There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks. For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24]. While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks. Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult. Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised. Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11]. Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object. Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11]. This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants? A few methods have been proposed. For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants. This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks. Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties. In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this. In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions. In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information. In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour. The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives. Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period. Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested. Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants. In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages. The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22]. In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations. We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants. This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3. METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer. Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation. In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data. To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding. By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained. The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed. Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen. The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing. This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information. To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session. The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples. The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected. The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard). Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information. Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago). Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks. The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students. The ages of participants ranged from 19-59. As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4. RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data. The following sections present the findings. Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web. Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants. Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased. As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants. The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5). More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3). This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days. From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding. Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks. The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks. Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known. Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical. Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner. This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project. I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task. Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for. Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information. In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource. Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages. Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task. Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend. Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework. Remind myself of what it is and what it does. Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify. For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper). It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource. There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item. For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page. It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email. Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box. Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable. To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks. The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%). Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks. The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement. We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme. The distribution of task types is shown in table 1. Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded. The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding. The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item). Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email. Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%). Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold. We classified the tasks using the form data. Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold. Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified. The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable. A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2. Hot Warm Cold Unclass. Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week. However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information. This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23]. This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult? We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others. For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be. There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult. We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult. Figure 1 shows this information graphically. Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot. To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05). For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593). For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272). These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be. Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be. To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks. We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources. It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks. Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level. The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5. TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions. Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems. This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item). In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks. Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections. This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment. There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task. Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date. Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs. To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks. The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available. The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks. The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks. They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper. Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task? Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice. Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed. Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances. Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation. Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions. These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality. However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters? Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc. However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data. From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks. This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation. This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations. Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types. Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks. There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks. This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs. Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation. However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy. This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1. We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour. Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation. As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks. The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks. For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information. This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections. Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source. For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies. There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups. For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs. To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours. These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies. This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17]. Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs. Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation. We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data. For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies. Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information. This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups. Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants. We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive. Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed. When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2]. A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures. If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study. The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design. Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment. The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy. The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type. Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10]. Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy. More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6. CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations. The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks. We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections. This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections. In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations. In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages. The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks. We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources. In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation. We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy. We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections. These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants. We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation. Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users. Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.

Introducción La gestión de información personal (PIM) es un área de investigación de rápido crecimiento en cuestión de cómo las personas almacenan, administran y vuelven a encontrar información. Los sistemas PIM, los métodos y procedimientos por los cuales las personas manejan, clasifican y recuperan la información del día a día [18], se están volviendo cada vez más populares. Sin embargo, la evaluación de estos sistemas PIM es problemática. Una de las principales dificultades es causada por la naturaleza personal de PIM. Las personas recopilan información como consecuencia natural de completar otras tareas. Esto significa que las colecciones que generan las personas son exclusivas de ellas y la información dentro de una colección está intrínsecamente vinculada con las experiencias personales de los propietarios. Como las colecciones personales son únicas, no podemos crear tareas de evaluación aplicables a todos los participantes en una evaluación. En segundo lugar, las colecciones personales pueden contener información de que los participantes se sienten incómodos compartiendo dentro de una evaluación. La naturaleza precisa de esta información, qué información preferirían mantener privadas, varía entre las personas que dificultan basar las tareas de búsqueda en el contenido de las colecciones individuales. Por lo tanto, los experimentadores enfrentan una serie de desafíos para realizar evaluaciones PIM realistas pero controladas. Una característica particular de PIM Research es que muchos sistemas han sido diseñados para ayudar a los usuarios a administrar y volver a encontrar su información, pero muy pocos han sido evaluados;Una situación observada por varios estudiosos [1, 6, 7]. Recientemente, sin embargo, los investigadores han comenzado a centrarse en las formas de abordar el problema de la evaluación PIM. Por ejemplo, Kelly [16] propone que se deben tomar numerosas metodologías para examinar y comprender los muchos problemas involucrados en PIM, aunque hace referencia explícita a la necesidad de estudios PIM basados en el laboratorio y un conjunto común de tareas compartidas para hacer esto posible.. CAPRA [6] también identifica la necesidad de evaluaciones de laboratorio PIM controladas para complementar otras técnicas de evaluación, lo que pone énfasis específico en la necesidad de comprender el comportamiento PIM a nivel de tarea. En este documento, intentamos abordar las dificultades involucradas para facilitar las evaluaciones de PIM de laboratorio controladas. En la primera parte de este artículo presentamos un estudio diario de tareas de reinicio de información. El estudio examina el tipo de tareas que requieren que los usuarios vuelvan a encontrar información y produzcan una taxonomía de reiniciar tareas para mensajes de correo electrónico y páginas web. También observamos las características de las tareas que dificultan la reinfección. En la segunda parte, proponemos una metodología de evaluación basada en tareas basada en nuestros hallazgos y examinamos la viabilidad del enfoque utilizando diferentes métodos de creación de tareas. Por lo tanto, este documento ofrece dos contribuciones al campo: una mayor comprensión del comportamiento PIM en el nivel de tarea y un método de evaluación que facilitará más investigaciones.2. Trabajo relacionado Una variedad de enfoques están disponibles para estudiar PIM. Los enfoques naturalistas estudian participantes que se desempeñan naturalmente, completando sus propias tareas a medida que ocurren, dentro de entornos familiares. Estos enfoques permiten a los investigadores superar muchas de las dificultades causadas por la naturaleza personal del PIM. Como las tareas realizadas son reales y no simuladas, los participantes pueden utilizar sus propias experiencias, conocimiento previo y colecciones de información para completar las tareas. Un beneficio del enfoque es que los datos se pueden capturar continuamente durante períodos de tiempo prolongados y las mediciones se pueden tomar en puntos fijos en el tiempo dentro de estos [15]. Los enfoques naturalistas se pueden aplicar realizando el trabajo de campo [17, 8], métodos etnográficos según lo sugerido por [15] o mediante análisis de archivos de registro [9, 7]. Los métodos etnográficos y de trabajo de campo requieren la presencia de un experimentador para evaluar cómo se realiza PIM, lo que plantea una serie de problemas. En primer lugar, la evaluación de esta manera es costosa;Tomando largos períodos para estudiar un pequeño número de participantes y estas pequeñas muestras pueden no ser representativas del comportamiento de las poblaciones más grandes. En segundo lugar, debido a que los participantes no pueden observarse continuamente, los experimentadores deben elegir cuándo observar y esto puede afectar los hallazgos. Una estrategia alternativa para realizar evaluaciones naturalistas es utilizar el análisis de archivos de registro. Este enfoque utiliza el software de registro que captura una amplia muestra de las actividades del usuario en el contexto del uso natural de un sistema. En [9] se implementó una nueva herramienta de búsqueda PIM en 234 usuarios y los datos de registro proporcionaron información detallada sobre la naturaleza de las consultas de los usuarios, las interacciones con la interfaz de consulta y sobre las propiedades de los elementos recuperados. El análisis de archivos de registro es una metodología poderosa, ya que permite la captura de una gran cantidad de información detallada sobre cómo los usuarios se comportan con el sistema sin el gasto y la influencia de distracción de un observador. Sin embargo, hay limitaciones en esta estrategia. En primer lugar, para obtener resultados útiles, el prototipo implementado debe ser algo que las personas usarían, es decir, debe ser una pieza de software completamente funcional que ofrece una mejora en los sistemas que normalmente estén disponibles para los participantes. Desarrollar un prototipo de investigación a este estándar está más allá de los recursos de muchos investigadores. Además, se debe tener precaución al analizar registros, ya que los datos capturados no muestran nada sobre los objetivos e intenciones que el usuario tenía en ese momento. Por lo tanto, es difícil hacer declaraciones concretas sobre las razones del comportamiento representado en los registros. Esto revela la necesidad de complementar los estudios naturalistas con experimentos controlados donde el experimentador puede relacionar el comportamiento de los participantes del estudio con los objetivos asociados con las tareas de búsqueda conocidas. Los estudios basados en el laboratorio simulan a los usuarios el medio ambiente del mundo real en el entorno controlado del laboratorio, ofreciendo la capacidad de estudiar problemas estrictamente definidos y de alcance estrecho. Una dificultad para realizar este tipo de evaluación es obtener colecciones para evaluar. Kelly [16] propone la introducción de una colección de pruebas compartidas que proporcionaría conjuntos de datos, tareas y métricas compartibles y reutilizables para aquellos interesados en realizar investigaciones PIM. Esto puede ser útil para probar algoritmos de una manera similar a TREC en la corriente principal [13]. Sin embargo, una colección compartida no sería adecuada para los estudios de usuarios porque no sería posible incorporar los aspectos personales del PIM mientras usa una colección común y desconocida. Un enfoque alternativo es pedir a los usuarios que proporcionen sus propias colecciones de información para simular entornos familiares dentro del laboratorio. Este enfoque se ha aplicado para estudiar la reinicia de las fotografías personales [11], los mensajes de correo electrónico [20] y las marcas web [21]. La utilidad de este enfoque depende de lo fácil que sea transferir la colección o obtener acceso remoto. Otra solución es usar toda la web como una colección al estudiar la reinicia de la página web [4]. Esto puede ser apropiado para estudiar la reinicia de la página web porque los estudios anteriores han demostrado que las personas a menudo usan motores de búsqueda web para este propósito [5]. Una segunda dificultad para realizar estudios de laboratorio PIM es crear tareas para que los participantes se realicen que se pueden resolver buscando una colección compartida o personal. Las tareas se relacionan con la actividad que resulta en una necesidad de información [14] y se reconoce que son importantes para determinar el comportamiento del usuario [26]. Se ha llevado a cabo un gran trabajo para comprender la naturaleza de las tareas y cómo el tipo de tarea influye en el comportamiento de búsqueda de información del usuario. Por ejemplo, las tareas se han clasificado en términos de creciente complejidad [3] y se ha sugerido que la complejidad de la tarea afecte cómo los buscadores perciben sus necesidades de información [25] y cómo intentan encontrar información [3]. Otros trabajos anteriores han proporcionado metodologías que permiten la simulación de tareas al estudiar la información que busca el comportamiento [2]. Sin embargo, se sabe poco sobre los tipos de tareas que hacen que las personas busquen en sus tiendas personales o vuelvan a encontrar información que han visto antes. En consecuencia, es difícil idear situaciones de tareas de trabajo simuladas para PIM. La excepción es el estudio de la gestión de fotografías personales, donde Roddens trabaja en clasificar las tareas de búsqueda de fotografías personales ha facilitado la creación de situaciones de tareas de trabajo simuladas [22]. Ha habido otras sugerencias sobre cómo clasificar las tareas PIM. Por ejemplo, [5] pidió a los participantes que clasificaran las tareas en función de la frecuencia con la que realizan el tipo de tarea en su vida diaria y cuán familiarizados estaban con la ubicación de la información solicitada y varios académicos han clasificado los objetos de información por la frecuencia de su uso.p.ej.[24]. Si bien estas son propiedades interesantes que pueden afectar la forma en que se realizará una tarea, no les dan a los experimentadores suficiente alcance para diseñar tareas. Las colecciones personales son una razón por la cual la creación de tareas es tan difícil. La taxonomía de tareas de fotos de Roddens proporciona una solución aquí porque permite clasificar las tareas, adaptadas a colecciones privadas. Los sistemas se pueden comparar en todos los tipos de tareas para diferentes usuarios [11]. Desafortunadamente, no existe taxonomía equivalente para otros tipos de objeto de información. Además, otros tipos de objetos son más sensibles a la privacidad que las fotografías;Es poco probable que los participantes estén tan contentos de permitir a los investigadores navegar por sus colecciones de correo electrónico para crear tareas como lo fueron con fotografías en [11]. Esto presenta un problema grave: ¿cómo pueden los investigadores idear tareas que correspondan a colecciones privadas sin comprender los tipos de tareas que las personas realizan o poniendo en peligro la privacidad de los participantes del estudio? Se han propuesto algunos métodos. Por ejemplo, [20] estudió la búsqueda por correo electrónico pidiendo a los participantes que vuelvan a encontrar correos electrónicos que habían sido enviados a todos los miembros de un departamento;permitiendo que se usen las mismas tareas para todos los participantes del estudio. Este enfoque aseguró que se evitaran problemas de privacidad y que los participantes pudieran usar cosas que recuerdan para completar las tareas. Sin embargo, los sistemas solo se probaron utilizando un tipo de tarea: se les pidió a los participantes que encontraran correos electrónicos individuales, cada uno de los cuales compartía propiedades comunes. En la Sección 4 mostramos que las personas realizan una gama más amplia de tareas de reinicio por correo electrónico que esta. En [4], las tareas de búsqueda genéricas se crearon artificialmente ejecutando evaluaciones en dos sesiones. En la primera sesión, se pidió a los participantes que completaran tareas de trabajo que implicaron encontrar información desconocida. En la segunda sesión, los participantes completaron las mismas tareas nuevamente, lo que naturalmente implicó algún comportamiento de reinicio. Las limitaciones de esta técnica son que no permite a los participantes explotar ninguna conexión personal con la información porque la información que buscan puede no corresponder a ningún otro aspecto de sus vidas. Además, si el tiempo se utiliza por un sistema o interfaz que se está probando, el enfoque no es adecuado porque todos los objetos encontrados en la primera sesión se habrá accedido dentro del mismo período de tiempo. Nuestra revisión de los enfoques de evaluación motiva un requisito de experimentos controlados de laboratorio que permitan probar aspectos estrictamente definidos de los sistemas o interfaces. Desafortunadamente, también se ha demostrado que existen dificultades involucradas en el desempeño de este tipo de evaluación: es difícil obtener colecciones y idear tareas que correspondan a colecciones privadas, al mismo tiempo que protegen la privacidad de los participantes del estudio. En la siguiente sección presentamos un estudio diario de tareas de refinamiento para correo electrónico y páginas web. El resultado es una clasificación de tareas similares a la ideada por Rodden para fotografías personales [22]. En la Sección 5, construimos sobre este trabajo examinando métodos para crear tareas que no comprometen la privacidad de los participantes y discuten cómo nuestro trabajo puede facilitar las evaluaciones de los usuarios PIM basadas en tareas. Mostramos que al recopilar tareas utilizando diarios electrónicos, no solo podemos aprender sobre las tareas que hacen que las personas vuelvan a encontrar información personal, sino que podemos aprender sobre el contenido de las colecciones privadas sin comprometer la privacidad de los participantes. Este conocimiento se puede utilizar para construir tareas para su uso en evaluaciones PIM.3. Los estudios de diario del método son una técnica naturalista, que ofrece la capacidad de capturar datos objetivos, en un entorno natural, sin la influencia que distrae un observador. Las limitaciones de la técnica incluyen dificultades para mantener los niveles de dedicación de los participantes y convencer a los participantes de que la información aparentemente mundana es útil y debe informarse [19].[12] sugieren que los efectos de los negativos pueden ser limitados, sin embargo, con un diseño cuidadoso y una buena implementación. En nuestro estudio del diario, seguimos las sugerencias en [12] para lograr los mejores datos posibles. Con este fin, restringimos las tareas grabadas a la redacción web y por correo electrónico. Al pedir a los usuarios que registren menos tareas, se anticipó que la apatía de los participantes se reduciría y se mantendría los niveles de dedicación. Los participantes recibieron un formulario web personalizado en el que podían registrar detalles sobre sus necesidades de información y los contextos en los que se desarrollaron estas necesidades. Los formularios web se implementaron en lugar de diarios basados en papel porque para volver a encontrar información web y por correo electrónico, el usuario estaría en una computadora con una conexión a Internet y no habría necesidad de buscar un diario y un bolígrafo basados en papel. El formulario del diario solicitó la siguiente información: si la información necesita relacionada con la reinicio de una página web o un mensaje de correo electrónico y una descripción de la tarea que están realizando. Esta descripción era contener tanto la información que el participante deseaba encontrar como la razón por la que necesitaba la información. Para ayudar con esto, el formulario dio tres descripciones de tareas de ejemplo, que también se explicaron verbalmente a cada participante durante una sesión introductoria. El experimentador aseguró que los participantes entendieron que las tareas a registrar no se limitaron a los tipos que se muestran en los ejemplos. Los ejemplos se suministraron exclusivamente para que los participantes pensaran en los tipos de cosas que podían registrar y para mostrar el nivel y el tipo de detalles esperados. El formulario también pidió a los participantes que calificaran cada tarea en términos de dificultad (en una escala de 1-5, donde 1 fue muy fácil y 5 fue muy difícil). Finalmente, se les preguntó cuándo fue la última vez que miraron la información buscada. Una vez más, pudieron elegir entre 5 opciones (hace menos de un día, hace menos de una semana, hace menos de un mes, hace menos de un año, hace más de un año). La información de tiempo se utilizó para examinar la frecuencia con la que los participantes vuelven a descubrir información antigua y nueva, y cuando se combinan con las calificaciones de dificultad crearon una imagen de si el período de tiempo entre el acceso y la reaccionamiento impactó en cuán difíciles se perciben las tareas de los participantes.ser.Se pidió a 36 participantes, reclutados por anuncios masivos a través de canales de comunicación departamentales, reuniones de grupos de investigación y conferencias de pregrado, que registraran digitalmente los detalles de sus tareas de reinicio de información durante un período de aproximadamente 3 semanas. La población final constaba de 4 miembros del personal académico, 8 miembros del personal de investigación, 6 estudiantes de investigación y 18 estudiantes de pregrado. Las edades de los participantes oscilaron entre 19 y 59. A medida que se registraron las tareas personales y de trabajo, los resultados recopilados cubren una amplia gama de tareas de reinicio.4. Resultados Se realizaron varios análisis en los datos capturados. Las siguientes secciones presentan los hallazgos. En primer lugar, examinamos los tipos de tareas de reinicio que se realizaron tanto al buscar en el correo electrónico como en la web. A continuación, consideramos la distribución de tareas, qué tipos de tareas fueron realizadas con mayor frecuencia por los participantes. Por último, exploramos los tipos de tareas de reinicio que los participantes percibieron como difíciles.4.1 Naturaleza de las tareas de reinicio de la web y el correo electrónico durante el estudio 412 tareas se registraron.150 (36.41%) de estas tareas se basaron en correo electrónico, 262 (63.59%) fueron a base de web. Como con la mayoría de los estudios diarios, el número de tareas registradas varió ampliamente entre los participantes. La mediana del número de tareas por participante fue 8 (rango intercuartil (IQR) = 9.5). Se registraron más tareas web (mediana = 5, IQR = 7.5) que las tareas de correo electrónico (mediana = 3, IQR = 3). Esto significa que, en promedio, cada participante registró aproximadamente una tarea cada dos días. De las descripciones suministradas por los participantes, encontramos características similares en las tareas grabadas tanto para el correo electrónico como para la reinfección web. Según esta observación, se diseñó un esquema de clasificación conjunta, que abarca tareas de correo electrónico y web. Las tareas se clasificaron como uno de los tres tipos: tareas de búsqueda, tareas de elementos y tareas de múltiples elementos. Las tareas de búsqueda implican la búsqueda de información específica de un recurso, por ejemplo, un correo electrónico o una página web, donde el recurso puede o no ser conocido. Algunos ejemplos grabados de tareas de búsqueda fueron: • LU1: Buscando el código de curso para una clase: se usa en un script que se ejecuta para configurar una práctica. ID obtuvo previamente esto hace aproximadamente 3 semanas de nuestro sitio web.• LU2: Estoy tratando de determinar la fecha en que renuncio como examinador externo. Esto está en un correo electrónico en algún lugar • LU3: Buscando una descripción del formato de registro del sistema R desarrollado para el proyecto estudiantil. Creo que me envió en TI, un elemento de correo electrónico implica buscar un correo electrónico o página web en particular, tal vez para transmitir a otra persona o cuando se necesita todo el contenido para completar la tarea. Algunos ejemplos registrados de tareas de elementos fueron: • I1: Buscando el documento Sigir 2002 para dar a otro estudiante • I2: Encuentre la recepción de una compra de una aerolínea en línea requerida para reclamar los gastos • i3: Necesito los formularios de evaluación de pares para la clase MIA ELos envió por correo electrónico para aclarar, las tareas de búsqueda difieren de las tareas de los elementos de dos maneras, en la cantidad de información requerida y en lo que el usuario sabe sobre lo que está buscando. Las tareas de búsqueda implican la necesidad de una pequeña información, p.un número de teléfono o un ingrediente, y el usuario puede o no saber exactamente el recurso que contiene esta información. En las tareas de elementos, el usuario sabe exactamente el recurso que está buscando y necesita todo el contenido de ese recurso. Las tareas de múltiples elementos fueron tareas que requerían información contenida en numerosas páginas web o mensajes de correo electrónico. A menudo, estas tareas requerían que el usuario procesara o recopile la información para resolver la tarea. Algunos ejemplos grabados fueron: • MI1: Buscando obituarios y otro material sobre el novelista John Fowles, quien murió el fin de semana. Accedió al Guradian en línea e IMES • MI2: tratando de encontrar detalles sobre el marco de gráficos Piccolo. Recuérdame qué es y qué hace. Buscando construir una GUI dentro de Eclipse • MI3: Estoy tratando de presentar mis correos electrónicos con respecto a IPM y estoy buscando correos electrónicos de esta revista o sobre este diario, hubo una serie de tareas que fueron difíciles de clasificar. Por ejemplo, considere la siguiente tarea registrada: • LU4: Vuelva a encontrar el documento de culo sobre evaluaciones de relevancia calificadas porque quiero ver cómo presentó sus resultados para un documento. Estoy escribiendo esta tarea en realidad consta de dos subasquetas: 1 tarea de elemento(Refinte el documento) y 1 tarea de búsqueda (busque información específica dentro del documento). Se decidió tratar esto como una tarea de búsqueda porque el objetivo final de los usuarios era acceder y usar la información dentro del recurso. Hubo una serie de ejemplos de tareas combinadas, principalmente del elemento de formulario que la búsqueda, pero también hubo ejemplos de elementos que luego múltiples. Por ejemplo: • MI4: Vuelva a encontrar el sitio web de Kelkoo para que pueda volver a verificar los precios de los escaladores de cabello para mi novia, una segunda fuente de ambigüedad provino de tareas, como encontrar un correo electrónico que contenga una URL como un medio para volver a accederuna página web. También se decidió clasificarlas como tareas de búsqueda porque en todos los casos fueron registrados por los participantes como búsquedas por correo electrónico y, dentro de este contexto, lo que estaban buscando era información dentro de un correo electrónico. Otro problema era que algunos de los registros carecían del detalle requerido para realizar una categorización, p.• U1: Buscando cómo recuperar la selección de usuarios de un cuadro de mensaje. Decidió usar otros medios que tales tareas se etiquetaron como U para no clasificable. Para verificar la consistencia de la taxonomía, las tareas fueron recativoradas por el mismo investigador después de un retraso de dos semanas. El acuerdo entre los resultados de los dos análisis fue en gran medida consistente (96.8%). Además, le pedimos a un investigador sin conocimiento del proyecto o el campo que clasifique una muestra de 50 tareas. El segundo investigador logró un acuerdo del 90%. Creemos que este alto acuerdo sobre una gran cantidad de tareas de más de un investigador proporciona evidencia de la confiabilidad del esquema de clasificación. La distribución de los tipos de tareas se muestra en la Tabla 1. En general, las tareas de búsqueda y ítems fueron las más comunes, con tareas de múltiples múltiples que solo representan el 8.98% de las registradas. La distribución de los tipos de tareas fue diferente para la reinfección web y por correo electrónico. La mayoría de las tareas de correo electrónico (60%) involucraban la búsqueda de información dentro de un correo electrónico (búsqueda), en contraste con las tareas web donde la mayoría de las tareas (52.67%) implicaban buscar una sola página web (elemento). Otra distinción fue el número de tareas de múltiples elementos grabadas para la web y el correo electrónico. Las tareas de múltiples elementos eran muy raras para la reinfección de correo electrónico (solo el 2.67% de las tareas de correo electrónico implicaban la búsqueda de recursos múltiples), pero relativamente comunes para la reinfección web (12.6%).

Clasificamos las tareas utilizando los datos del formulario. La información que se había visto menos de un día o menos de una semana antes de que la tarea se definiera como caliente, la información que se había visto menos de un mes antes de la tarea como cálida e información que se había visto menos de un año o más queun año antes de la tarea como frío. Desafortunadamente, una dificultad técnica con el formulario solo permitió clasificar 335 (81.3%) de las tareas. El resto se definió como U para no clasificable. En la Tabla 2 se muestra una tabulación cruzada de los tipos de tareas y las temperaturas. Caliente y caliente frío. Correo electrónico 50 (33.33%) 36 (24.00%) 37 (24.67%) 27 (18%) Web 112 (42.75%) 60 (22.90%) 40 (15.27%) 50 (19.08%) Todos 162 (39.32%) 96 (23.30%) 77 (18.69%) 77 (18.69%) Tabla 2: La distribución de temperaturas La mayoría de las tareas que hicieron que las personas volvieran a encontrar páginas web (42.75%) y mensajes de correo electrónico (33.33%) implican buscar información que tuvo información que tienese ha accedido en la última semana. Sin embargo, también hubo una serie de tareas de reinicio que implicaron la búsqueda de información anterior: el 23.30% de las tareas registradas (24.00% para el correo electrónico y el 22.90% para la web) implicó la búsqueda de información accedida en el último mes y el 18.69% de las tareasregistrado (24.67% para correo electrónico y 15.27% para la web) buscaban información aún más antigua. Esto es importante con respecto a la evaluación porque existe evidencia psicológica que sugiere que las personas recuerdan menos con el tiempo, p.[23]. Esto significa que los usuarios pueden encontrar más difícil buscar información anterior o tal vez alterar su estrategia de búsqueda al buscar información caliente, cálida o fría.4.2 ¿Qué tareas son difíciles? Buscamos patrones en los datos registrados para determinar si ciertas tareas se percibían como más difíciles que otras. Por ejemplo, examinamos si el tipo de medios afectó lo difícil que los participantes percibieron la tarea. No hubo evidencia de que los participantes encontraran correo electrónico (mediana = 2 IQR = 2) o Web (mediana = 2 IQR = 2) tareas más difíciles. También investigamos si el tipo de tarea o el período de tiempo entre el acceso y el reembolso hicieron que una tarea fuera más difícil. La Figura 1 muestra esta información gráficamente. Figura 1: Calificaciones de dificultad para los tipos de tareas de la Figura 1, no parece que ningún tipo de tarea en particular se percibiera como difícil con respecto a los demás, aunque existe una sugerencia de que las tareas de búsqueda se perciban más difíciles cuando se buscaba información fría que caliente quey las tareas de los elementos se percibieron más difíciles para información cálida que caliente. Para evaluar la relación entre la temperatura de la información y la dificultad percibida, utilizamos las pruebas medias de los estados de ánimo para determinar si el rango de puntajes de dificultad estaba de acuerdo para las temperaturas de la información que se comparaban (p <0.05). Para los datos de tareas de búsqueda, hubo evidencia de que las tareas calientes se percibían más fácilmente que el frío (p = 0.0001) y que las tareas cálidas se percibían más fácilmente que las tareas frías (p = 0.0041), pero no había evidencia para distinguir entre la dificultadCalificaciones de tareas calientes y cálidas (P = 0.593). Para los datos de la tarea del ítem, hubo evidencia de que las tareas calientes y frías se calificaron de manera diferente (p = 0.024), pero no hay evidencia para distinguir entre tareas calientes y cálidas (p = 0.05) o tareas cálidas y frías (P = 0.272). Estas pruebas confirman que el período de tiempo entre acceder y volver a acceder a la información solicitada influyó en cómo los participantes difíciles percibieron la tarea. Sin embargo, la gran cantidad de tareas de todo tipo y temperaturas calificadas por los participantes como fáciles, es decir, <3, sugiere que hay otros factores que influyen en cuán difícil se percibe que es una tarea. Aprender sobre estos factores requeriría el tipo de evaluaciones de usuarios propuestas por [16, 6], el tipo de evaluaciones facilitadas por nuestro trabajo.4.3 Resumen En la primera parte de este documento, describimos un estudio diario de tareas de reinicio web y por correo electrónico. Examinamos los tipos de tareas que hicieron que los participantes registraran sus tiendas personales y encontramos tres categorías principales de tareas: tareas en las que el usuario requiere información específica de un solo recurso, tareas donde se requiere un solo recurso y tareas que requieren informaciónser recuperado de múltiples recursos. Se descubrió que las tareas de búsqueda y elemento se registraron con mayor frecuencia que las tareas de múltiples elementos. Aunque no se encontraron evidencia de que las tareas web o de correo electrónico fueran más difíciles, hubo alguna evidencia que mostrara que el tiempo entre el acceso y el reacio afectó lo difícil que las participantes percibieron las tareas. Estos hallazgos tienen implicaciones para evaluar el comportamiento PIM en el nivel de tarea. El resto de este documento se concentra en esto, discutiendo lo que significan los hallazgos con respecto a realizar evaluaciones de usuarios PIM basadas en tareas.5. Evaluaciones PIM basadas en tareas Los hallazgos descritos en la Sección 4 son útiles con respecto a la evaluación porque proporcionan a los experimentadores suficiente conocimiento para realizar evaluaciones controladas de usuarios en condiciones de laboratorio. Se pueden construir diseños experimentales de greco-latin cuadrado donde a los participantes se les asigna n tareas de los tres tipos descritos anteriormente para realizar en sus propias colecciones utilizando sistemas X. Esto permitiría que el rendimiento de los sistemas o el comportamiento de los participantes que usen diferentes sistemas se analizaran con respecto al tipo de tarea que se realiza (búsqueda, elemento o múltiple ítems). En las siguientes secciones evaluamos la viabilidad de este enfoque al emplear diferentes métodos de creación de tareas.5.1 Uso de tareas reales Un método para crear tareas de reinicio realistas sin comprometer la privacidad de los participantes es usar tareas reales. Los estudios diarios, similares a los descritos anteriormente, permitirían a los experimentadores capturar un grupo de tareas para que los participantes completen buscando en sus propias colecciones. Esto es extremadamente ventajoso porque permitiría a los experimentadores evaluar el comportamiento de los usuarios reales, completando tareas de búsqueda reales en colecciones reales mientras están en un entorno controlado. También existe el beneficio adicional de que las descripciones de tareas no harían suposiciones sobre lo que el usuario recordaría en una situación de la vida real porque solo incluiría la información que se había registrado, es decir, la información disponible cuando el usuario realizó originalmente la tarea. Sin embargo, para obtener estos beneficios debemos, en primer lugar, confirmar que las descripciones de tareas registradas son de calidad suficiente para permitir que la tarea se vuelva a actuar en una fecha posterior. En segundo lugar, debemos asegurarnos de que un estudio diario proporcione a los experimentadores suficientes tareas para construir un diseño experimental equilibrado que satisfaga sus necesidades de datos. Para examinar la calidad de las tareas registradas, 6 semanas después de que el estudio del diario se haya completado, preguntamos a 6 de nuestros participantes, seleccionados al azar del grupo de aquellos que registraron suficientes tareas, que volvieran a realizar 5 de sus propias tareas. Las tareas se seleccionaron al azar desde el grupo de los disponibles. Las tareas emitidas constaban de 10 correo electrónico y 20 tareas web, 9 de las cuales eran tareas de búsqueda, 12 eran tareas de elementos y 8 eran tareas de múltiples elementos. Las tareas emitidas representaban un muestreo amplio del conjunto completo de tareas grabadas. También incluyeron tareas con descripciones vagas, p.• LU5: encuentre una clave de software para una aplicación que necesite para reinstalar.• LU6: Tratando de encontrar una cita para usar en un documento. No puedo recordar que la persona o la cita exacta la utilidad de tales tareas dependería de los recuerdos de los participantes, es decir, la grabadora de la tarea LU5 recordaría a qué aplicación se refirió y el registrador de LU6 recordaría lo suficiente sobre el contexto en el que tuvo lugar la tareapara volver a realizar la tarea? Presentado con las tareas exactamente como las registraron, se les pidió a los participantes que volvieran a realizar cada tarea con cualquier sistema de su elección. De las 30 tareas emitidas, 26 (86.67%) se completaron sin problemas, 2 (6.67%) de las tareas no se completaron porque la descripción registrada era insuficiente para recrear la tarea y 2 tareas (6.67%) no se completaron porque laLa tarea era demasiado difícil o la página web requerida ya no existía. Es probable que los experimentadores estén interesados en el grupo final de tareas porque es importante descubrir qué dificulta la tarea y cómo el comportamiento del usuario cambia en estas circunstancias. Por lo tanto, a partir de las 30 tareas probadas, solo 2 tareas no eran de calidad suficiente para ser utilizadas en una situación de evaluación. Además, no parecía haber ningún problema del tipo, las calificaciones de temperatura o dificultad que afectan la calidad de las descripciones de las tareas. Estos hallazgos sugieren que los participantes que registraron la mayoría de las tareas en el estudio del diario también registraron tareas con suficiente calidad. Sin embargo, ¿el estudio del diario generó suficientes tareas para satisfacer las necesidades de los experimentadores?

Desde las Tablas 3 y 4, que muestran las cantidades de correo electrónico y tareas web registradas para cada participante, podemos ver que los de 36 participantes, solo 13 (36.1%) registraron 5 o más tareas de correo electrónico y 20 (55.6%) registrados 5 oMás tareas web. Esto significa que muchos de los participantes reclutados no podrían participar en la evaluación final. Esta es una limitación importante del uso de tareas registradas en las evaluaciones porque el reclutamiento de los participantes para las pruebas de usuario es un desafío y puede que no sea posible reclutar suficientes participantes si los experimentadores pierden entre la mitad y dos tercios de sus poblaciones. Además, hubo cierto desequilibrio en el número de tareas registradas de diferentes tipos. Algunos participantes registraron varias tareas de búsqueda, pero muy pocas tareas de elementos y otras grabaron varias tareas de elementos, pero pocas tareas de búsqueda. También hubo una falta específica de tareas de correo electrónico de múltiples elementos. Esta situación hace que sea muy difícil para los experimentadores preparar diseños experimentales equilibrados. Por lo tanto, a pesar de que nuestra primera prueba sugiere que la calidad de las tareas registradas fue suficiente para que los participantes vuelvan a realizar las tareas en una etapa posterior, el número de tareas registradas fue probablemente demasiado baja para hacer de esta una opción viable para la creación de tareas experimentales. Sin embargo, puede ser posible aumentar el número de tareas registradas con frecuentemente recordando a los participantes o realizando visitas personales, etc. 5.2 utilizando tareas simuladas basadas en tareas reales Otro beneficio de los estudios del diario es que proporcionan información sobre los contenidos y usos de los usos privadoscolecciones sin invadir la privacidad de los participantes. Esta sección explora la posibilidad de utilizar una combinación del conocimiento obtenido de los estudios diarios y otros atributos conocidos sobre los participantes para crear artificialmente tareas de reinicio correspondientes a la taxonomía definida en la Sección 4.1. Explicamos las técnicas utilizadas y demostramos la viabilidad de crear tareas simuladas dentro del contexto de una evaluación de usuarios que investiga el comportamiento de reinicio del correo electrónico. Las limitaciones de espacio nos impiden informar nuestros hallazgos;En cambio, nos concentramos en los métodos de creación de tareas. Como preparación para la evaluación, realizamos un segundo estudio diario, donde 34 nuevos participantes, que constan de 16 estudiantes de posgrado y 18 estudiantes de subgrado, registraron 150 tareas de correo electrónico durante un período de aproximadamente 3 semanas. Los datos recopilados revelaron varios patrones que ayudaron con la creación de tareas artificiales. Por ejemplo, los estudiantes de ambos grupos registraron tareas relacionadas con clases que estaban tomando en ese momento y, a menudo, diferentes participantes registraron tareas que implicaban buscar la misma información. Esto fue útil porque nos proporcionó una pista de que, aunque algunos de los participantes no registraron una tarea en particular, era posible que la tarea aún fuera aplicable a sus colecciones. Otros patrones revelados incluyeron que los estudiantes dentro del mismo grupo a menudo buscaban correos electrónicos que contenían anuncios de la misma fuente. Por ejemplo, varios estudiantes de pregrado registraron tareas que incluían la reinicio de la información relacionada con las vacantes de empleo. También hubo tareas que fueron registradas por los participantes en ambos grupos. Por ejemplo, la búsqueda de un correo electrónico que vuelva a confirmar el código PIN requerido para acceder a los laboratorios de computación. Para complementar nuestro conocimiento de las colecciones de correo electrónico de los participantes, pedimos a 2 participantes de cada grupo que proporcionen recorridos por correo electrónico. Estos consistieron en breves sesiones de 5-10 minutos, donde se les pidió a los participantes que explicaran por qué usan el correo electrónico, quién les envía correo electrónico y sus estrategias organizativas. Este enfoque se ha utilizado con éxito en el pasado como un medio no intrusivo para aprender sobre cómo las personas almacenan y mantienen su información personal [17]. Originalmente, habíamos planeado pedir a más participantes que proporcionaran giras, pero encontramos que 2 tours por grupo eran suficientes para nuestras necesidades. Nuevamente, surgieron patrones que ayudaron con la creación de tareas. Encontramos el contenido superpuesto dentro y entre grupos que confirmaron muchas de nuestras observaciones de los datos del estudio del diario. Por ejemplo, los estudiantes que dieron giras revelaron que recibieron correos electrónicos de profesores para tareas de clase particulares, recibos para tareas completadas y varios anuncios de soporte de sistemas y vacantes de empleo. Es importante destacar que los participantes también pudieron confirmar qué otros estudiantes habían recibido la misma información. Esto confirmó que muchas de las tareas registradas durante el estudio del diario eran aplicables, no solo para la grabadora, sino para cada participante en 1 o ambos grupos. Según este trabajo de investigación inicial, se creó un conjunto de 15 tareas (5 de cada tipo en nuestra taxonomía) para cada grupo de participantes. También creamos un conjunto de tareas para un tercer grupo de participantes que consistían en miembros de la investigación y el personal académico, basado en nuestro conocimiento de los correos electrónicos que reciben nuestros colegas. Cuando sea posible, utilizamos la información registrada en las descripciones del estudio del diario para proporcionar un contexto para la tarea, es decir, una tarea de trabajo o motivación que requeriría que se realice la tarea. Cuando los datos del estudio del diario no proporcionaron información de contexto suficiente para proporcionar a los participantes una descripción robusta de la necesidad de la información, creamos situaciones de tareas de trabajo simuladas de acuerdo con las directrices de [2]. Una ventaja adicional del uso de tareas simuladas de esta manera, en lugar de tareas reales, es que algunos de los usuarios no habrán realizado la tarea en el pasado reciente y esto permite el examen de tareas que buscan información de diferentes temperaturas. Si solo se hubieran utilizado tareas reales, todos los participantes habrían realizado las tareas durante el período del estudio del diario. Las tareas creadas se utilizaron en una evaluación final, donde examinamos el comportamiento de reinicio del correo electrónico de los usuarios con tres sistemas de correo electrónico diferentes.21 usuarios (7 en cada grupo) realizaron 9 tareas cada una (1 tarea de cada tipo en cada sistema) utilizando sus propias colecciones personales en un diseño experimental de greco-latina cuadrada. Realizar una evaluación PIM de esta manera permitió el examen del comportamiento de reinicio de una manera que no era posible antes: pudimos observar las estrategias de reinfección de correo electrónico empleadas por usuarios reales, realizando tareas realistas, en sus propias colecciones en un entorno controlado.. El estudio reveló que los participantes recordaron diferentes atributos de correos electrónicos, demostraron diferentes comportamientos de búsqueda y exhibieron diferentes niveles de rendimiento cuando se les pidió que completaran tareas de los diferentes tipos en la taxonomía. La clave tanto para la creación de tareas como para el análisis de los resultados fue nuestra taxonomía, que proporcionó la plantilla para crear tareas y también un medio para comparar el comportamiento y el rendimiento de diferentes usuarios (y sistemas) que realizan diferentes tareas del mismo tipo. Algunos de los hallazgos de la evaluación se publicarán en [10]. Resumiendo el enfoque, para realizar un experimento de usuario utilizando nuestra metodología, los investigadores deberían realizar los siguientes pasos: 1) realizar un estudio de diario como anteriormente 1.2) Analice las tareas registradas que buscan superposición entre los participantes.3) Complementar el conocimiento adquirido sobre el contenido de las colecciones de los participantes pidiendo a una selección de los participantes que proporcionen un recorrido por su colección.4) Use el conocimiento obtenido para idear tareas de los tres tipos diferentes definidos dentro de la taxonomía. Se puede encontrar más información DE1 sobre esto y los formularios de diario requeridos en http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/pimevaluations información sobre cómo usar la investigación descrita en este documento para realizar PIM basados en tareasLas evaluaciones se pueden encontrar en nuestro sitio web (ver nota 1).6. Conclusiones Este documento se ha centrado en superar las dificultades involucradas en la realización de evaluaciones PIM. La naturaleza personal de PIM significa que es difícil construir experimentos equilibrados porque los participantes tienen sus propias colecciones únicas que se autogeneran al completar otras tareas. Sugerimos que para incorporar los aspectos personales de PIM en las evaluaciones, el rendimiento de los sistemas o usuarios debe examinarse cuando los usuarios completen tareas en sus propias colecciones. Este enfoque en sí mismo tiene problemas porque la creación de tareas para colecciones personales es difícil: los investigadores no saben mucho sobre los tipos de tareas de reinicio que las personas realizan y no saben qué información hay dentro de las colecciones personales individuales. En este artículo describimos formas de superar estos desafíos para facilitar las evaluaciones de los usuarios PIM basadas en tareas. En la primera parte del documento realizamos un estudio de diario que examinó las tareas que hicieron que las personas volvieran a encontrar mensajes de correo electrónico y páginas web. Los datos recopilados incluyeron una amplia gama de tareas relacionadas con el trabajo y no laboral, y en base a los datos creamos una taxonomía de las tareas de reinicio de Web y Correo electrónico. Descubrimos que las personas realizan tres tipos principales de tareas de reinicio: tareas que requieren información específica de un solo recurso, tareas que requieren un solo recurso completo y tareas que requieren que la información se recupere de múltiples recursos. En la segunda parte del documento, discutimos la importancia de la taxonomía con respecto a la evaluación PIM. Demostramos que los experimentos equilibrados podrían realizarse comparando el sistema o el rendimiento del usuario en las categorías de tareas dentro de la taxonomía. También sugerimos dos métodos para crear tareas que se pueden completar en colecciones personales. Estos métodos no comprometen la privacidad de los participantes del estudio. Examinamos las técnicas sugeridas, en primer lugar, simulando una situación experimental: se les pidió a los participantes que volvieran a realizar sus propias tareas mientras las registraban y, en segundo lugar, en el contexto de una evaluación completa. Realizar evaluaciones de esta manera permitirá que los sistemas que se han propuesto mejorar la capacidad de los usuarios para administrar y volver a encontrar su información para que se pruebe, para que podamos aprender sobre las necesidades y deseos de los usuarios. Por lo tanto, este documento ha ofrecido dos contribuciones al campo: una mayor comprensión del comportamiento PIM en el nivel de tarea y un método de evaluación que facilitará más investigaciones.7.

        "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
        "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
        "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
        "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
        "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
        "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
        "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
        "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
        "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
        "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
        "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
        "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
        "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
        "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
        "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
        "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
        "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
        "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
        "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
        "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
        "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
        "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
        "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
        "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
        "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
        "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
        "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
        "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
        "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
        "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
        "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
        "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
        "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
        "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
        "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
        "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
        "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
        "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
        "A few methods have been proposed.",
        "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
        "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
        "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
        "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
        "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
        "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
        "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
        "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
        "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
        "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
        "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
        "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
        "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
        "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
        "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
        "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
        "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
        "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
        "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
        "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
        "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
        "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
        "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
        "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
        "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
        "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
        "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
        "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
        "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
        "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
        "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
        "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
        "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
        "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
        "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
        "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
        "The following sections present the findings.",
        "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
        "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
        "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
        "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
        "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
        "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
        "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
        "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
        "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
        "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
        "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
        "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
        "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
        "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
        "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
        "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
        "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
        "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
        "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
        "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
        "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
        "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
        "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
        "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
        "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
        "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
        "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
        "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
        "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
        "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
        "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
        "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
        "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
        "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
        "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
        "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
        "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
        "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
        "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
        "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
        "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
        "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
        "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
        "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
        "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
        "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
        "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
        "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
        "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
        "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
        "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
        "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
        "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
        "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
        "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
        "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
        "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
        "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
        "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
        "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
        "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
        "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
        "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
        "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
        "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
        "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
        "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
        "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
        "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
        "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
        "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
        "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
        "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
        "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
        "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
        "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
        "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
        "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
        "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
        "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
        "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
        "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
        "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
        "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
        "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
        "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
        "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
        "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
        "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
        "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
        "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
        "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
        "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
        "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
        "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
        "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
        "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
        "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
        "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
        "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
        "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
        "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
        "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
        "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
        "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
        "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
        "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
        "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
        "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
        "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
        "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
        "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
        "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
        "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
        "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
        "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
        "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
        "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
        "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
        "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
        "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
        "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
        "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
        "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
        "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
        "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
        "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
        "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
        "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
        "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
        "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
        "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
        "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
        "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
        "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
        "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",
        "More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6.",
        "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
        "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
        "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
        "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
        "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
        "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
        "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
        "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
        "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
        "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
        "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
        "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
        "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
        "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
        "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",

                "This has been noted by several scholars and explained by the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The difficulties include that people re-find information from within unique personal collections; researchers know little about the tasks that cause people to re-find information; and numerous privacy issues concerning personal information.",
                "In this paper we aim to facilitate PIM evaluations by addressing each of these difficulties.",

                "INTRODUCTION <br>personal information management</br> (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",

                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
                "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
                "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
                "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
                "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
                "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",
                "More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
                "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",

                "INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations.",
                "In the first part of this paper we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks.",

                "Thus, this paper offers two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
                "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
                "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
                "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
                "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
                "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",
                "More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
                "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",

                "INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations.",

                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an <br>experimenter</br> to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the <br>experimenter</br> can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The <br>experimenter</br> ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
                "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
                "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
                "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
                "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
                "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",
                "More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
                "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",

                "INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations.",

                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
                "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
                "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
                "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
                "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
                "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",
                "More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
                "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",

                "A feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users manage and <br>re-find information</br>, but very few have been evaluated.",
                "This has been noted by several scholars and explained by the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The difficulties include that people <br>re-find information</br> from within unique personal collections; researchers know little about the tasks that cause people to <br>re-find information</br>; and numerous privacy issues concerning personal information.",
                "In this paper we aim to facilitate PIM evaluations by addressing each of these difficulties.",
                "In the first part, we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks.",
                "The study examines the kind of tasks that require users to <br>re-find information</br> and produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and web pages.",

                "INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and <br>re-find information</br>.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations.",
                "In the first part of this paper we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks.",
                "The study examines the kind of tasks that require users to <br>re-find information</br> and produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and web pages.",
                "We also look at the features of the tasks that make re-finding difficult.",
                "In the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using different methods of task creation.",
                "Thus, this paper offers two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or <br>re-find information</br> that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
                "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
                "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
                "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
                "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",

                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",

                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
                "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",

                "INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations.",
                "In the first part of this paper we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks.",
                "The study examines the kind of tasks that require users to re-find information and produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and web pages.",
                "We also look at the features of the tasks that make re-finding difficult.",
                "In the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using different methods of task creation.",
                "Thus, this paper offers two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that <br>privacy issue</br>s were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
                "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
                "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
                "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
                "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
                "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",

                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
                "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",

                "INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations.",
                "In the first part of this paper we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks.",

                "We also look at the features of the tasks that make re-finding difficult.",
                "In the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using different methods of task creation.",
                "Thus, this paper offers two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task <br>taxonomy</br> provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent <br>taxonomy</br> exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the <br>taxonomy</br>, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
                "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
                "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
                "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
                "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the <br>taxonomy</br> defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our <br>taxonomy</br>) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the <br>taxonomy</br>.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our <br>taxonomy</br>, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
                "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the <br>taxonomy</br>.",
                "More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a <br>taxonomy</br> of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the <br>taxonomy</br> with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the <br>taxonomy</br>.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
                "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",

                "INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of <br>individual collection</br>s.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations.",

                "Thus, this paper offers two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
                "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
                "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
                "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
                "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
                "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",
                "More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
                "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",

                "This has been noted by several scholars and explained by the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The difficulties include that people re-find information from within unique personal collections; researchers know little about the tasks that cause people to re-find information; and numerous privacy issues concerning personal information.",

                "INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations.",
                "In the first part of this paper we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks.",

                "We also look at the features of the tasks that make re-finding difficult.",
                "In the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using different methods of task creation.",
                "Thus, this paper offers two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an <br>email message</br> and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
                "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
                "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
                "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
                "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
                "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",
                "More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
                "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",

                "This has been noted by several scholars and explained by the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The difficulties include that people re-find information from within unique personal collections; researchers know little about the tasks that cause people to re-find information; and numerous privacy issues concerning personal information.",

                "INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations.",
                "In the first part of this paper we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks.",
                "The study examines the kind of tasks that require users to re-find information and produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and web pages.",
                "We also look at the features of the tasks that make re-finding difficult.",
                "In the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using different methods of task creation.",
                "Thus, this paper offers two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
                "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
                "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
                "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
                "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
                "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",
                "More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
                "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",

                "This has been noted by several scholars and explained by the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The difficulties include that people re-find information from within unique personal collections; researchers know little about the tasks that cause people to re-find information; and numerous privacy issues concerning personal information.",

                "INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations.",
                "In the first part of this paper we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks.",
                "The study examines the kind of tasks that require users to re-find information and produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and web pages.",
                "We also look at the features of the tasks that make re-finding difficult.",
                "In the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using different methods of task creation.",
                "Thus, this paper offers two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",
                "The remainder were defined as U for unclassifiable.",
                "A cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures is shown in table 2.",
                "Hot Warm Cold Unclass.",
                "Email 50(33.33%) 36(24.00%) 37(24.67%) 27(18%) Web 112(42.75%) 60(22.90%) 40(15.27%) 50(19.08%) All 162(39.32%) 96(23.30%) 77(18.69%) 77(18.69%) Table 2: The distribution of temperatures Most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages (42.75%) and email messages (33.33%) involved searching for information that has been accessed in the last week.",
                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a user evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
                "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",
                "More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",

                "A feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users manage and re-find information, but very few have been evaluated.",
                "This has been noted by several scholars and explained by the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The difficulties include that people re-find information from within unique personal collections; researchers know little about the tasks that cause people to re-find information; and numerous privacy issues concerning personal information.",
                "In this paper we aim to facilitate PIM evaluations by addressing each of these difficulties.",

                "The study examines the kind of tasks that require users to re-find information and produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and web pages.",

                "INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re-find information.",
                "PIM systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are becoming increasingly popular.",
                "However the evaluation of these PIM systems is problematic.",
                "One of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "People collect information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.",
                "This means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is intrinsically linked with the owners personal experiences.",
                "As personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.",
                "Secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an evaluation.",
                "The precise nature of this information - what information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.",
                "Therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled PIM evaluations.",
                "A particular feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].",
                "Recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to address the problem of PIM evaluation.",
                "For example, Kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in PIM, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for laboratory based PIM studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.",
                "Capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled PIM lab evaluations to complement other evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "In this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties involved to faciliate controlled laboratory PIM evaluations.",
                "In the first part of this paper we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks.",
                "The study examines the kind of tasks that require users to re-find information and produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and web pages.",
                "We also look at the features of the tasks that make re-finding difficult.",
                "In the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using different methods of task creation.",
                "Thus, this paper offers two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK A variety of approaches are available to study PIM.",
                "Naturalistic approaches study participants performing naturally, completing their own tasks as they occur, within familiar environments.",
                "These approaches allow researchers to overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal nature of PIM.",
                "As the tasks performed are real and not simulated, the participants can utilise their own experiences, previous knowledge and information collections to complete the tasks.",
                "A benefit of the approach is that data can be captured continuously over extended time periods and measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these [15].",
                "Naturalistic approaches can be applied by conducting fieldwork [17, 8], ethnographic methods as suggested by [15] or via log file analysis [9, 7].",
                "Both ethnographic and fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter to assess how PIM is performed, which raises a number of issues.",
                "Firstly, evaluation in this way is expensive; taking long time periods to study small numbers of participants and these small samples may not be representative of the behaviour of larger populations.",
                "Secondly, because participants cannot be continually observed, experimenters must choose when to observe and this may affect the findings.",
                "An alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic evaluations is to utilise log file analysis.",
                "This approach makes use of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user activities in the context of natural use of a system.",
                "In [9] a novel PIM search tool was deployed to 234 users and the log data provided detailed information about the nature of user queries, interactions with the query interface and about properties of the items retrieved.",
                "Log file analysis is a powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity of detailed information about how users behave with the system without the expense and distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Nevertheless, there are limitations to this strategy.",
                "Firstly, to attain useful results, the deployed prototype must be something that people would use i.e. it has to be a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement on the systems ordinarily available to participants.",
                "Developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the resources of many researchers.",
                "Further, caution must be taken when analysing logs, as the captured data shows nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the time.",
                "It is, therefore, difficult to make any concrete statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the logs.",
                "This reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies with controlled experiments where the experimenter can relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated with known search tasks.",
                "Laboratory-based studies simulate users real world environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory, offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and narrow in scope.",
                "One difficulty in performing this kind of evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate.",
                "Kelly [16] proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would provide sharable, reusable data sets, tasks and metrics for those interested in conducting PIM research.",
                "This may be useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to TREC in mainstream IR [13].",
                "However, a shared collection would be unsuitable for user studies because it would not be possible to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM while using a common, unfamiliar collection.",
                "One alternative approach is to ask users to provide their own information collections to simulate familiar environments within the lab.",
                "This approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal photographs [11], email messages [20], and web-bookmarks [21].",
                "The usefulness of this approach depends on how easy it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access.",
                "Another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when studying web page re-finding [4].",
                "This may be appropriate for studying web page re-finding because previous studies have shown that people often use web search engines for this purpose [5].",
                "A second difficulty in performing PIM laboratory studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be solved by searching a shared or personal collection.",
                "Tasks relate to the activity that results in a need for information [14] and are acknowledged to be important in determining user behaviour [26].",
                "A large body of work has been carried out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of task influences user information seeking behaviour.",
                "For example, tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing complexity [3] and task complexity has been suggested to affect how searchers perceive their information needs [25] and how they try to find information [3].",
                "Other previous work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour [2].",
                "However, little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause people to search their personal stores or re-find information that they have seen before.",
                "Consequently, it is difficult to devise simulated work task situations for PIM.",
                "The exception is the study of personal photograph management, where Roddens work on categorising personal photograph search tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task situations [22].",
                "There have been other suggestions as to how to classify PIM tasks.",
                "For example, [5] asked participants to classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the location of the sought after information and several scholars have classified information objects by the frequency of their use e.g. [24].",
                "While these are interesting properties that may affect how a task will be performed, they do not give experimenters enough scope to devise tasks.",
                "Personal collections are one reason why task creation is so difficult.",
                "Roddens photo task taxonomy provides a solution here because it allows tasks, tailored to private collections to be categorised.",
                "Systems can then be compared across task types for different users [11].",
                "Unfortunately, no equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object.",
                "Further, other types of object are more sensitive to privacy than photographs; it is unlikely that participants would be as content to allow researchers to browse their email collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in [11].",
                "This presents a serious problem - how can researchers devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or jeopardising the privacy of study participants?",
                "A few methods have been proposed.",
                "For example, [20] studied email search by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent to every member in a department; allowing the same tasks to be used for all of the study participants.",
                "This approach ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants could use things that they remember to complete tasks.",
                "Nevertheless, the systems were only tested using one type of task - participants were asked to find single emails, each of which shared common properties.",
                "In section 4 we show that people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than this.",
                "In [4], generic search tasks were artificially created by running evaluations over two sessions.",
                "In the first session, participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved finding some unknown information.",
                "In the second session, participants completed the same tasks again, which naturally involved some re-finding behaviour.",
                "The limitations of this technique are that it does not allow participants to exploit any personal connections with the information because the information they are looking for may not correspond to any other aspect of their lives.",
                "Further, if time is utilised by a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable because all of the objects found in the first session will have been accessed within the same time period.",
                "Our review of evaluation approaches motivates a requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested.",
                "Unfortunately, it has also been shown that there are difficulties involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to private collections, while at the same time protect the privacy of the study participants.",
                "In the following section we present a diary study of refinding tasks for email and web pages.",
                "The outcome is a classification of tasks similar to that devised by Rodden for personal photographs [22].",
                "In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task-based PIM user evaluations.",
                "We show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries, not only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find personal information, but we can learn about the contents of private collections without compromising the privacy of the participants.",
                "This knowledge can then be used to construct tasks for use in PIM evaluations. 3.",
                "METHOD Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting, without the distracting influence of an observer.",
                "Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19]. [12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be limited, however, with careful design and good implementation.",
                "In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.",
                "To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.",
                "By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels maintained.",
                "The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.",
                "Web forms were deployed rather than paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.",
                "The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are performing.",
                "This description was to contain both the information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.",
                "To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.",
                "The experimenter ensured that the participants understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.",
                "The examples were supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.",
                "The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).",
                "Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought after information.",
                "Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).",
                "Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be. 36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The final population consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.",
                "The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.",
                "As both personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 4.",
                "RESULTS Several analyses were performed on the captured data.",
                "The following sections present the findings.",
                "Firstly, we examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both when searching on email and on the web.",
                "Next, we consider the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were performed most often by participants.",
                "Lastly, we explore the kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as difficult. 4.1 Nature of Web and Email Re-finding Tasks During the study 412 tasks were recorded. 150 (36.41%) of these tasks were email based, 262 (63.59%) were webbased.",
                "As with most diary studies, the number of tasks recorded varied extensively between particpants.",
                "The median number of tasks per participant was 8 (interquartile range (IQR)=9.5).",
                "More web tasks (median=5,IQR=7.5) were recorded than email tasks (median=3, IQR=3).",
                "This means that on average each participant recorded approximately one task every two days.",
                "From the descriptions supplied by the participants, we found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email and web re-finding.",
                "Based on this observation a joint classification scheme was devised, encompassing both email and web tasks.",
                "The tasks were classified as one of three types: lookup tasks, item tasks and multi-item tasks.",
                "Lookup tasks involve searching for specific information from within a resource, for example an email or a web page, where the resource may or may not be known.",
                "Some recorded examples of lookup tasks were: • LU1: Looking for the course code for a class - its used in a script that is run to set up a practical.",
                "Id previously obtained this about 3 weeks ago from our website. • LU2: I am trying to determine the date by which I step down as an External Examiner.",
                "This is in an email somewhere • LU3: Looking for description of log format from system R developed for student project.",
                "I think he sent me in it an email Item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web page, perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire contents are needed to complete the task.",
                "Some recorded examples of item tasks were: • I1: Looking for SIGIR 2002 paper to give to another student • I2: Find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to claim expenses • I3: I need the peer evaluation forms for the MIA class E sent me them by email To clarify, lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways - in the quantity of information required and in what the user knows about what they are looking for.",
                "Lookup tasks involve a need for a small piece of information e.g. a phone number or an ingredient, and the user may or may not know exactly the resource that contains this information.",
                "In item tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking for and needs the entire contents of that resource.",
                "Multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that was contained within numerous web pages or email messages.",
                "Often these tasks required the user to process or collate the information in order to solve the task.",
                "Some recorded examples were: • MI1: Looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist John Fowles, who died at the weekend.",
                "Accessed the online Guradian and IMES • MI2: Trying to find details on Piccolo graphics framework.",
                "Remind myself of what it is and what it does.",
                "Looking to build a GUI within Eclipse • MI3: I am trying to file my emails regarding IPM and I am looking for any emails from or about this journal There were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify.",
                "For example, consider the following recorded task: • LU4: re-find ASs paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub-tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).",
                "It was decided to treat this as a lookup task because the users ultimate goal was to access and use the information within the resource.",
                "There were a number of examples of combined tasks, mainly of the form item then lookup, but there were also examples of item then multi-item.",
                "For example: • MI4: re-find Kelkoo website so that I can re-check the prices of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend A second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as finding an email containing a URL as a means of re-accessing a web page.",
                "It was also decided to categorise these as lookup tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants as email searches and, within this context, what they were looking for was information within an email.",
                "Another problem was that some of the logs lacked the detail required to perform a categorisation e.g. • U1: searching for how to retrieve users selection from a message box.",
                "Decided to use some other means Such tasks were labelled as U for unclassifiable.",
                "To verify the consistency of the taxonomy, the tasks were recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks.",
                "The agreement between the results of the two analyses was largely consistent (96.8%).",
                "Further, we asked a researcher with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a sample of 50 tasks.",
                "The second researcher achieved a 90% agreement.",
                "We feel that this high agreement on a large number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence for the reliability of the classification scheme.",
                "The distribution of task types is shown in table 1.",
                "Overall, lookup and item tasks were the most common, with multiitem tasks only representing 8.98% of those recorded.",
                "The distribution of the task types was different for web and email re-finding.",
                "The majority of email tasks (60%) involved looking for information within an email (lookup), in contrast to web tasks where the majority of tasks (52.67%) involved looking for a single web page (item).",
                "Another distinction was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and email.",
                "Multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding (only 2.67% of email tasks involved searching for multiple resources), but comparatively common for web re-finding (12.6%).",
                "Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass.",
                "Email 90(60%) 52(34.67%) 4(2.67%) 4(2.67%) Web 87(33.21%) 138(52.67%) 33(12.60%) 4(1.53%) All 177(42.96%) 190(46.12%) 37(8.98%) 8(1.94%) Table 1: The distribution of task types In addition to the three-way classification described above, the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the temperature metaphor proposed by [24], which classifies information as one of three temperatures: hot, warm and cold.",
                "We classified the tasks using the form data.",
                "Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.",
                "Unfortunately, a technical difficulty with the form only allowed 335(81.3%) of the tasks to be classified.",

                "However there were also a number of re-finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.",
                "This is important with respect to evaluation because there is psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over time e.g. [23].",
                "This means that users may find searching for older information more difficult or perhaps alter their seeking strategy when looking for hot, warm or cold information. 4.2 What tasks are difficult?",
                "We looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than others.",
                "For example, we examined whether the media type affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be.",
                "There was no evidence that participants found either email (median=2 IQR=2) or web (median=2 IQR=2) tasks more difficult.",
                "We also investigated whether the type of task or the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made a task more difficult.",
                "Figure 1 shows this information graphically.",
                "Figure 1: Difficulty ratings for task types From figure 1, it does not appear that any particular task type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others, although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm information than hot.",
                "To assess the relationship between information temperature and the perceived difficulty, we used Moods median tests to determine whether the rank of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information temperatures being compared (p<0.05).",
                "For the look-up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).",
                "For the item task data, there was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently (p=0.024), but no evidence to distinguish between hot and warm tasks(p=0.05) or warm and cold tasks(p=0.272).",
                "These tests confirm that the length of time between accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to be.",
                "Nevertheless, the large number of tasks of all types and temperatures rated by participants as easy i.e. < 3, suggests that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task is perceived to be.",
                "To learn about these factors would require the kind of user evaluations proposed by [16, 6] - the kind of evaluations facilitated by our work. 4.3 Summary In the first part of this paper, we described a diary study of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We examined the types of task that caused the participants to search their personal stores and found three main categories of task: tasks where the user requires specific information from within a single resource, tasks where a single resource is required, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "It was discovered that look-up and item tasks were recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks.",
                "Although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were more difficult, there was some evidence showing that the time between accessing and re-accessing affected how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.",
                "These findings have implications for evaluating PIM behaviour at the task level.",
                "The remainder of this paper concentrates on this, discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing task-based PIM user evaluations. 5.",
                "TASK-BASED PIM EVALUATIONS The findings described in section 4 are useful with respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in lab conditions.",
                "Greco-Latin square experimental designs can be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the three types described above to perform on their own collections using x systems.",
                "This would allow the performance of the systems or the behaviour of the participants using different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task being performed (look-up, item, or multi-item).",
                "In the following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach when employing different methods of task creation. 5.1 Using Real Tasks One method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks.",
                "Diary-studies, similar to that described above, would allow experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants to complete by searching on their own collections.",
                "This is extremely advantageous because it would allow experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users, completing real search tasks on real collections while in a controlled environment.",
                "There is also the additional benefit that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions about what the user would remember in a real life situation because they would only include the information that had been recorded i.e. the information that was available when the user originally performed the task.",
                "Nevertheless, to gain these benefits we must, firstly, confirm that the task descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the task to be re-performed at a later date.",
                "Secondly, we must ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design that would satisfy their data needs.",
                "To examine the quality of recorded tasks, 6 weeks after the diary study had completed, we asked 6 of our participants, selected randomly from the pool of those who recorded enough tasks, to re-perform 5 of their own tasks.",
                "The tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those available.",
                "The issued tasks consisted of 10 email and 20 web tasks, 9 of which were lookup tasks, 12 were item tasks, and 8 were multi-item tasks.",
                "The issued tasks represented a broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks.",
                "They also included tasks with vague descriptions e.g. • LU5:Find a software key for an application I required to reinstall. • LU6:Trying to find a quote to use in a paper.",
                "Cannot remember the person or the exact quote The usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of participants i.e. would the recorder of task LU5 remember which application he referred to and would the recorder of LU6 remember enough about the context in which the task took place to re-perform the task?",
                "Presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them, the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any system of their choice.",
                "Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.",
                "Experimenters are likely to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user behaviour changes in these circumstances.",
                "Therefore, from the 30 tasks tested, only 2 tasks were not of sufficient quality to be used in an evaluation situation.",
                "Further, there did not seem to be any issue of the type, temperature or difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions.",
                "These findings suggest that the participants who recorded most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with sufficient quality.",
                "However, did the diary study generate enough tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters?",
                "Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 10 26 16 8 2 0 43 9 4 5 0 0 26 9 5 4 0 0 8 9 8 1 0 0 40 8 5 3 0 0 18 7 3 4 0 0 4 6 5 1 0 0 7 6 5 0 1 0 12 5 4 0 0 1 22 5 4 1 0 0 36 5 0 5 0 0 46 5 2 2 0 1 3 5 3 2 0 0 Table 3: The quantities of recorded email tasks Participant Tasks Lookup Item Multi-item Unclass. 26 32 7 20 5 0 32 31 11 18 2 0 10 19 0 10 7 2 33 18 5 13 0 0 5 15 0 7 2 4 8 11 0 6 5 0 22 10 0 3 5 2 28 10 1 7 2 0 37 10 1 9 0 0 35 9 7 2 0 0 6 9 0 1 8 0 40 7 1 5 1 0 9 7 0 0 5 2 12 7 1 0 3 2 42 6 0 4 2 0 29 6 0 3 3 0 15 5 0 2 1 2 4 5 0 4 1 0 43 5 2 3 0 0 18 5 0 0 3 2 Table 4: The quantities of recorded web tasks Naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform a <br>user evaluation</br> will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the number of users and the number of systems to be tested etc.",
                "However, for illustrative purposes we chose 5 tasks as a cut-off point for our data.",
                "From tables 3 and 4, which show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each participant, we can see that of the 36 participants, only 13 (36.1%) recorded 5 or more email tasks and 20 (55.6%) recorded 5 or more web tasks.",
                "This means that many of the recruited participants could not actually participate in the final evaluation.",
                "This is a major limitation of using recorded tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit enough participants if experimenters lose between half and two-thirds of their populations.",
                "Further, there was some imbalance in the numbers of recorded tasks of different types.",
                "Some participants recorded several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks.",
                "There was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks.",
                "This situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare balanced experimental designs.",
                "Therefore, even though our first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later stage, the number of tasks recorded was probably too low to make this a viable option for experimental task creation.",
                "However, it may be possible to increase the number of tasks recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making personal visits etc. 5.2 Using Simulated Tasks Based on Real Tasks Another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide information about the contents and uses of private collections without invading participants privacy.",
                "This section explores the possibility of using a combination of the knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section 4.1.",
                "We explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of creating simulated tasks within the context of a <br>user evaluation</br> investigating email re-finding behaviour.",
                "Space limitations prevent us from reporting our findings; instead we concentrate on the methods of task creation.",
                "As preparation for the evaluation, we performed a second diary-study, where 34 new participants, consisting of 16 post-graduate students and 18 under-graduate students, recorded 150 email tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.",
                "The collected data revealed several patterns that helped with the creation of artificial tasks.",
                "For example, students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes that they were taking at the time and often different participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same information.",
                "This was useful because it provided us with a clue that even though some of the participants did not record a particular task, it was possible that the task may still be applicable to their collections.",
                "Other patterns revealed included that students within the same group often searched for emails containing announcements from the same source.",
                "For example, several undergraduate students recorded tasks that included re-finding information relating to job vacancies.",
                "There were also tasks that were recorded by participants in both groups.",
                "For example, searching for an email that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the computer labs.",
                "To supplement our knowledge of the participants email collections, we asked 2 participants from each group to provide email tours.",
                "These consisted of short 5-10 minute sessions, where participants were asked to explain why they use email, who sends them email, and their organisational strategies.",
                "This approach has been used successfully in the past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people store and maintain their personal information [17].",
                "Originally, we had planned to ask more participants to provide tours, but we found 2 tours per group was sufficient for our needs.",
                "Again, patterns emerged that helped with task creation.",
                "We found content overlap within and between groups that confirmed many of our observations from the diary study data.",
                "For example, the students who gave tours revealed that they received emails from lecturers for particular class assignments, receipts for completed assignments, and various announcements from systems support and about job vacancies.",
                "Importantly, the participants were also able to confirm which other students had received the same information.",
                "This confirmed that many of tasks recorded during the diary study were applicable, not only to the recorder, but to every participant in 1 or both groups.",
                "Based on this initial investigatory work, a set of 15 tasks (5 of each type in our taxonomy) was created for each group of participants.",
                "We also created a set of tasks for a third group of participants that consisted of research and academic staff members, based on our knowledge of the emails our colleagues receive.",
                "Where possible we used the information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide a context for the task i.e. a work task or motivation that would require the task to be performed.",
                "When the diary study data did not provide sufficient context information to supply the participants with a robust description of the information need, we created simulated work task situations according to the guidelines of [2].",
                "A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real-tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.",
                "If only real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have performed the tasks during the period of the diary study.",
                "The created tasks were used in a final evaluation, where we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with three different email systems. 21 users (7 in each group) performed 9 tasks each (1 task of each type on each system) using their own personal collections in a Greco-Latin square experimental design.",
                "Performing a PIM evaluation in this way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a way not possible before - we were able to observe the email re-finding strategies employed by real users, performing realistic tasks, on their own collections in a controlled environment.",
                "The study revealed that the participants remembered different attributes of emails, demostrated different finding behaviour, and exhibited different levels of performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types in the taxonomy.",
                "The key to both the task creation and the analysis of the results was our taxonomy, which provided the template to create tasks and also a means to compare the behaviour and performance of different users (and systems) performing different tasks of the same type.",
                "Some of the findings of the evaluation will be published in [10].",
                "Summarising the approach, to conduct a user experiment using our methodology, researchers would be required to perform the following steps: 1)Conduct a diary study as above 1 . 2)Analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap between the participants. 3)Supplement the gained knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their collection. 4)Use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the three different types defined within the taxonomy.",
                "More de1 Information about this and the diary forms required can be found at http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/˜dce/PIMevaluations tailed information on how to use the research described in this paper to perform task-based PIM evaluations can be found at our website (see footnote 1). 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.",
                "The personal nature of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced experiments because participants each have their own unique collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.",
                "We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users should be examined when users complete tasks on their own collections.",
                "This approach itself has problems because task creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers dont know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people perform and they dont know what information is within individual personal collections.",
                "In this paper we described ways of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.",
                "In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email messages and web pages.",
                "The collected data included a wide range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding tasks.",
                "We discovered that people perform three main types of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information from within a single resource, tasks that require a single complete resource, and tasks that require information to be recovered from multiple resources.",
                "In the second part of the paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with respect to PIM evaluation.",
                "We demonstrated that balanced experiments could be conducted comparing system or user performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.",
                "We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can be completed on personal collections.",
                "These methods do not compromise the privacy of study participants.",
                "We examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the context of a full evaluation.",
                "Performing evaluations in this way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve users ability to manage and re-find their information to be tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires of users.",
                "Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 7.",
