Lyu Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering The Chinese University of Hong Kong Shatin, NT, Hong Kong {hxyang,king,lyu}@cse.cuhk.edu.hk ABSTRACT While the PageRank algorithm has proven to be very effective for ranking Web pages, the rank scores of Web pages can be manipulated. To handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the Web structure, we propose a ranking algorithm called DiffusionRank. DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph. Theoretically we show that DiffusionRank can serve as a generalization of PageRank when the heat diffusion coefficient γ tends to infinity. In such a case 1/γ = 0, DiffusionRank (PageRank) has low ability of anti-manipulation. When γ = 0, DiffusionRank obtains the highest ability of anti-manipulation, but in such a case, the web structure is completely ignored. Consequently, γ is an interesting factor that can control the balance between the ability of preserving the original Web and the ability of reducing the effect of manipulation. It is found empirically that, when γ = 1, DiffusionRank has a Penicillin-like effect on the link manipulation. Moreover, DiffusionRank can be employed to find group-to-group relations on the Web, to divide the Web graph into several parts, and to find link communities. Experimental results show that the DiffusionRank algorithm achieves the above mentioned advantages as expected.

INTRODUCTION While the PageRank algorithm [13] has proven to be very effective for ranking Web pages, inaccurate PageRank results are induced because of web page manipulations by people for commercial interests. The manipulation problem is also called the Web spam, which refers to hyperlinked pages on the World Wide Web that are created with the intention of misleading search engines [7]. It is reported that approximately 70% of all pages in the .biz domain and about 35% of the pages in the .us domain belong to the spam category [12]. The reason for the increasing amount of Web spam is explained in [12]: some web site operators try to influence the positioning of their pages within search results because of the large fraction of web traffic originating from searches and the high potential monetary value of this traffic. From the viewpoint of the Web site operators who want to increase the ranking value of a particular page for search engines, Keyword Stuffing and Link Stuffing are being used widely [7, 12]. From the viewpoint of the search engine managers, the Web spam is very harmful to the users evaluations and thus their preference to choosing search engines because people believe that a good search engine should not return irrelevant or low-quality results. There are two methods being employed to combat the Web spam problem. Machine learning methods are employed to handle the keyword stuffing. To successfully apply machine learning methods, we need to dig out some useful textual features for Web pages, to mark part of the Web pages as either spam or non-spam, then to apply supervised learning techniques to mark other pages. For example, see [5, 12]. Link analysis methods are also employed to handle the link stuffing problem. One example is the TrustRank [7], a link-based method, in which the link structure is utilized so that human labelled trusted pages can propagate their trust scores trough their links. This paper focuses on the link-based method. The rest of the materials are organized as follows. In the next section, we give a brief literature review on various related ranking techniques. We establish the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) on various cases in Section 3, and propose DiffusionRank in Section 4. In Section 5, we describe the data sets that we worked on and the experimental results. Finally, we draw conclusions in Section 6. 2. LITERATURE REVIEW The importance of a Web page is determined by either the textual content of pages or the hyperlink structure or both. As in previous work [7, 13], we focus on ranking methods solely determined by hyperlink structure of the Web graph. All the mentioned ranking algorithms are established on a graph. For our convenience, we first give some notations. Denote a static graph by G = (V, E), where V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}, E = {(vi, vj) | there is an edge from vi to vj}. Ii and di denote the in-degree and the out-degree of page i respectively. 2.1 PageRank The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes [13]. However, the average importance of all readers can be considered as an objective matter. PageRank tries to find such average importance based on the Web link structure, which is considered to contain a large amount of statistical data. The Web is modelled by a directed graph G in the PageRank algorithms, and the rank or importance xi for page vi ∈ V is defined recursively in terms of pages which point to it: xi = (j,i)∈E aijxj, where aij is assumed to be 1/dj if there is a link from j to i, and 0 otherwise. Or in matrix terms, x = Ax. When the concept of random jump is introduced, the matrix form is changed to x = [(1 − α)g1T + αA]x, (1) where α is the probability of following the actual link from a page, (1 − α) is the probability of taking a random jump, and g is a stochastic vector, i.e., 1T g = 1. Typically, α = 0.85, and g = 1 n 1 is one of the standard settings, where 1 is the vector of all ones [6, 13]. 2.2 TrustRank TrustRank [7] is composed of two parts. The first part is the seed selection algorithm, in which the inverse PageRank was proposed to help an expert of determining a good node. The second part is to utilize the biased PageRank, in which the stochastic distribution g is set to be shared by all the trusted pages found in the first part. Moreover, the initial input of x is also set to be g. The justification for the inverse PageRank and the solid experiments support its advantage in combating the Web spam. Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank. 2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed. The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold. From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing. While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena. In a medium, heat always flow from position with high temperature to position with low temperature. Heat kernel is used to describe the amount of heat that one point receives from another point. Recently, the idea of heat kernel on a manifold is borrowed in applications such as dimension reduction [3] and classification [9, 10, 14]. In these work, the input data is considered to lie in a special structure. All the above topics are related to our work. The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3. HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values. In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold. The heat kernel established on the Web graph is considered as the representation of the relationship between Web pages. The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages. Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic. There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal. This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one. This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent. For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix. This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam. The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows. P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11]. Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y. Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input. If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x. Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1. The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0. In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences. A, α and g are the true web structure. While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1]. Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1. TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways. We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank. We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank. Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures. On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period. Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank. This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure. We view all the Web pages as points drawn from a highly complex geometric structure, like a manifold in a high dimensional space. On a manifold, heat can flow from one point to another through the underlying geometric structure in a given time period. Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure. More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection. We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper. In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case. To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case. To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case. Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions. Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y. However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition. This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph. The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj. The value fi(t) describes the heat at node vi at time t, beginning from an initial distribution of heat given by fi(0) at time zero. f(t) (f(0)) denotes the vector consisting of fi(t) (fi(0)). We construct our model as follows. Suppose, at time t, each node i receives M(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from its neighbor j during a period of ∆t. The heat M(i, j, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t and the heat difference fj(t) − fi(t). Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j. Based on this consideration, we assume that M(i, j, t, ∆t) = γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t. As a result, the heat difference at node i between time t + ∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives from all its neighbors. This is formulated as fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = j:(j,i)∈E γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t, (2) where E is the set of edges. To find a closed form solution to Eq. (2), we express it in a matrix form: (f(t + ∆t) − f(t))/∆t = γHf(t), where d(v) denotes the degree of the node v. In the limit ∆t → 0, it becomes d dt f(t) = γHf(t). Solving it, we obtain f(t) = eγtH f(0), especially we have f(1) = eγH f(0), Hij =    −d(vj), j = i, 1, (vj, vi) ∈ E, 0, otherwise, (3) where eγH is defined as eγH = I+γH+ γ2 2! H2 + γ3 3! H3 +· · · . 3.4 On a Directed Graph The above heat diffusion model must be modified to fit the situation where the links between Web pages are directed. On one Web page, when the page-maker creates a link (a, b) to another page b, he actually forces the energy flow, for example, peoples click-through activities, to that page, and so there is added energy imposed on the link. As a result, heat flows in a one-way manner, only from a to b, not from b to a. Based on such consideration, we modified the heat diffusion model on an undirected graph as follows. On a directed graph G, the pipe (vi, vj) is forced by added energy such that heat flows only from vi to vj. Suppose, at time t, each node vi receives RH = RH(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from vj during a period of ∆t. We have three assumptions: (1) RH should be proportional to the time period ∆t; (2) RH should be proportional to the the heat at node vj; and (3) RH is zero if there is no link from vj to vi. As a result, vi will receive j:(vj ,vi)∈E σjfj(t)∆t amount of heat from all its neighbors that points to it. On the other hand, node vi diffuses DH(i, t, ∆t) amount of heat to its subsequent nodes. We assume that: (1) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t. (2) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the the heat at node vi. (3) Each node has the same ability of diffusing heat. This fits the intuition that a Web surfer only has one choice to find the next page that he wants to browse. (4) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be uniformly distributed to its subsequent nodes. The real situation is more complex than what we assume, but we have to make this simple assumption in order to make our model concise. As a result, node vi will diffuse γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat to any of its subsequent nodes, and each of its subsequent node should receive γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat. Therefore σj = γ/dj. To sum up, the heat difference at node vi between time t+∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives, deducted by what it diffuses. This is formulated as fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = −γfi(t)∆t + j:(vj ,vi)∈E γ/djfj(t)∆t. Similarly, we obtain f(1) = eγH f(0), Hij =    −1, j = i, 1/dj, (vj, vi) ∈ E, 0, otherwise. (4) 3.5 On a Random Directed Graph For real world applications, we have to consider random edges. This can be seen in two viewpoints. The first one is that in Eq. (1), the Web graph is actually modelled as a random graph, there is an edge from node vi to node vj with a probability of (1 − α)gj (see the item (1 − α)g1T ), and that the Web graph is predicted by a random graph [15, 16]. The second one is that the Web structure is a random graph in essence if we consider the content similarity between two pages, though this is not done in this paper. For these reasons, the model would become more flexible if we extend it to random graphs. The definition of a random graph is given below. Definition 1. A random graph RG = (V, P = (pij)) is defined as a graph with a vertex set V in which the edges are chosen independently, and for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ |V | the probability of (vi, vj) being an edge is exactly pij. The original definition of random graphs in [4], is changed slightly to consider the situation of directed graphs. Note that every static graph can be considered as a special random graph in the sense that pij can only be 0 or 1. On a random graph RG = (V, P), where P = (pij) is the probability of the edge (vi, vj) exists. In such a random graph, the expected heat difference at node i between time t + ∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the expected heat that it receives from all its antecedents, deducted by the expected heat that it diffuses. Since the probability of the link (vj, vi) is pji, the expected heat flow from node j to node i should be multiplied by pji, and so we have fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = −γ fi(t) ∆t + j:(vj ,vi)∈E γpjifj(t)∆t/RD+ (vj), where RD+ (vi) is the expected out-degree of node vi, it is defined as k pik. Similarly we have f(1) = eγR f(0), Rij =    −1, j = i; pji/RD+ (vj), j = i. (5) When the graph is large, a direct computation of eγR is time-consuming, and we adopt its discrete approximation: f(1) = (I + γ N R)N f(0). (6) The matrix (I+ γ N R)N in Eq. (6) and matrix eγR in Eq. (5) are called Discrete Diffusion Kernel and the Continuous Diffusion Kernel respectively. Based on the Heat Diffusion Models and their solutions, DiffusionRank can be established on undirected graphs, directed graphs, and random graphs. In the next section, we mainly focus on DiffusionRank in the random graph setting. 4. DIFFUSIONRANK For a random graph, the matrix (I + γ N R)N or eγR can measure the similarity relationship between nodes. Let fi(0)= 1, fj(0) = 0 if j = i, then the vector f(0) represent the unit heat at node vi while all other nodes has zero heat. For such f(0) in a random graph, we can find the heat distribution at time 1 by using Eq. (5) or Eq. (6). The heat distribution is exactly the i−th row of the matrix of (I + γ N R)N or eγR . So the ith-row jth-column element hij in the matrix (I + γ∆tR)N or eγR means the amount of heat that vi can receive from vj from time 0 to 1. Thus the value hij can be used to measure the similarity from vj to vi. For a static graph, similarly the matrix (I + γ N H)N or eγH can measure the similarity relationship between nodes. The intuition behind is that the amount h(i, j) of heat that a page vi receives from a unit heat in a page vj in a unit time embodies the extent of the link connections from page vj to page vi. Roughly speaking, when there are more uncrossed paths from vj to vi, vi will receive more heat from vj; when the path length from vj to vi is shorter, vi will receive more heat from vj; and when the pipe connecting vj and vi is wide, the heat will flow quickly. The final heat that vi receives will depend on various paths from vj to vi, their length, and the width of the pipes. Algorithm 1 DiffusionRank Function Input: The transition matrix A; the inverse transition matrix U; the decay factor αI for the inverse PageRank; the decay factor αB for PageRank; number of iterations MI for the inverse PageRank; the number of trusted pages L; the thermal conductivity coefficient γ.

Formally the DiffusionRank is described in Algorithm 1, in which,the element Uij in the inverse transition matrix U is defined to be 1/Ij if there is a link from i to j, and 0 otherwise. This trusted pages selection procedure by inverse PageRank is completely borrowed from TrustRank [7] except for a fix number of the size of the trusted set. Although the inverse PageRank is not perfect in its ability of determining the maximum coverage, it is appealing because of its polynomial execution time and its reasonable intuition-we actually inverse the original link when we try to build the seed set from those pages that point to many pages that in turn point to many pages and so on. In the algorithm, the underlying random graph is set as P = αB · A + (1 − αB) · 1 n · 1n×n, which is induced by the Web graph. As a result, R = −I + P. In fact, the more general setting for DiffusionRank is P = αB ·A+(1−αB)· 1 n ·g·1T . By such a setting, DiffusionRank is a generalization of TrustRank when γ tends to infinity and when g is set in the same way as TrustRank. However, the second part of TrustRank is not adopted by us. In our model, g should be the true teleportation determined by the users browse habits, popularity distribution over all the Web pages, and so on; P should be the true model of the random nature of the World Wide Web. Setting g according to the trusted pages will not be consistent with the basic idea of Heat Diffusion on a random graph. We simply set g = 1 only because we cannot find it without any priori knowledge. Remark. In a social network interpretation, DiffusionRank first recognizes a group of trusted people, who may not be highly ranked, but they know many other people. The initially trusted people are endowed with the power to decide who can be further trusted, but cannot decide the final voting results, and so they are not dictators. 4.2 Advantages Next we show the four advantages for DiffusionRank. 4.2.1 Two closed forms First, its solutions have two forms, both of which are closed form. One takes the discrete form, and has the advantage of fast computing while the other takes the continuous form, and has the advantage of being easily analyzed in theoretical aspects. The theoretical advantage has been shown in the proof of theorem in the next section. (a) Group to Group Relations (b) An undirected graph Figure 1: Two graphs 4.2.2 Group-group relations Second, it can be naturally employed to detect the groupgroup relation. For example, let G2 and G1 denote two groups, containing pages (j1, j2, . . . , js) and (i1, i2, . . . , it), respectively. Then u,v hiu,jv is the total amounts of heat that G1 receives from G2, where hiu,jv is the iu−th row jv−th column element of the heat kernel. More specifically, we need to first set f(0) for such an application as follows. In f(0) = (f1(0), f2(0), . . . , fn(0))T , if i ∈ {j1, j2, . . . , js}, then fi(0) = 1, and 0 otherwise. Then we employ Eq. (5) to calculate f(1) = (f1(1), f2(1), . . . , fn(1))T , finally we sum those fj(1) where j ∈ {i1, i2, . . . , it}. Fig. 1 (a) shows the results generated by the DiffusionRank. We consider five groups-five departments in our Engineering Faculty: CSE, MAE, EE, IE, and SE. γ is set to be 1, the numbers in Fig. 1 (a) are the amount of heat that they diffuse to each other. These results are normalized by the total number of each group, and the edges are ignored if the values are less than 0.000001. The group-to-group relations are therefore detected, for example, we can see that the most strong overall tie is from EE to IE. While it is a natural application for DiffusionRank because of the easy interpretation by the amount heat from one group to another group, it is difficult to apply other ranking techniques to such an application because they lack such a physical meaning. 4.2.3 Graph cut Third, it can be used to partition the Web graph into several parts. A quick example is shown below. The graph in Fig. 1 (b) is an undirected graph, and so we employ the Eq. (3). If we know that node 1 belongs to one community and that node 12 belongs to another community, then we can put one unit positive heat source on node 1 and one unit negative heat source on node 12. After time 1, if we set γ = 0.5, the heat distribution is [0.25, 0.16, 0.17, 0.16, 0.15, 0.09, 0.01, -0.04, -0.18 -0.21, -0.21, -0.34], and if we set γ = 1, it will be [0.17, 0.16, 0.17, 0.16, 0.16, 0.12, 0.02, -0.07, -0.18, -0.22, -0.24, -0.24]. In both settings, we can easily divide the graph into two parts: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} with positive temperatures and {8, 9, 10, 11, 12} with negative temperatures. For directed graphs and random graphs, similarly we can cut them by employing corresponding heat solution. 4.2.4 Anti-manipulation Fourth, it can be used to combat manipulation. Let G2 contain trusted Web pages (j1, j2, . . . , js), then for each page i, v hi,jv is the heat that page i receives from G2, and can be computed by the discrete approximation of Eq. (4) in the case of a static graph or Eq. (6) in the case of a random graph, in which f(0) is set to be a special initial heat distribution so that the trusted Web pages have unit heat while all the others have zero heat. In doing so, manipulated Web page will get a lower rank unless it has strong in-links from the trusted Web pages directly or indirectly. The situation is quite different for PageRank because PageRank is inputindependent as we have shown in Section 3.1. Based on the fact that the connection from a trusted page to a bad page should be weak-less uncross paths, longer distance and narrower pipe, we can say DiffusionRank can resist web spam if we can select trusted pages. It is fortunate that the trusted pages selection method in [7]-the first part of TrustRank can help us to fulfill this task. For such an application of DiffusionRank, the computation complexity for Discrete Diffusion Kernel is the same as that for PageRank in cases of both a static graph and a random graph. This can be seen in Eq. (6), by which we need N iterations and for each iteration we need a multiplication operation between a matrix and a vector, while in Eq. (1) we also need a multiplication operation between a matrix and a vector for each iteration. 4.3 The Physical Meaning of γ γ plays an important role in the anti-manipulation effect of DiffusionRank. γ is the thermal conductivity-the heat diffusion coefficient. If it has a high value, heat will diffuse very quickly. Conversely, if it is small, heat will diffuse slowly. In the extreme case, if it is infinitely large, then heat will diffuse from one node to other nodes immediately, and this is exactly the case corresponding to PageRank. Next, we will interpret it mathematically. Theorem 1. When γ tends to infinity and f(0) is not the zero vector, eγR f(0) is proportional to the stable distribution produced by PageRank. Let g = 1 n 1. By the Perron Theorem [11], we have shown that 1 is the largest eigenvalue of P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA], and that no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1. Let x be the stable distribution, and so Px = x. x is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1. Assume the n − 1 other eigenvalues of P are |λ2| < 1, . . . , |λn| < 1, we can find an invertible matrix S = ( x S1 ) such that S−1 PS =      1 ∗ ∗ ∗ 0 λ2 ∗ ∗ 0 0 ... ∗ 0 0 0 λn      . (7) Since eγR = eγ(−I+P) = S−1      1 ∗ ∗ ∗ 0 eγ(λ2−1) ∗ ∗ 0 0 ... ∗ 0 0 0 eγ(λn−1)      S, (8) all eigenvalues of the matrix eγR are 1, eγ(λ2−1) , . . . , eγ(λn−1) . When γ → ∞, they become 1, 0, . . . , 0, which means that 1 is the only nonzero eigenvalue of eγR when γ → ∞. We can see that when γ → ∞, eγR eγR f(0) = eγR f(0), and so eγR f(0) is an eigenvector of eγR when γ → ∞. On the other hand, eγR x = (I+γR+γ2 2! R2 +γ3 3! R3 +. . .)x = Ix+γRx+γ2 2! R2 x+ γ3 3! R3 x + . . . = x since Rx = (−I + P)x = −x + x = 0, and hence x is the eigenvector of eγR for any γ. Therefore both x and eγR f(0) are the eigenvectors corresponding the unique eigenvalue 1 of eγR when γ → ∞, and consequently x = ceγR f(0). By this theorem, we see that DiffusionRank is a generalization of PageRank. When γ = 0, the ranking value is most robust to manipulation since no heat is diffused and the system is unchangeable, but the Web structure is completely ignored since eγR f(0) = e0R f(0) = If(0) = f(0); when γ = ∞, DiffusionRank becomes PageRank, it can be manipulated easily. We expect an appropriate setting of γ that can balance both. For this, we have no theoretical result, but in practice we find that γ = 1 works well in Section 5. Next we discuss how to determine the number of iterations if we employ the discrete heat kernel. 4.4 The Number of Iterations While we enjoy the advantage of the concise form of the exponential heat kernel, it is better for us to calculate DiffusionRank by employing Eq. (6) in an iterative way. Then the problem about determining N-the number of iterations arises: For a given threshold , find N such that ||((I + γ N R)N − eγR )f(0)|| < for any f(0) whose sum is one. Since it is difficult to solve this problem, we propose a heuristic motivated by the following observations. When R = −I+P, by Eq. (7), we have (I+ γ N R)N = (I+ γ N (−I+ P))N = S−1      1 ∗ ∗ ∗ 0 (1 + γ(λ2−1) N )N ∗ ∗ 0 0 ... ∗ 0 0 0 (1 + γ(λn−1) N )N      S. (9) Comparing Eq. (8) and Eq. (9), we observe that the eigenvalues of (I + γ N R)N − eγR are (1 + γ(λn−1) N )N − eγ(λn−1) . We propose a heuristic method to determine N so that the difference between the eigenvalues are less than a threshold for only positive λs. We also observe that if γ = 1, λ < 1, then |(1+ γ(λ−1) N )N − eγ(λ−1) | < 0.005 if N ≥ 100, and |(1+ γ(λ−1) N )N −eγ(λ−1) | < 0.01 if N ≥ 30. So we can set N = 30, or N = 100, or others according to different accuracy requirements. In this paper, we use the relatively accurate setting N = 100 to make the real eigenvalues in (I + γ N R)N − eγR less than 0.005. 5. EXPERIMENTS In this section, we show the experimental data, the methodology, the setting, and the results. 5.1 Data Preparation Our input data consist of a toy graph, a middle-size realworld graph, and a large-size real-world graph. The toy graph is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The graph below it shows node 1 is being manipulated by adding new nodes A, B, C, . . . such that they all point to node 1, and node 1 points to them all. The data of two real Web graph were obtained from the domain in our institute in October, 2004. The total number of pages found are 18,542 in the middle-size graph, and 607,170 in the large-size graph respectively. The middle-size graph is a subgraph of the large-size graph, and they were obtained by the same crawler: one is recorded by the crawler in its earlier time, and the other is obtained when the crawler stopped. 5.2 Methodology The algorithms we run include PageRank, TrustRank and DiffusionRank. All the rank values are multiplied by the number of nodes so that the sum of the rank values is equal to the number of nodes. By this normalization, we can compare the results on graphs with different sizes since the average rank value is one for any graph after such normalization. We will need value difference and pairwise order difference as comparison measures. Their definitions are listed as follows. Value Difference. The value difference between A = {Ai}n i=1 and B = {Bi}n i=1 is measured as n i=1 |Ai − Bi|. Pairwise Order Difference. The order difference between A and B is measured as the number of significant order differences between A and B. The pair (A[i], A[j]) and (B[i], B[j]) is considered as a significant order difference if one of the following cases happens: both A[i] > [ <]A[j]+0.1 and B[i] ≤ [ ≥]A[j]; both A[i] ≤ [ ≥]A[j] and B[i] > [ < ]A[j] + 0.1.

(b) The approximation tendency to PageRank by DiffusionRank 5.3 Experimental Set-up The experiments on the middle-size graph and the largesize graphs are conducted on the workstation, whose hardware model is Nix Dual Intel Xeon 2.2GHz with 1GB RAM and a Linux Kernel 2.4.18-27smp (RedHat7.3). In calculating DiffusionRank, we employ Eq. (6) and the discrete approximation of Eq. (4) for such graphs. The related tasks are implemented using C language. While in the toy graph, we employ the continuous diffusion kernel in Eq. (4) and Eq. (5), and implement related tasks using Matlab. For nodes that have zero out-degree (dangling nodes), we employ the method in the modified PageRank algorithm [8], in which dangling nodes of are considered to have random links uniformly to each node. We set α = αI = αB = 0.85 in all algorithms. We also set g to be the uniform distribution in both PageRank and DiffusionRank. For DiffusionRank, we set γ = 1. According to the discussions in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4, we set the iteration number to be MB = 100 in DiffusionRank, and for accuracy consideration, the iteration number in all the algorithms is set to be 100. 5.4 Approximation of PageRank We show that when γ tends to infinity, the value differences between DiffusionRank and PageRank tend to zero. Fig. 2 (b) shows the approximation property of DiffusionRank, as proved in Theorem 1, on the toy graph. The horizontal axis of Fig. 2 (b) marks the γ value, and vertical axis corresponds to the value difference between DiffusionRank and PageRank. All the possible trusted sets with L = 1 are considered. For L > 1, the results should be the linear combination of some of these curves because of the linearity of the solutions to heat equations. On other graphs, the situations are similar. 5.5 Results of Anti-manipulation In this section, we show how the rank values change as the intensity of manipulation increases. We measure the intensity of manipulation by the number of newly added points that point to the manipulated point. The horizontal axes of Fig. 3 stand for the numbers of newly added points, and vertical axes show the corresponding rank values of the manipulated nodes. To be clear, we consider all six situations. Every node in Fig. 2 (a) is manipulated respectively, and its 0 50 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 RankoftheManipulatdNode−1 DiffusionRank−Trust 4 PageRank TrustRanl−Trust 4 0 50 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 RankoftheManipulatdNode−2 DiffusionRank−Trust 4 PageRank TrustRanl−Trust 4 0 50 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 RankoftheManipulatdNode−3 DiffusionRank−Trust 4 PageRank TrustRanl−Trust 4 0 50 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 Number of New Added Nodes RankoftheManipulatdNode−4 DiffusionRank−Trust 3 PageRank TrustRanl−Trust 3 0 50 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 Number of New Added Nodes RankoftheManipulatdNode−5 DiffusionRank−Trust 4 PageRank TrustRanl−Trust 4 0 50 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 Number of New Added Nodes RankoftheManipulatdNode−6 DiffusionRank−Trust 4 PageRank TrustRanl−Trust 4 Figure 3: The rank values of the manipulated nodes on the toy graph 200040006000800010000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 Number of New Added Points RankoftheManipulatdNode PageRank DiffusionRank−uniform DiffusionRank0 DiffusionRank1 DiffusionRank2 DiffusionRank3 TrustRank0 TrustRank1 TrustRank2 TrustRank3 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 Number of New Added Points RankoftheManipulatdNode PageRank DiffusionRank TrustRank DiffusionRank−uniform (a) (b) Figure 4: (a) The rank values of the manipulated nodes on the middle-size graph; (b) The rank values of the manipulated nodes on the large-size graph corresponding values for PageRank, TrustRank (TR), DiffusionRank (DR) are shown in the one of six sub-figures in Fig. 3. The vertical axes show which node is being manipulated. In each sub-figure, the trusted sets are computed below. Since the inverse PageRank yields the results [1.26, 0.85, 1.31, 1.36, 0.51, 0.71]. Let L = 1. If the manipulated node is not 4, then the trusted set is {4}, and otherwise {3}. We observe that in all the cases, rank values of the manipulated node for DiffusionRank grow slowest as the number of the newly added nodes increases. On the middle-size graph and the large-size graph, this conclusion is also true, see Fig. 4. Note that, in Fig. 4 (a), we choose four trusted sets (L = 1), on which we test DiffusionRank and TrustRank, the results are denoted by DiffusionRanki and TrustRanki (i = 0, 1, 2, 3 denotes the four trusted set); in Fig. 4 (b), we choose one trusted set (L = 1). Moreover, in both Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. 4 (b), we show the results for DiffusionRank when we have no trusted set, and we trust all the pages before some of them are manipulated. We also test the order difference between the ranking order A before the page is manipulated and the ranking order PA after the page is manipulated. Because after manipulation, the number of pages changes, we only compare the common part of A and PA. This experiment is used to test the stability of all these algorithms. The less the order difference, the stabler the algorithm, in the sense that only a smaller part of the order relations is affected by the manipulation. Figure 5 (a) shows that the order difference values change when we add new nodes that point to the manipulated node. We give several γ settings. We find that when γ = 1, the least order difference is achieved by DiffusionRank. It is interesting to point out that as γ increases, the order difference will increase first; after reaching a maximum value, it will decrease, and finally it tends to the PageRank results. We show this tendency in Fig. 5 (b), in which we choose three different settings-the number of manipulated nodes are 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 respectively. From these figures, we can see that when γ < 2, the values are less than those for PageRank, and that when γ > 20, the difference between PageRank and DiffusionRank is very small. After these investigations, we find that in all the graphs we tested, DiffusionRank (when γ = 1) is most robust to manipulation both in value difference and order difference. The trust set selection algorithm proposed in [7] is effective for both TrustRank and DiffusionRank. 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 5 Number of New Added Points PairwiseOrderDifference PageRank DiffusionRank−Gamma=1 DiffusionRank−Gamma=2 DiffusionRank−Gamma=3 DiffusionRank−Gamma=4 DiffusionRank−Gamma=5 DiffusionRank−Gamma=15 TrustRank 0 5 10 15 20 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 5 Gamma PairwiseOrderDifference DiffusionRank: when added 2000 nodes DiffusionRank: when added 5000 nodes DiffusionRank: when added 10000 nodes PageRank (a) (b) Figure 5: (a) Pairwise order difference on the middle-size graph, the least it is, the more stable the algorithm; (b) The tendency of varying γ 6. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that DiffusionRank is a generalization of PageRank, which is interesting in that the heat diffusion coefficient γ can balance the extent that we want to model the original Web graph and the extent that we want to reduce the effect of link manipulations. The experimental results show that we can actually achieve such a balance by setting γ = 1, although the best setting including varying γi is still under further investigation. This anti-manipulation feature enables DiffusionRank to be a candidate as a penicillin for Web spamming. Moreover, DiffusionRank can be employed to find group-group relations and to partition Web graph into small communities. All these advantages can be achieved in the same computational complexity as PageRank. For the special application of anti-manipulation, DiffusionRank performs best both in reduction effects and in its stability among all the three algorithms. 7.

Lyu. de informática e ingeniería La Universidad China de Hong Kong Shatin, NT, Hong Kong {Hxyang, King, Lyu}@cse.cuhk.edu.hk Resumen, mientras que el algoritmo de PageRank ha demostrado ser muy efectivo para las páginas web de clasificación, el rango, el rangoSe pueden manipular decenas de páginas web. Para manejar el problema de la manipulación y lanzar una nueva visión sobre la estructura web, proponemos un algoritmo de clasificación llamado DiffusionRank. DiffusionRank está motivado por los fenómenos de difusión de calor, que se pueden conectar a la clasificación web porque las actividades fluyen en la web se pueden imaginar como flujo de calor, el enlace de una página a otro puede tratarse como la tubería de un aire acondicionado yEl flujo de calor puede encarnar la estructura del gráfico web subyacente. Teóricamente, mostramos que DiffusionRank puede servir como una generalización de PageRank cuando el coeficiente de difusión de calor γ tiende al infinito. En tal caso 1/γ = 0, DiffusionRank (PageRank) tiene una baja capacidad de anti-manipulación. Cuando γ = 0, DiffusionRank obtiene la mayor capacidad de anti-manipulación, pero en tal caso, la estructura web se ignora por completo. En consecuencia, γ es un factor interesante que puede controlar el equilibrio entre la capacidad de preservar la web original y la capacidad de reducir el efecto de la manipulación. Se encuentra empíricamente que, cuando γ = 1, DiffusionRank tiene un efecto similar a la penicilina sobre la manipulación del enlace. Además, se puede emplear DiffusionRank para encontrar relaciones de grupo a grupo en la web, dividir el gráfico web en varias partes y encontrar comunidades de enlaces. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el algoritmo de DiffusionRank logra las ventajas mencionadas anteriormente como se esperaba.

Introducción Si bien el algoritmo de PageRank [13] ha demostrado ser muy efectivo para clasificar las páginas web, los resultados inexactos de PageRank se inducen debido a las manipulaciones de la página web por personas para intereses comerciales. El problema de manipulación también se llama spam web, que se refiere a páginas hipervínculos en la red mundial que se crean con la intención de motores de búsqueda engañosos [7]. Se informa que aproximadamente el 70% de todas las páginas en el dominio .biz y aproximadamente el 35% de las páginas en el dominio .US pertenecen a la categoría SPAM [12]. La razón de la creciente cantidad de spam web se explica en [12]: algunos operadores de sitios web intentan influir en el posicionamiento de sus páginas dentro de los resultados de búsqueda debido a la gran fracción del tráfico web que se originan en las búsquedas y el valor monetario de alto potencial de esto.tráfico. Desde el punto de vista de los operadores del sitio web que desean aumentar el valor de clasificación de una página en particular para los motores de búsqueda, el relleno de palabras clave y el relleno de enlaces se están utilizando ampliamente [7, 12]. Desde el punto de vista de los administradores de motores de búsqueda, el spam web es muy perjudicial para las evaluaciones de los usuarios y, por lo tanto, su preferencia de elegir motores de búsqueda porque las personas creen que un buen motor de búsqueda no debe devolver resultados irrelevantes o de baja calidad. Se están empleando dos métodos para combatir el problema del spam web. Se emplean métodos de aprendizaje automático para manejar el relleno de palabras clave. Para aplicar con éxito los métodos de aprendizaje automático, necesitamos cavar algunas características textuales útiles para páginas web, para marcar parte de las páginas web como spam o no spam, luego para aplicar técnicas de aprendizaje supervisadas para marcar otras páginas. Por ejemplo, ver [5, 12]. Los métodos de análisis de enlaces también se emplean para manejar el problema de relleno de enlace. Un ejemplo es el Trustrank [7], un método basado en enlaces, en el que se utiliza la estructura del enlace para que las páginas de confianza etiquetadas por humanos puedan propagar sus puntajes de confianza a través de sus enlaces. Este documento se centra en el método basado en enlaces. El resto de los materiales se organizan de la siguiente manera. En la siguiente sección, damos una breve revisión de la literatura sobre diversas técnicas de clasificación relacionadas. Establecemos el modelo de difusión de calor (HDM) en varios casos en la Sección 3, y proponemos DiffusionRank en la Sección 4. En la Sección 5, describimos los conjuntos de datos en los que trabajamos y los resultados experimentales. Finalmente, sacamos conclusiones en la Sección 6. 2. La revisión de la literatura La importancia de una página web está determinada por el contenido textual de las páginas o la estructura de hipervínculo o ambos. Como en el trabajo anterior [7, 13], nos centramos en los métodos de clasificación determinados únicamente por la estructura de hipervínculos del gráfico web. Todos los algoritmos de clasificación mencionados se establecen en un gráfico. Para nuestra conveniencia, primero damos algunas anotaciones. Denota un gráfico estático por g = (v, e), donde v = {v1, v2 ,..., vn}, e = {(vi, vj) |Hay una ventaja de VI a VJ}. II y DI denotan el engranaje y el grado externo de la página I respectivamente.2.1 PageRank La importancia de una página web es un asunto inherentemente subjetivo, que depende de los intereses, conocimiento y actitudes de los lectores [13]. Sin embargo, la importancia promedio de todos los lectores puede considerarse como un asunto objetivo. PageRank intenta encontrar tal importancia promedio basada en la estructura del enlace web, que se considera que contiene una gran cantidad de datos estadísticos. La Web está modelada por un gráfico G dirigido en los algoritmos de PageRank, y el rango o importancia XI para la página vi ∈ V se define recursivamente en términos de páginas que apuntan a él: xi = (j, i) ∈E aijxj, donde aijse supone que es 1/DJ si hay un enlace de j a i y 0 de lo contrario. O en términos de matriz, x = ax. Cuando se introduce el concepto de salto aleatorio, la forma de la matriz se cambia a x = [(1 - α) G1T + αA] x, (1) donde α es la probabilidad de seguir el enlace real desde una página, (1 - α) es la probabilidad de dar un salto aleatorio, y G es un vector estocástico, es decir, 1t g = 1. Típicamente, α = 0.85 y G = 1 N 1 es una de las configuraciones estándar, donde 1 es el vector de todos [6, 13].2.2 Trustrank Trustrank [7] está compuesto por dos partes. La primera parte es el algoritmo de selección de semillas, en el que se propuso el PageRank inverso para ayudar a un experto a determinar un buen nodo. La segunda parte es utilizar el PageRank sesgado, en el que todas las páginas de confianza se compartan la distribución estocástica G. Además, la entrada inicial de x también está establecida para ser g.La justificación para el PageRank inverso y los experimentos sólidos respaldan su ventaja en la combinación del spam web. Aunque hay muchas variaciones de PageRank, por ejemplo, una familia de algoritmos de clasificación basados en enlaces en [2], Trustrank se elige especialmente para las comparaciones por tres razones: (1) está diseñado para combatir el spam;(2) sus parámetros fijos hacen que una comparación sea fácil;y (3) tiene una fuerte relación teórica con PageRank y DiffusionRank.2.3 Manifold Ranking En [17], se propuso la idea de clasificar en los colectores de datos. Los puntos de datos representados como vectores en el espacio euclidiano se consideran extraídos de un colector. A partir de los puntos de datos en un colector de este tipo, se crea un gráfico ponderado no dirigido, entonces la matriz de peso está dada por el suavizado del núcleo gaussiano. Mientras que el algoritmo de clasificación del colector logra un resultado impresionante en las imágenes de clasificación, el vector sesgado G y el parámetro K en el PageRank personalizado general en [17] son desconocidos en la configuración del gráfico web;Por lo tanto, no lo incluimos en las comparaciones.2.4 Difusión de calor La difusión de calor es un fenómeno físico. En un medio, el fuego siempre fluye de posición con alta temperatura a posición con baja temperatura. El núcleo de calor se usa para describir la cantidad de calor que un punto recibe desde otro punto. Recientemente, la idea del núcleo de calor en un colector se toma prestada en aplicaciones como la reducción de dimensiones [3] y la clasificación [9, 10, 14]. En este trabajo, se considera que los datos de entrada se encuentran en una estructura especial. Todos los temas anteriores están relacionados con nuestro trabajo. Los lectores pueden encontrar que nuestro modelo es una generalización de PageRank para resistir la manipulación web, que heredamos la primera parte de Trustrank, que tomamos prestado el concepto de clasificación en el colector para introducir nuestro modelo, y que la difusión de calor es una principalesquema en este documento.3. Modelo de difusión de calor La difusión de calor nos proporciona otra perspectiva sobre cómo podemos ver la web y también una forma de calcular los valores de clasificación. En este documento, las páginas web se consideran extraídas de un colector desconocido, y la estructura del enlace forma un gráfico dirigido, que se considera una aproximación al colector desconocido. El núcleo de calor establecido en el gráfico web se considera la representación de la relación entre las páginas web. La distribución de temperatura después de un período de tiempo fijo, inducido por una distribución de temperatura inicial especial, se considera los puntajes de rango en las páginas web. Antes de establecer los modelos propuestos, primero mostramos nuestras motivaciones.3.1 Motivaciones Hay dos puntos para explicar que PageRank es susceptible al spam web.• sobredemocrático. Hay una creencia detrás de las páginas de PageRank-All Born es igual. Esto se puede ver desde la capacidad de votación igual de una página: la suma de cada columna es igual a una. Esta capacidad de votación igual de todas las páginas brinda la oportunidad de que un operador del sitio web aumente una página manipulada creando una gran cantidad de páginas nuevas que apuntan a esta página, ya que todas las páginas recién creadas pueden obtener un derecho de votación igual.• Interpretado. Para cualquier entrada inicial no distinta de cero, la iteración convergerá a la misma distribución estable correspondiente al valor propio máximo 1 de la matriz de transición. Esta propiedad independiente de la entrada hace que sea imposible establecer una entrada inicial especial (valores más grandes para páginas de confianza y menos valores incluso valores negativos para páginas spam) para evitar el spam web. La característica independiente de la entrada de PageRank se puede explicar más a continuación. P = [(1 - α) G1T + αA] es una matriz estocástica positiva si G se establece como un vector estocástico positivo (la distribución uniforme es uno de tales entornos), por lo que el valor propio más grande es 1 y ningún otro valor propio cuya valor propio cuya valor propio cuyo mayor valor cuya valor seEl valor absoluto es igual a 1, que está garantizado por el teorema de Perron [11]. Sea y el vector propio correspondiente a 1, entonces tenemos py = y. Sea {xk} la secuencia generada a partir de las iteraciones xk+1 = pxk, y x0 es la entrada inicial. Si {xk} converge a x, entonces xk+1 = pxk implica que x debe satisfacer px = x. Dado que el único valor propio máximo es 1, tenemos x = cy donde c es una constante, y si x e y se normalizan por sus sumas, entonces c = 1. Las discusiones anteriores muestran que PageRank es independiente de la entrada inicial x0. En nuestra opinión, G y α son parámetros objetivos determinados por los comportamientos y preferencias de los usuarios. A, α y G son la verdadera estructura web. Mientras que A se obtiene por un rastreador y la configuración α = 0.85 es aceptada por las personas, creemos que G debe ser determinado por una investigación de comportamiento del usuario, algo así como [1]. Sin ningún conocimiento previo, G debe establecerse como G = 1 N 1. El modelo Trustrank no sigue la verdadera estructura web estableciendo una G sesgada, pero los efectos de combatir el spam se logran en [7];PageRank está, por el contrario, de alguna manera. Esperamos un algoritmo de clasificación que tenga un efecto de la anti-manipulación como Trustrank mientras respeta la verdadera estructura web como PageRank. Observamos que el modelo de difusión de calor es una forma natural de evitar la característica sobredemocrática e independiente de la entrada de PageRank. Dado que el calor siempre fluye desde una posición con temperaturas más altas a una con temperaturas más bajas, los puntos no son iguales, ya que algunos puntos nacen con altas temperaturas, mientras que otros nacen con bajas temperaturas. Por otro lado, las diferentes distribuciones de temperatura inicial darán lugar a diferentes distribuciones de temperatura después de un período de tiempo fijo. Basado en estas consideraciones, proponemos la novela DiffusionRank. Este algoritmo de clasificación también está motivado por el punto de vista de la estructura web. Vemos todas las páginas web como puntos extraídos de una estructura geométrica altamente compleja, como un colector en un espacio de alta dimensión. En un colector, el calor puede fluir de un punto a otro a través de la estructura geométrica subyacente en un período de tiempo dado. Diferentes estructuras geométricas determinan diferentes comportamientos de difusión de calor y, por el contrario, el comportamiento de difusión puede reflejar la estructura geométrica. Más específicamente, en el colector, el calor fluye de un punto a otro punto, y en un período de tiempo dado, si un punto X recibe una gran cantidad de calor desde otro punto y, podemos decir que X e Y están bien conectados, yPor lo tanto, X e Y tienen una alta similitud en el sentido de una alta conexión mutua. Observamos que en un punto con masa unitaria, la temperatura y el calor de este punto son equivalentes, y estos dos términos son intercambiables en este documento. A continuación, primero mostramos el HDM en un colector, que es el origen de HDM, pero no se puede emplear directamente en la red mundial, y por lo tanto se considera el caso ideal. Para conectar el caso ideal y el caso práctico, luego establecemos HDM en un gráfico como caso intermedio. Para modelar el problema del mundo real, construimos aún más HDM en un gráfico aleatorio como un caso práctico. Finalmente demostramos el DiffusionRank que se deriva del HDM en un gráfico aleatorio.3.2 Flujo de calor en un colector conocido Si se conoce el colector subyacente, el flujo de calor a lo largo de un colector geométrico con condiciones iniciales se puede describir mediante la siguiente ecuación diferencial de segundo orden: ∂f (x, t) ∂t - ∆f (x,t) = 0, donde f (x, t) es el calor en la ubicación x en el tiempo t, y ∆f es el operador de laplace-beltrami en una función f.El núcleo de difusión de calor KT (X, Y) es una solución especial a la ecuación de calor con una condición inicial especial: una fuente de calor de la unidad en la posición Y cuando no hay calor en otras posiciones. En base a esto, el núcleo de calor KT (x, y) describe la distribución de calor en el tiempo t difundiendo de la fuente de calor de la unidad inicial en la posición y, y así describe la conectividad (que se considera como un tipo de similitud) entre X e Y. Sin embargo, es muy difícil representar la red mundial como una geometría regular con una dimensión conocida;Incluso se conoce el subyacente, es muy difícil encontrar el núcleo de calor KT (x, y), lo que implica resolver la ecuación de calor con la función delta como condición inicial. Esto nos motiva a investigar el flujo de calor en un gráfico. El gráfico se considera una aproximación al colector subyacente, por lo que el flujo de calor en el gráfico se considera una aproximación al flujo de calor en el colector.3.3 En un gráfico no dirigido en un gráfico no dirigido G, el borde (VI, VJ) se considera una tubería que conecta los nodos VI y VJ. El valor Fi (t) describe el calor en el nodo VI en el tiempo t, comenzando a partir de una distribución inicial del calor dada por Fi (0) en el tiempo cero.f (t) (f (0)) denota el vector que consiste en fi (t) (fi (0)). Construimos nuestro modelo de la siguiente manera. Supongamos, en el momento t, cada nodo I recibe m (i, j, t, ∆t) cantidad de calor de su vecino J durante un período de ∆t. El calor M (I, J, T, ∆T) debe ser proporcional al período de tiempo ∆T y la diferencia de calor FJ (T) - Fi (T). Además, el calor fluye desde el nodo J al nodo I a través de la tubería que conecta los nodos I y J. Según esta consideración, suponemos que M (I, J, T, ∆T) = γ (FJ (T) - Fi (T)) ∆T. Como resultado, la diferencia de calor en el nodo I entre el tiempo t + ∆t y el tiempo t será igual a la suma del calor que recibe de todos sus vecinos. Esto se formula como fi (t + ∆t) - fi (t) = j: (j, i) ∈E γ (fj (t) - fi (t)) ∆t, (2) donde e es el conjunto debordes. Para encontrar una solución de forma cerrada a la ecuación.(2), lo expresamos en forma de matriz: (f (t + ∆t) - f (t))/∆t = γHF (t), donde d (v) denota el grado del nodo v. En elLímite ∆T → 0, se convierte en d dt f (t) = γHF (t). Resolviéndolo, obtenemos f (t) = eγth f (0), especialmente tenemos f (1) = eγh f (0), hij =    −d (vj), j = i, 1, (vj,vi) ∈ E, 0, de lo contrario, (3) donde EγH se define como EγH = I+ γH+ γ2 2! H2 + γ3 3! H3 +· · ·.3.4 En un gráfico dirigido, el modelo de difusión de calor anterior debe modificarse para adaptarse a la situación donde se dirigen los enlaces entre páginas web. En una página web, cuando el fabricante de páginas crea un enlace (a, b) a otra página B, en realidad obliga al flujo de energía, por ejemplo, actividades de clic de las personas, a esa página, por lo que se impone energía adicional impuestaen el enlace. Como resultado, el calor fluye de manera unidireccional, solo de A a B, no de B a A. Según dicha consideración, modificamos el modelo de difusión de calor en un gráfico no dirigido de la siguiente manera. En un gráfico dirigido G, la tubería (VI, VJ) se ve obligada por energía adicional de modo que el calor fluye solo de VI a VJ. Supongamos que en el momento t, cada nodo VI recibe Rh = Rh (I, J, T, ∆T) cantidad de calor de VJ durante un período de ∆T. Tenemos tres suposiciones: (1) Rh debe ser proporcional al período de tiempo ∆T;(2) Hr debe ser proporcional al calor en el nodo VJ;y (3) HR es cero si no hay un enlace de VJ a VI. Como resultado, VI recibirá j: (VJ, vi) ∈E σjfj (t) ∆t Cantidad de calor de todos sus vecinos que lo indican. Por otro lado, el nodo VI difunde DH (i, t, ∆t) cantidad de calor a sus nodos posteriores. Suponemos que: (1) el calor dh (i, t, ∆t) debe ser proporcional al período de tiempo ∆t.(2) El calor dh (i, t, ∆t) debe ser proporcional al calor en el nodo vi.(3) Cada nodo tiene la misma capacidad de difusión de calor. Esto se ajusta a la intuición de que un surfista web solo tiene una opción para encontrar la página siguiente que quiere navegar.(4) El calor DH (I, T, ∆T) debe distribuirse de manera uniforme a sus nodos posteriores. La situación real es más compleja de lo que suponemos, pero tenemos que hacer esta suposición simple para que nuestro modelo sea conciso. Como resultado, el nodo VI difundirá γfi (t) ∆T/DI cantidad de calor a cualquiera de sus nodos posteriores, y cada uno de sus nodos posteriores debería recibir γfi (t) ∆T/DI cantidad de calor. Por lo tanto σj = γ/dj. En resumen, la diferencia de calor en el nodo VI entre el tiempo t+∆t y el tiempo t será igual a la suma del calor que recibe, deducido por lo que difunde. Esto se formula como fi (t + ∆t) - fi (t) = −γfi (t) ∆t + j: (vj, vi) ∈E γ/djfj (t) ∆t. Del mismo modo, obtenemos f (1) = EγH f (0), hij =    −1, j = i, 1/dj, (vj, vi) ∈ E, 0, de lo contrario.(4) 3.5 En un gráfico dirigido aleatorio para aplicaciones del mundo real, debemos considerar los bordes aleatorios. Esto se puede ver en dos puntos de vista. El primero es que en la ecuación.(1), el gráfico web en realidad se modela como un gráfico aleatorio, hay un borde del nodo VI al nodo VJ con una probabilidad de (1 - α) GJ (ver el elemento (1 - α) G1T), y que elEl gráfico web se predice por un gráfico aleatorio [15, 16]. El segundo es que la estructura web es un gráfico aleatorio en esencia si consideramos la similitud de contenido entre dos páginas, aunque esto no se hace en este documento. Por estas razones, el modelo se volvería más flexible si lo extendemos a gráficos aleatorios. La definición de un gráfico aleatorio se da a continuación. Definición 1. Un gráfico aleatorio rg = (v, p = (PIJ)) se define como un gráfico con un conjunto de vértice V en el que los bordes se eligen de forma independiente, y para 1 ≤ I, J ≤ | V |La probabilidad de que (VI, VJ) sea un borde es exactamente PIJ. La definición original de gráficos aleatorios en [4] se cambia ligeramente para considerar la situación de los gráficos dirigidos. Tenga en cuenta que cada gráfico estático puede considerarse como un gráfico aleatorio especial en el sentido de que PIJ solo puede ser 0 o 1. En un gráfico aleatorio rg = (V, P), donde P = (PIJ) es la probabilidad del borde (VI, VJ). En un gráfico tan aleatorio, la diferencia de calor esperada en el nodo I entre el tiempo t + ∆T y el tiempo t será igual a la suma del calor esperado que recibe de todos sus antecedentes, deducido por el calor esperado que difunde. Dado que la probabilidad del enlace (VJ, VI) es PJI, el flujo de calor esperado del nodo J al nodo I debe multiplicarse por PJI, por lo que tenemos fi (t + ∆t) - fi (t) = −γ fi)(t) ∆T+ J: (VJ, VI) ∈E γpjifj (t) ∆T/RD+ (VJ), donde Rd+ (VI) es el grado externo esperado del nodo VI, se define como k pik. Del mismo modo, tenemos f (1) = Eγr f (0), rij =    −1, j = i;PJI/RD+ (VJ), J = i.(5) Cuando el gráfico es grande, un cálculo directo de EγR requiere mucho tiempo, y adoptamos su aproximación discreta: F (1) = (i + γ N R) N F (0).(6) La matriz (i+ γ n r) n en la ecuación.(6) y matriz EγR en la ecuación.(5) se denominan núcleo de difusión discreta y el núcleo de difusión continua respectivamente. Según los modelos de difusión de calor y sus soluciones, DiffusionRank se puede establecer en gráficos no dirigidos, gráficos dirigidos y gráficos aleatorios. En la siguiente sección, nos centramos principalmente en DiffusionRank en la configuración de gráficos aleatorios.4. DiffusionRank Para un gráfico aleatorio, la matriz (i + γ n r) n o eγr puede medir la relación de similitud entre los nodos. Sea Fi (0) = 1, FJ (0) = 0 si J = I, entonces el vector f (0) representa la unidad de calor en el nodo VI, mientras que todos los demás nodos tienen cero calor. Para tal F (0) en un gráfico aleatorio, podemos encontrar la distribución de calor en el tiempo 1 usando la ecuación.(5) o la ecuación.(6). La distribución de calor es exactamente la fila en i - en la matriz de (i + γ n r) n o eγr. Entonces, el elemento de columna JTH-Row Hij en la matriz (i + γ∆TR) N o EγR significa la cantidad de calor que VI puede recibir de VJ de tiempo 0 a 1. Por lo tanto, el valor HJ se puede usar para medir la similitud de VJ a VI. Para un gráfico estático, de manera similar, la matriz (i + γ n h) n o eγH puede medir la relación de similitud entre los nodos. La intuición detrás es que la cantidad h (i, j) de calor que una página VI recibe de una unidad de calor en una página VJ en una unidad de tiempo incorpora la extensión de las conexiones de enlace desde la página VJ a la página VI. En términos generales, cuando hay más caminos no cruzados de VJ a VI, VI recibirá más calor de VJ;Cuando la longitud del camino de VJ a VI es más corta, VI recibirá más calor de VJ;Y cuando la tubería que conecta VJ y VI es amplia, el calor fluirá rápidamente. El calor final que recibe VI dependerá de varios caminos de VJ a VI, su longitud y el ancho de las tuberías. Algoritmo 1 Entrada de la función DiffusionRank: la matriz de transición A;la matriz de transición inversa U;el factor de descomposición αi para el PageRank inverso;el factor de descomposición αB para PageRank;número de iteraciones MI para el PageRank inverso;el número de páginas de confianza L;El coeficiente de conductividad térmica γ.

Formalmente, el rank de difusión se describe en el algoritmo 1, en el que, el elemento UIJ en la matriz de transición inversa U se define como 1/ij si hay un enlace de i a j y 0 de lo contrario. Este procedimiento de selección de páginas de confianza por PageRank inverso está completamente prestado de Trustrank [7], excepto por una solución del tamaño del conjunto de confianza. Aunque el PageRank inverso no es perfecto en su capacidad de determinar la máxima cobertura, es atractivo debido a su tiempo de ejecución polinomial y su intuición razonable, en realidad invertimos el enlace original cuando intentamos construir el conjunto de semillas a partir de esas páginas que apuntan aMuchas páginas que a su vez apuntan a muchas páginas, etc. En el algoritmo, el gráfico aleatorio subyacente se establece como P = αb · A + (1 - αB) · 1 N · 1N × N, que es inducido por el gráfico web. Como resultado, r = −i + P. De hecho, la configuración más general para DiffusionRank es p = αB · A + (1 - αB) · 1 N · G · 1T. Según tal entorno, DiffusionRank es una generalización de Trustrank cuando γ tiende al infinito y cuando G se establece de la misma manera que Trustrank. Sin embargo, la segunda parte de Trustrank no es adoptada por nosotros. En nuestro modelo, G debería ser la verdadera teletransportación determinada por los usuarios de navegación de hábitos, distribución de popularidad en todas las páginas web, etc.;P debe ser el verdadero modelo de la naturaleza aleatoria de la red mundial. Establecer G de acuerdo con las páginas de confianza no será consistente con la idea básica de difusión de calor en un gráfico aleatorio. Simplemente establecemos G = 1 solo porque no podemos encontrarlo sin ningún conocimiento priori. Observación. En una interpretación de la red social, DiffusionRank reconoce por primera vez a un grupo de personas de confianza, que pueden no estar altamente clasificadas, pero conocen a muchas otras personas. Las personas inicialmente confiables están dotadas del poder de decidir en quién se puede confiar más, pero no pueden decidir los resultados finales de votación, por lo que no son dictadores.4.2 Ventajas A continuación, mostramos las cuatro ventajas para DiffusionRank.4.2.1 Dos formas cerradas primero, sus soluciones tienen dos formas, que son de forma cerrada. Uno toma la forma discreta y tiene la ventaja de la computación rápida, mientras que la otra toma la forma continua, y tiene la ventaja de analizarse fácilmente en aspectos teóricos. La ventaja teórica se ha mostrado en la prueba del teorema en la siguiente sección.(a) Las relaciones de grupo a grupo (b) Un gráfico no dirigido Figura 1: Dos gráficos 4.2.2 Relaciones grupales de grupo En segundo lugar, se puede emplear naturalmente para detectar la relación de grupo de grupo. Por ejemplo, dejen que G2 y G1 denoten dos grupos, que contienen páginas (J1, J2, ..., JS) y (I1, I2, ..., It), respectivamente. Entonces U, v Hiu, JV son las cantidades totales de calor que G1 recibe de G2, donde Hiu, JV es el elemento IU -Th. Más específicamente, primero debemos establecer F (0) para dicha aplicación de la siguiente manera. En f (0) = (f1 (0), f2 (0), ..., fn (0)) t, si i ∈ {j1, j2 ,..., js}, luego fi (0) = 1 y 0 de lo contrario. Luego empleamos la ecuación.(5) para calcular f (1) = (f1 (1), f2 (1), ..., fn (1)) t, finalmente sumamos aquellos fj (1) donde j ∈ {i1, i2 ,..., él}. La figura 1 (a) muestra los resultados generados por DiffusionRank. Consideramos cinco grupos de cinco departamentos en nuestra facultad de ingeniería: CSE, Mae, EE, IE y SE.γ se establece para ser 1, los números en la Fig. 1 (a) son la cantidad de calor que se difunden entre sí. Estos resultados se normalizan por el número total de cada grupo, y los bordes se ignoran si los valores son inferiores a 0.000001. Por lo tanto, las relaciones grupales a grupos se detectan, por ejemplo, podemos ver que el empate general más fuerte es de EE a IE. Si bien es una aplicación natural para DiffusionRank debido a la fácil interpretación de la cantidad de calor de un grupo a otro grupo, es difícil aplicar otras técnicas de clasificación a dicha aplicación porque carecen de tal significado físico.4.2.3 Corte de gráfico tercero, se puede usar para dividir el gráfico web en varias partes. A continuación se muestra un ejemplo rápido. El gráfico en la Fig. 1 (b) es un gráfico no dirigido, por lo que empleamos la ecuación.(3). Si sabemos que el nodo 1 pertenece a una comunidad y que el nodo 12 pertenece a otra comunidad, entonces podemos colocar una fuente de calor positiva en el nodo 1 y una fuente de calor negativo de una unidad en el nodo 12. Después del tiempo 1, si establecemos γ = 0.5, la distribución de calor es [0.25, 0.16, 0.17, 0.16, 0.15, 0.09, 0.01, -0.04, -0.18 -0.21, -0.21, -0.34], y si establecemos γ= 1, será [0.17, 0.16, 0.17, 0.16, 0.16, 0.12, 0.02, -0.07, -0.18, -0.22, -0.24, -0.24]. En ambos entornos, podemos dividir fácilmente el gráfico en dos partes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} con temperaturas positivas y {8, 9, 10, 11, 12} con temperaturas negativas. Para gráficos dirigidos y gráficos aleatorios, de manera similar podemos cortarlos empleando la solución de calor correspondiente.4.2.4 Anti-manipulación cuarta, se puede usar para combatir la manipulación. Deje que G2 contenga páginas web confiables (J1, J2, ..., JS), luego para cada página I, v Hi, JV es el calor que recibe de G2, y puede calcularse mediante la aproximación discreta de la ecuación.(4) En el caso de un gráfico estático o la ecuación.(6) En el caso de un gráfico aleatorio, en el que F (0) se establece para ser una distribución de calor inicial especial para que las páginas web de confianza tengan calor unitario, mientras que todos los demás tienen cero calor. Al hacerlo, la página web manipulada obtendrá un rango más bajo a menos que tenga fuertes enlaces en las páginas web de confianza directa o indirectamente. La situación es bastante diferente para PageRank porque PageRank es de Inputindependiente como hemos demostrado en la Sección 3.1. Según el hecho de que la conexión de una página de confianza a una página mala debe ser rutas sin cruce sin cruce, una distancia más larga y tubería más estrecha, podemos decir que DiffusionRank puede resistir el spam web si podemos seleccionar páginas de confianza. Es una suerte que el método de selección de páginas de confianza en [7], la primera parte de Trustrank puede ayudarnos a cumplir esta tarea. Para tal aplicación de DiffusionRank, la complejidad de cálculo para el núcleo de difusión discreta es la misma que para PageRank en casos de un gráfico estático y un gráfico aleatorio. Esto se puede ver en la ecuación.(6), por las cuales necesitamos n iteraciones y para cada iteración necesitamos una operación de multiplicación entre una matriz y un vector, mientras que en la ecuación.(1) También necesitamos una operación de multiplicación entre una matriz y un vector para cada iteración.4.3 El significado físico de γ γ juega un papel importante en el efecto anti-manipulación de DiffusionRank.γ es la conductividad térmica, el coeficiente de difusión de calor. Si tiene un alto valor, el calor se difundirá muy rápidamente. Por el contrario, si es pequeño, el calor se difundirá lentamente. En el caso extremo, si es infinitamente grande, el calor se difundirá de un nodo a otros nodos inmediatamente, y este es exactamente el caso correspondiente a PageRank. A continuación, lo interpretaremos matemáticamente. Teorema 1. Cuando γ tiende al infinito y F (0) no es el vector cero, EγR F (0) es proporcional a la distribución estable producida por PageRank. Sea G = 1 N 1. Por el teorema de Perron [11], hemos demostrado que 1 es el valor propio más grande de p = [(1 - α) G1T + αA], y que ningún otro valor propio cuyo valor absoluto es igual a 1. Sea X la distribución estable, y así px = x.x es el vector propio correspondiente al valor propio 1. Suponga que los otros valores propios de P son | λ2 |<1 ,..., | λn |<1, podemos encontrar una matriz invertible S = (x S1) tal que S - 1 ps =      1 ∗ ∗ ∗ 0 λ2 ∗ ∗ 0 0 ... ∗ 0 0 λn                   .(7) Dado que EγR = Eγ (−i+P) = S - 1      1 ∗ ∗ ∗ 0 Eγ (λ2 - 1) ∗ ∗ 0 0 ... ∗ 0 0 Eγ (λn - 1)     S, (8) Todos los valores propios de la matriz EγR son 1, Eγ (λ2−1) ,..., Eγ (λn - 1). Cuando γ → ∞, se convierten en 1, 0 ,..., 0, lo que significa que 1 es el único valor propio distinto de cero de EγR cuando γ → ∞. Podemos ver que cuando γ → ∞, EγR EγR F (0) = EγR F (0), y así EγR F (0) es un vector propio de EγR cuando γ → ∞. Por otro lado, EγR x = (i+γr+γ2 2! R2 +γ3 3! R3 +...) x = ix+γrx+γ2 2! R2 x+ γ3 3! R3 x +...= x ya que rx = (−i + p) x = −x + x = 0, y por lo tanto x es el vector propio de EγR para cualquier γ. Por lo tanto, tanto X como EγR F (0) son los vectores propios que corresponden al valor propio único de EγR cuando γ → ∞, y en consecuencia x = CeγR F (0). Según este teorema, vemos que DiffusionRank es una generalización de PageRank. Cuando γ = 0, el valor de clasificación es más robusto a la manipulación ya que no se difunde calor y el sistema no cambia, pero la estructura web se ignora por completo ya que eγr F (0) = e0r f (0) = if (0) = f(0);Cuando γ = ∞, DiffusionRank se convierte en PageRank, se puede manipular fácilmente. Esperamos una configuración apropiada de γ que pueda equilibrar ambos. Para esto, no tenemos un resultado teórico, pero en la práctica encontramos que γ = 1 funciona bien en la Sección 5. A continuación, discutimos cómo determinar el número de iteraciones si empleamos el núcleo de calor discreto.4.4 El número de iteraciones Si bien disfrutamos de la ventaja de la forma concisa del núcleo de calor exponencial, es mejor para nosotros calcular DiffusionRank al emplear la ecuación.(6) De una manera iterativa. Luego surge el problema de determinar N-el número de iteraciones: para un umbral dado, encuentre n tal que || ((i + γ n r) n-eγr) f (0) ||<para cualquier f (0) cuya suma es una. Dado que es difícil resolver este problema, proponemos una heurística motivada por las siguientes observaciones. Cuando r = −i+p, por la ecuación.(7), tenemos (i+ γ n r) n = (i+ γ n (−i+ p)) n = s - 1     1 ∗ ∗ ∗ 0 (1+ γ (λ2 - 1) n) n) n)∗ ∗ 0 0 ... ∗ 0 0 0 (1 + γ (λn - 1) n) n      S. (9) Comparación de la ecuación.(8) y la ecuación.(9), observamos que los valores propios de (i + γ n r) n - eγr son (1 + γ (λn - 1) n) n - eγ (λn - 1). Proponemos un método heurístico para determinar N de modo que la diferencia entre los valores propios sea menor que un umbral solo para λs positivos. También observamos que si γ = 1, λ <1, entonces | (1+ γ (λ - 1) n) n - Eγ (λ - 1) |<0.005 si n ≥ 100, y | (1+ γ (λ - 1) n) n −Eγ (λ - 1) |<0.01 si n ≥ 30. Entonces podemos establecer n = 30, o n = 100, u otros de acuerdo con diferentes requisitos de precisión. En este artículo, usamos la configuración relativamente precisa n = 100 para hacer los valores propios reales en (i + γ n r) n - eγr menos de 0.005.5. Experimentos En esta sección, mostramos los datos experimentales, la metodología, la configuración y los resultados.5.1 Preparación de datos Nuestros datos de entrada consisten en un gráfico de juguete, un gráfico RealWorld de tamaño mediano y un gráfico del mundo real de gran tamaño. El gráfico de juguete se muestra en la Fig. 2 (a). El gráfico a continuación muestra que el nodo 1 se está manipulando agregando nuevos nodos A, B, C ,...de tal manera que todos apunten al nodo 1, y el nodo 1 les apunta a todos. Los datos de dos gráficos web reales se obtuvieron del dominio en nuestro instituto en octubre de 2004. El número total de páginas que se encuentran son 18,542 en el gráfico de tamaño medio y 607,170 en el gráfico de gran tamaño respectivamente. El gráfico de tamaño medio es una subgraph del gráfico de tamaño grande, y fueron obtenidos por el mismo rastreador: uno es registrado por el rastreador en su tiempo anterior, y el otro se obtiene cuando el rastreador se detuvo.5.2 Metodología Los algoritmos que ejecutamos incluyen PageRank, Trustrank y DiffusionRank. Todos los valores de rango se multiplican por el número de nodos para que la suma de los valores de rango sea igual al número de nodos. Mediante esta normalización, podemos comparar los resultados en gráficos con diferentes tamaños, ya que el valor de rango promedio es uno para cualquier gráfico después de dicha normalización. Necesitaremos la diferencia de valor y la diferencia de orden por pares como medidas de comparación. Sus definiciones se enumeran de la siguiente manera. Diferencia de valor. La diferencia de valor entre a = {ai} n i = 1 y b = {bi} n i = 1 se mide como n i = 1 | ai - bi |. Diferencia de orden por pares. La diferencia de orden entre A y B se mide como el número de diferencias significativas de orden entre A y B. El par (a [i], a [j]) y (b [i], b [j]) se considera una diferencia de orden significativa si ocurre uno de los siguientes casos: ambos [i]> [<] a[j] +0.1 y b [i] ≤ [≥] a [j];Tanto a [i] ≤ [≥] a [j] como b [i]> [<] a [j] + 0.1.

Al calcular la difusión de Difusión, empleamos la ecuación.(6) y la aproximación discreta de la ecuación.(4) Para tales gráficos. Las tareas relacionadas se implementan utilizando el lenguaje C. Mientras que en el gráfico de juguetes, empleamos el núcleo de difusión continua en la ecuación.(4) y la ecuación.(5) e implementar tareas relacionadas utilizando MATLAB. Para los nodos que tienen cero grados externos (nodos colgantes), empleamos el método en el algoritmo de PageRank modificado [8], en el que se considera que los nodos colgantes tienen enlaces aleatorios de manera uniforme a cada nodo. Establecimos α = αi = αB = 0.85 en todos los algoritmos. También establecemos que G sea la distribución uniforme en PageRank como en DiffusionRank. Para DiffusionRank, establecemos γ = 1. De acuerdo con las discusiones en la Sección 4.3 y la Sección 4.4, establecemos que el número de iteración sea MB = 100 en DiffusionRank, y para consideración de precisión, el número de iteración en todos los algoritmos se establece en 100. 5.4 Aproximación de PageRank, mostramos que cuandoγ tiende al infinito, las diferencias de valor entre DiffusionRank y PageRank tienden a cero. La figura 2 (b) muestra la propiedad de aproximación de DiffusionRank, como se demuestra en el Teorema 1, en el gráfico de juguete. El eje horizontal de la Fig. 2 (b) marca el valor γ, y el eje vertical corresponde a la diferencia de valor entre DiffusionRank y PageRank. Se consideran todos los posibles conjuntos de confianza con L = 1. Para L> 1, los resultados deben ser la combinación lineal de algunas de estas curvas debido a la linealidad de las soluciones a las ecuaciones de calor. En otros gráficos, las situaciones son similares.5.5 Resultados de la anti-manipulación En esta sección, mostramos cómo los valores de rango cambian a medida que aumenta la intensidad de la manipulación. Medimos la intensidad de la manipulación por el número de puntos recién agregados que apuntan al punto manipulado. Los ejes horizontales de la Fig. 3 representan los números de puntos recién agregados, y los ejes verticales muestran los valores de rango correspondientes de los nodos manipulados.

Los ejes verticales muestran qué nodo se está manipulando. En cada subfigura, los conjuntos de confianza se calculan a continuación. Dado que el PageRank inverso produce los resultados [1.26, 0.85, 1.31, 1.36, 0.51, 0.71]. Sea l = 1. Si el nodo manipulado no es 4, entonces el conjunto de confianza es {4}, y de lo contrario {3}. Observamos que en todos los casos, los valores de rango del nodo manipulado para DiffusionRank crecen más lento a medida que aumenta el número de nodos recién agregados. En el gráfico de tamaño medio y el gráfico de gran tamaño, esta conclusión también es cierta, ver Fig. 4. Tenga en cuenta que, en la Fig. 4 (a), elegimos cuatro conjuntos de confianza (l = 1), en los que probamos DiffusionRank y Trustrank, los resultados se denotan por DiffusionRanki y Trustranki (i = 0, 1, 2, 3 denota elcuatro conjuntos de confianza);En la Fig. 4 (b), elegimos un conjunto de confianza (l = 1). Además, tanto en la Fig. 4 (a) como en la Fig. 4 (b), mostramos los resultados para DiffusionRank cuando no tenemos un conjunto de confianza, y confiamos en todas las páginas antes de que algunas sean manipuladas. También probamos la diferencia de orden entre el orden de clasificación A antes de manipular la página y la orden de clasificación PA después de manipular la página. Porque después de la manipulación, el número de páginas cambia, solo comparamos la parte común de A y PA. Este experimento se utiliza para probar la estabilidad de todos estos algoritmos. Cuanto menor sea la diferencia de orden, el establo es el algoritmo, en el sentido de que solo una parte más pequeña de las relaciones de orden se ve afectada por la manipulación. La Figura 5 (a) muestra que los valores de diferencia de orden cambian cuando agregamos nodos nuevos que apuntan al nodo manipulado. Damos varias configuraciones γ. Encontramos que cuando γ = 1, la diferencia de orden menor se logra por DiffusionRank. Es interesante señalar que a medida que aumenta γ, la diferencia de orden aumentará primero;Después de alcanzar un valor máximo, disminuirá y finalmente tiende a los resultados de PageRank. Mostramos esta tendencia en la Fig. 5 (b), en la que elegimos tres configuraciones diferentes: el número de nodos manipulados es 2,000, 5,000 y 10,000 respectivamente. A partir de estas figuras, podemos ver que cuando γ <2, los valores son menores que los de PageRank, y que cuando γ> 20, la diferencia entre PageRank y DiffusionRank es muy pequeña. Después de estas investigaciones, encontramos que en todos los gráficos probamos, DiffusionRank (cuando γ = 1) es más robusto para la manipulación tanto en diferencia de valor como en diferencia de orden. El algoritmo de selección del conjunto de confianza propuesto en [7] es efectivo tanto para Trustrank como para DiffusionRank.0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 5 Número de nuevos puntos Se agregó parewiseRderDifference PageRank DiffusionRank - Gamma = 1 DiffusionRank - Gamma = 2 DiffusionRank - Gamma = 3 DiffusionRank - Gamma = 4 DiFiSuseRank−−−-Gamma = 5 DiffusionRank - Gamma = 15 Trustrank 0 5 10 15 20 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 5 Gamma parewiseRorderDifference DiffusionRank: cuando se agregó 2000 nodos DiffusionRank: cuando se agregan 5000 nodos DiffusionRank: cuando se agregan 10000 nodos Pagerank (A) (B) (B)Figura 5: (a) diferencia de orden por pares en el gráfico de tamaño medio, lo menos es, más estable es el algoritmo;(b) La tendencia de variar γ 6. Conclusiones Concluimos que DiffusionRank es una generalización de PageRank, que es interesante en que el coeficiente de difusión de calor γ puede equilibrar la medida en que queremos modelar el gráfico web original y la medida en que queremos reducir el efecto de las manipulaciones de enlaces. Los resultados experimentales muestran que en realidad podemos lograr tal equilibrio estableciendo γ = 1, aunque la mejor configuración que incluye γi variable todavía está bajo mayor investigación. Esta característica anti-manipulación permite que DiffusionRank sea un candidato como penicilina para el spam web. Además, se puede emplear DiffusionRank para encontrar relaciones grupales de grupos y dividir el gráfico web en pequeñas comunidades. Todas estas ventajas se pueden lograr en la misma complejidad computacional que PageRank. Para la aplicación especial de anti-manipulación, DiffusionRank funciona mejor tanto en efectos de reducción como en su estabilidad entre los tres algoritmos.7.

        "DiffusionRank: A Possible Penicillin for Web Spamming Haixuan Yang, Irwin King, and Michael R. Lyu Dept.",
        "of Computer Science and Engineering The Chinese University of Hong Kong Shatin, NT, Hong Kong {hxyang,king,lyu}@cse.cuhk.edu.hk ABSTRACT While the PageRank algorithm has proven to be very effective for ranking Web pages, the rank scores of Web pages can be manipulated.",
        "To handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the Web structure, we propose a ranking algorithm called DiffusionRank.",
        "DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph.",
        "Theoretically we show that DiffusionRank can serve as a generalization of PageRank when the heat diffusion coefficient γ tends to infinity.",
        "In such a case 1/γ = 0, DiffusionRank (PageRank) has low ability of anti-manipulation.",
        "When γ = 0, DiffusionRank obtains the highest ability of anti-manipulation, but in such a case, the web structure is completely ignored.",
        "Consequently, γ is an interesting factor that can control the balance between the ability of preserving the original Web and the ability of reducing the effect of manipulation.",
        "It is found empirically that, when γ = 1, DiffusionRank has a Penicillin-like effect on the link manipulation.",
        "Moreover, DiffusionRank can be employed to find group-to-group relations on the Web, to divide the Web graph into several parts, and to find link communities.",
        "Experimental results show that the DiffusionRank algorithm achieves the above mentioned advantages as expected.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Search and Retrieval; G2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory General Terms: Algorithms. 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION While the PageRank algorithm [13] has proven to be very effective for ranking Web pages, inaccurate PageRank results are induced because of web page manipulations by people for commercial interests.",
        "The manipulation problem is also called the Web spam, which refers to hyperlinked pages on the World Wide Web that are created with the intention of misleading search engines [7].",
        "It is reported that approximately 70% of all pages in the .biz domain and about 35% of the pages in the .us domain belong to the spam category [12].",
        "The reason for the increasing amount of Web spam is explained in [12]: some web site operators try to influence the positioning of their pages within search results because of the large fraction of web traffic originating from searches and the high potential monetary value of this traffic.",
        "From the viewpoint of the Web site operators who want to increase the ranking value of a particular page for search engines, Keyword Stuffing and Link Stuffing are being used widely [7, 12].",
        "From the viewpoint of the search engine managers, the Web spam is very harmful to the users evaluations and thus their preference to choosing search engines because people believe that a good search engine should not return irrelevant or low-quality results.",
        "There are two methods being employed to combat the Web spam problem.",
        "Machine learning methods are employed to handle the keyword stuffing.",
        "To successfully apply machine learning methods, we need to dig out some useful textual features for Web pages, to mark part of the Web pages as either spam or non-spam, then to apply supervised learning techniques to mark other pages.",
        "For example, see [5, 12].",
        "Link analysis methods are also employed to handle the link stuffing problem.",
        "One example is the TrustRank [7], a link-based method, in which the link structure is utilized so that human labelled trusted pages can propagate their trust scores trough their links.",
        "This paper focuses on the link-based method.",
        "The rest of the materials are organized as follows.",
        "In the next section, we give a brief literature review on various related ranking techniques.",
        "We establish the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) on various cases in Section 3, and propose DiffusionRank in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we describe the data sets that we worked on and the experimental results.",
        "Finally, we draw conclusions in Section 6. 2.",
        "LITERATURE REVIEW The importance of a Web page is determined by either the textual content of pages or the hyperlink structure or both.",
        "As in previous work [7, 13], we focus on ranking methods solely determined by hyperlink structure of the Web graph.",
        "All the mentioned ranking algorithms are established on a graph.",
        "For our convenience, we first give some notations.",
        "Denote a static graph by G = (V, E), where V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}, E = {(vi, vj) | there is an edge from vi to vj}.",
        "Ii and di denote the in-degree and the out-degree of page i respectively. 2.1 PageRank The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes [13].",
        "However, the average importance of all readers can be considered as an objective matter.",
        "PageRank tries to find such average importance based on the Web link structure, which is considered to contain a large amount of statistical data.",
        "The Web is modelled by a directed graph G in the PageRank algorithms, and the rank or importance xi for page vi ∈ V is defined recursively in terms of pages which point to it: xi = (j,i)∈E aijxj, where aij is assumed to be 1/dj if there is a link from j to i, and 0 otherwise.",
        "Or in matrix terms, x = Ax.",
        "When the concept of random jump is introduced, the matrix form is changed to x = [(1 − α)g1T + αA]x, (1) where α is the probability of following the actual link from a page, (1 − α) is the probability of taking a random jump, and g is a stochastic vector, i.e., 1T g = 1.",
        "Typically, α = 0.85, and g = 1 n 1 is one of the standard settings, where 1 is the vector of all ones [6, 13]. 2.2 TrustRank TrustRank [7] is composed of two parts.",
        "The first part is the seed selection algorithm, in which the inverse PageRank was proposed to help an expert of determining a good node.",
        "The second part is to utilize the biased PageRank, in which the stochastic distribution g is set to be shared by all the trusted pages found in the first part.",
        "Moreover, the initial input of x is also set to be g. The justification for the inverse PageRank and the solid experiments support its advantage in combating the Web spam.",
        "Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank. 2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.",
        "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
        "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing.",
        "While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.",
        "In a medium, heat always flow from position with high temperature to position with low temperature.",
        "Heat kernel is used to describe the amount of heat that one point receives from another point.",
        "Recently, the idea of heat kernel on a manifold is borrowed in applications such as dimension reduction [3] and classification [9, 10, 14].",
        "In these work, the input data is considered to lie in a special structure.",
        "All the above topics are related to our work.",
        "The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3.",
        "HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values.",
        "In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold.",
        "The heat kernel established on the Web graph is considered as the representation of the relationship between Web pages.",
        "The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages.",
        "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
        "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
        "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
        "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
        "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
        "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
        "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
        "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
        "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
        "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
        "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
        "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
        "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
        "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
        "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
        "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
        "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
        "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
        "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
        "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
        "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
        "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
        "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
        "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",
        "We view all the Web pages as points drawn from a highly complex geometric structure, like a manifold in a high dimensional space.",
        "On a manifold, heat can flow from one point to another through the underlying geometric structure in a given time period.",
        "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
        "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
        "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
        "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
        "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
        "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
        "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
        "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
        "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
        "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
        "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",
        "The value fi(t) describes the heat at node vi at time t, beginning from an initial distribution of heat given by fi(0) at time zero. f(t) (f(0)) denotes the vector consisting of fi(t) (fi(0)).",
        "We construct our model as follows.",
        "Suppose, at time t, each node i receives M(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from its neighbor j during a period of ∆t.",
        "The heat M(i, j, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t and the heat difference fj(t) − fi(t).",
        "Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j.",
        "Based on this consideration, we assume that M(i, j, t, ∆t) = γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t.",
        "As a result, the heat difference at node i between time t + ∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives from all its neighbors.",
        "This is formulated as fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = j:(j,i)∈E γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t, (2) where E is the set of edges.",
        "To find a closed form solution to Eq. (2), we express it in a matrix form: (f(t + ∆t) − f(t))/∆t = γHf(t), where d(v) denotes the degree of the node v. In the limit ∆t → 0, it becomes d dt f(t) = γHf(t).",
        "Solving it, we obtain f(t) = eγtH f(0), especially we have f(1) = eγH f(0), Hij =    −d(vj), j = i, 1, (vj, vi) ∈ E, 0, otherwise, (3) where eγH is defined as eγH = I+γH+ γ2 2!",
        "H2 + γ3 3!",
        "H3 +· · · . 3.4 On a Directed Graph The above heat diffusion model must be modified to fit the situation where the links between Web pages are directed.",
        "On one Web page, when the page-maker creates a link (a, b) to another page b, he actually forces the energy flow, for example, peoples click-through activities, to that page, and so there is added energy imposed on the link.",
        "As a result, heat flows in a one-way manner, only from a to b, not from b to a.",
        "Based on such consideration, we modified the heat diffusion model on an undirected graph as follows.",
        "On a directed graph G, the pipe (vi, vj) is forced by added energy such that heat flows only from vi to vj.",
        "Suppose, at time t, each node vi receives RH = RH(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from vj during a period of ∆t.",
        "We have three assumptions: (1) RH should be proportional to the time period ∆t; (2) RH should be proportional to the the heat at node vj; and (3) RH is zero if there is no link from vj to vi.",
        "As a result, vi will receive j:(vj ,vi)∈E σjfj(t)∆t amount of heat from all its neighbors that points to it.",
        "On the other hand, node vi diffuses DH(i, t, ∆t) amount of heat to its subsequent nodes.",
        "We assume that: (1) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t. (2) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the the heat at node vi. (3) Each node has the same ability of diffusing heat.",
        "This fits the intuition that a Web surfer only has one choice to find the next page that he wants to browse. (4) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be uniformly distributed to its subsequent nodes.",
        "The real situation is more complex than what we assume, but we have to make this simple assumption in order to make our model concise.",
        "As a result, node vi will diffuse γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat to any of its subsequent nodes, and each of its subsequent node should receive γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat.",
        "Therefore σj = γ/dj.",
        "To sum up, the heat difference at node vi between time t+∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives, deducted by what it diffuses.",
        "This is formulated as fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = −γfi(t)∆t + j:(vj ,vi)∈E γ/djfj(t)∆t.",
        "Similarly, we obtain f(1) = eγH f(0), Hij =    −1, j = i, 1/dj, (vj, vi) ∈ E, 0, otherwise. (4) 3.5 On a Random Directed Graph For real world applications, we have to consider random edges.",
        "This can be seen in two viewpoints.",
        "The first one is that in Eq. (1), the Web graph is actually modelled as a random graph, there is an edge from node vi to node vj with a probability of (1 − α)gj (see the item (1 − α)g1T ), and that the Web graph is predicted by a random graph [15, 16].",
        "The second one is that the Web structure is a random graph in essence if we consider the content similarity between two pages, though this is not done in this paper.",
        "For these reasons, the model would become more flexible if we extend it to random graphs.",
        "The definition of a random graph is given below.",
        "Definition 1.",
        "A random graph RG = (V, P = (pij)) is defined as a graph with a vertex set V in which the edges are chosen independently, and for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ |V | the probability of (vi, vj) being an edge is exactly pij.",
        "The original definition of random graphs in [4], is changed slightly to consider the situation of directed graphs.",
        "Note that every static graph can be considered as a special random graph in the sense that pij can only be 0 or 1.",
        "On a random graph RG = (V, P), where P = (pij) is the probability of the edge (vi, vj) exists.",
        "In such a random graph, the expected heat difference at node i between time t + ∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the expected heat that it receives from all its antecedents, deducted by the expected heat that it diffuses.",
        "Since the probability of the link (vj, vi) is pji, the expected heat flow from node j to node i should be multiplied by pji, and so we have fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = −γ fi(t) ∆t + j:(vj ,vi)∈E γpjifj(t)∆t/RD+ (vj), where RD+ (vi) is the expected out-degree of node vi, it is defined as k pik.",
        "Similarly we have f(1) = eγR f(0), Rij =    −1, j = i; pji/RD+ (vj), j = i. (5) When the graph is large, a direct computation of eγR is time-consuming, and we adopt its discrete approximation: f(1) = (I + γ N R)N f(0). (6) The matrix (I+ γ N R)N in Eq. (6) and matrix eγR in Eq. (5) are called Discrete Diffusion Kernel and the Continuous Diffusion Kernel respectively.",
        "Based on the Heat Diffusion Models and their solutions, DiffusionRank can be established on undirected graphs, directed graphs, and random graphs.",
        "In the next section, we mainly focus on DiffusionRank in the random graph setting. 4.",
        "DIFFUSIONRANK For a random graph, the matrix (I + γ N R)N or eγR can measure the similarity relationship between nodes.",
        "Let fi(0)= 1, fj(0) = 0 if j = i, then the vector f(0) represent the unit heat at node vi while all other nodes has zero heat.",
        "For such f(0) in a random graph, we can find the heat distribution at time 1 by using Eq. (5) or Eq. (6).",
        "The heat distribution is exactly the i−th row of the matrix of (I + γ N R)N or eγR .",
        "So the ith-row jth-column element hij in the matrix (I + γ∆tR)N or eγR means the amount of heat that vi can receive from vj from time 0 to 1.",
        "Thus the value hij can be used to measure the similarity from vj to vi.",
        "For a static graph, similarly the matrix (I + γ N H)N or eγH can measure the similarity relationship between nodes.",
        "The intuition behind is that the amount h(i, j) of heat that a page vi receives from a unit heat in a page vj in a unit time embodies the extent of the link connections from page vj to page vi.",
        "Roughly speaking, when there are more uncrossed paths from vj to vi, vi will receive more heat from vj; when the path length from vj to vi is shorter, vi will receive more heat from vj; and when the pipe connecting vj and vi is wide, the heat will flow quickly.",
        "The final heat that vi receives will depend on various paths from vj to vi, their length, and the width of the pipes.",
        "Algorithm 1 DiffusionRank Function Input: The transition matrix A; the inverse transition matrix U; the decay factor αI for the inverse PageRank; the decay factor αB for PageRank; number of iterations MI for the inverse PageRank; the number of trusted pages L; the thermal conductivity coefficient γ.",

        "Formally the DiffusionRank is described in Algorithm 1, in which,the element Uij in the inverse transition matrix U is defined to be 1/Ij if there is a link from i to j, and 0 otherwise.",
        "This trusted pages selection procedure by inverse PageRank is completely borrowed from TrustRank [7] except for a fix number of the size of the trusted set.",
        "Although the inverse PageRank is not perfect in its ability of determining the maximum coverage, it is appealing because of its polynomial execution time and its reasonable intuition-we actually inverse the original link when we try to build the seed set from those pages that point to many pages that in turn point to many pages and so on.",
        "In the algorithm, the underlying random graph is set as P = αB · A + (1 − αB) · 1 n · 1n×n, which is induced by the Web graph.",
        "As a result, R = −I + P. In fact, the more general setting for DiffusionRank is P = αB ·A+(1−αB)· 1 n ·g·1T .",
        "By such a setting, DiffusionRank is a generalization of TrustRank when γ tends to infinity and when g is set in the same way as TrustRank.",
        "However, the second part of TrustRank is not adopted by us.",
        "In our model, g should be the true teleportation determined by the users browse habits, popularity distribution over all the Web pages, and so on; P should be the true model of the random nature of the World Wide Web.",
        "Setting g according to the trusted pages will not be consistent with the basic idea of Heat Diffusion on a random graph.",
        "We simply set g = 1 only because we cannot find it without any priori knowledge.",
        "Remark.",
        "In a social network interpretation, DiffusionRank first recognizes a group of trusted people, who may not be highly ranked, but they know many other people.",
        "The initially trusted people are endowed with the power to decide who can be further trusted, but cannot decide the final voting results, and so they are not dictators. 4.2 Advantages Next we show the four advantages for DiffusionRank. 4.2.1 Two closed forms First, its solutions have two forms, both of which are closed form.",
        "One takes the discrete form, and has the advantage of fast computing while the other takes the continuous form, and has the advantage of being easily analyzed in theoretical aspects.",
        "The theoretical advantage has been shown in the proof of theorem in the next section. (a) Group to Group Relations (b) An undirected graph Figure 1: Two graphs 4.2.2 Group-group relations Second, it can be naturally employed to detect the groupgroup relation.",
        "For example, let G2 and G1 denote two groups, containing pages (j1, j2, . . . , js) and (i1, i2, . . . , it), respectively.",
        "Then u,v hiu,jv is the total amounts of heat that G1 receives from G2, where hiu,jv is the iu−th row jv−th column element of the heat kernel.",
        "More specifically, we need to first set f(0) for such an application as follows.",
        "In f(0) = (f1(0), f2(0), . . . , fn(0))T , if i ∈ {j1, j2, . . . , js}, then fi(0) = 1, and 0 otherwise.",
        "Then we employ Eq. (5) to calculate f(1) = (f1(1), f2(1), . . . , fn(1))T , finally we sum those fj(1) where j ∈ {i1, i2, . . . , it}.",
        "Fig. 1 (a) shows the results generated by the DiffusionRank.",
        "We consider five groups-five departments in our Engineering Faculty: CSE, MAE, EE, IE, and SE. γ is set to be 1, the numbers in Fig. 1 (a) are the amount of heat that they diffuse to each other.",
        "These results are normalized by the total number of each group, and the edges are ignored if the values are less than 0.000001.",
        "The group-to-group relations are therefore detected, for example, we can see that the most strong overall tie is from EE to IE.",
        "While it is a natural application for DiffusionRank because of the easy interpretation by the amount heat from one group to another group, it is difficult to apply other ranking techniques to such an application because they lack such a physical meaning. 4.2.3 Graph cut Third, it can be used to partition the Web graph into several parts.",
        "A quick example is shown below.",
        "The graph in Fig. 1 (b) is an undirected graph, and so we employ the Eq. (3).",
        "If we know that node 1 belongs to one community and that node 12 belongs to another community, then we can put one unit positive heat source on node 1 and one unit negative heat source on node 12.",
        "After time 1, if we set γ = 0.5, the heat distribution is [0.25, 0.16, 0.17, 0.16, 0.15, 0.09, 0.01, -0.04, -0.18 -0.21, -0.21, -0.34], and if we set γ = 1, it will be [0.17, 0.16, 0.17, 0.16, 0.16, 0.12, 0.02, -0.07, -0.18, -0.22, -0.24, -0.24].",
        "In both settings, we can easily divide the graph into two parts: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} with positive temperatures and {8, 9, 10, 11, 12} with negative temperatures.",
        "For directed graphs and random graphs, similarly we can cut them by employing corresponding heat solution. 4.2.4 Anti-manipulation Fourth, it can be used to combat manipulation.",
        "Let G2 contain trusted Web pages (j1, j2, . . . , js), then for each page i, v hi,jv is the heat that page i receives from G2, and can be computed by the discrete approximation of Eq. (4) in the case of a static graph or Eq. (6) in the case of a random graph, in which f(0) is set to be a special initial heat distribution so that the trusted Web pages have unit heat while all the others have zero heat.",
        "In doing so, manipulated Web page will get a lower rank unless it has strong in-links from the trusted Web pages directly or indirectly.",
        "The situation is quite different for PageRank because PageRank is inputindependent as we have shown in Section 3.1.",
        "Based on the fact that the connection from a trusted page to a bad page should be weak-less uncross paths, longer distance and narrower pipe, we can say DiffusionRank can resist web spam if we can select trusted pages.",
        "It is fortunate that the trusted pages selection method in [7]-the first part of TrustRank can help us to fulfill this task.",
        "For such an application of DiffusionRank, the computation complexity for Discrete Diffusion Kernel is the same as that for PageRank in cases of both a static graph and a random graph.",
        "This can be seen in Eq. (6), by which we need N iterations and for each iteration we need a multiplication operation between a matrix and a vector, while in Eq. (1) we also need a multiplication operation between a matrix and a vector for each iteration. 4.3 The Physical Meaning of γ γ plays an important role in the anti-manipulation effect of DiffusionRank. γ is the thermal conductivity-the heat diffusion coefficient.",
        "If it has a high value, heat will diffuse very quickly.",
        "Conversely, if it is small, heat will diffuse slowly.",
        "In the extreme case, if it is infinitely large, then heat will diffuse from one node to other nodes immediately, and this is exactly the case corresponding to PageRank.",
        "Next, we will interpret it mathematically.",
        "Theorem 1.",
        "When γ tends to infinity and f(0) is not the zero vector, eγR f(0) is proportional to the stable distribution produced by PageRank.",
        "Let g = 1 n 1.",
        "By the Perron Theorem [11], we have shown that 1 is the largest eigenvalue of P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA], and that no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1.",
        "Let x be the stable distribution, and so Px = x. x is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1.",
        "Assume the n − 1 other eigenvalues of P are |λ2| < 1, . . . , |λn| < 1, we can find an invertible matrix S = ( x S1 ) such that S−1 PS =      1 ∗ ∗ ∗ 0 λ2 ∗ ∗ 0 0 ... ∗ 0 0 0 λn      . (7) Since eγR = eγ(−I+P) = S−1      1 ∗ ∗ ∗ 0 eγ(λ2−1) ∗ ∗ 0 0 ... ∗ 0 0 0 eγ(λn−1)      S, (8) all eigenvalues of the matrix eγR are 1, eγ(λ2−1) , . . . , eγ(λn−1) .",
        "When γ → ∞, they become 1, 0, . . . , 0, which means that 1 is the only nonzero eigenvalue of eγR when γ → ∞.",
        "We can see that when γ → ∞, eγR eγR f(0) = eγR f(0), and so eγR f(0) is an eigenvector of eγR when γ → ∞.",
        "On the other hand, eγR x = (I+γR+γ2 2!",
        "R2 +γ3 3!",
        "R3 +. . . )x = Ix+γRx+γ2 2!",
        "R2 x+ γ3 3!",
        "R3 x + . . . = x since Rx = (−I + P)x = −x + x = 0, and hence x is the eigenvector of eγR for any γ.",
        "Therefore both x and eγR f(0) are the eigenvectors corresponding the unique eigenvalue 1 of eγR when γ → ∞, and consequently x = ceγR f(0).",
        "By this theorem, we see that DiffusionRank is a generalization of PageRank.",
        "When γ = 0, the ranking value is most robust to manipulation since no heat is diffused and the system is unchangeable, but the Web structure is completely ignored since eγR f(0) = e0R f(0) = If(0) = f(0); when γ = ∞, DiffusionRank becomes PageRank, it can be manipulated easily.",
        "We expect an appropriate setting of γ that can balance both.",
        "For this, we have no theoretical result, but in practice we find that γ = 1 works well in Section 5.",
        "Next we discuss how to determine the number of iterations if we employ the discrete heat kernel. 4.4 The Number of Iterations While we enjoy the advantage of the concise form of the exponential heat kernel, it is better for us to calculate DiffusionRank by employing Eq. (6) in an iterative way.",
        "Then the problem about determining N-the number of iterations arises: For a given threshold , find N such that ||((I + γ N R)N − eγR )f(0)|| < for any f(0) whose sum is one.",
        "Since it is difficult to solve this problem, we propose a heuristic motivated by the following observations.",
        "When R = −I+P, by Eq. (7), we have (I+ γ N R)N = (I+ γ N (−I+ P))N = S−1      1 ∗ ∗ ∗ 0 (1 + γ(λ2−1) N )N ∗ ∗ 0 0 ... ∗ 0 0 0 (1 + γ(λn−1) N )N      S. (9) Comparing Eq. (8) and Eq. (9), we observe that the eigenvalues of (I + γ N R)N − eγR are (1 + γ(λn−1) N )N − eγ(λn−1) .",
        "We propose a heuristic method to determine N so that the difference between the eigenvalues are less than a threshold for only positive λs.",
        "We also observe that if γ = 1, λ < 1, then |(1+ γ(λ−1) N )N − eγ(λ−1) | < 0.005 if N ≥ 100, and |(1+ γ(λ−1) N )N −eγ(λ−1) | < 0.01 if N ≥ 30.",
        "So we can set N = 30, or N = 100, or others according to different accuracy requirements.",
        "In this paper, we use the relatively accurate setting N = 100 to make the real eigenvalues in (I + γ N R)N − eγR less than 0.005. 5.",
        "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we show the experimental data, the methodology, the setting, and the results. 5.1 Data Preparation Our input data consist of a toy graph, a middle-size realworld graph, and a large-size real-world graph.",

        "Note that, in Fig. 4 (a), we choose four trusted sets (L = 1), on which we test DiffusionRank and TrustRank, the results are denoted by DiffusionRanki and TrustRanki (i = 0, 1, 2, 3 denotes the four trusted set); in Fig. 4 (b), we choose one trusted set (L = 1).",
        "Moreover, in both Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. 4 (b), we show the results for DiffusionRank when we have no trusted set, and we trust all the pages before some of them are manipulated.",
        "We also test the order difference between the ranking order A before the page is manipulated and the ranking order PA after the page is manipulated.",
        "Because after manipulation, the number of pages changes, we only compare the common part of A and PA.",
        "This experiment is used to test the stability of all these algorithms.",
        "The less the order difference, the stabler the algorithm, in the sense that only a smaller part of the order relations is affected by the manipulation.",
        "Figure 5 (a) shows that the order difference values change when we add new nodes that point to the manipulated node.",
        "We give several γ settings.",
        "We find that when γ = 1, the least order difference is achieved by DiffusionRank.",
        "It is interesting to point out that as γ increases, the order difference will increase first; after reaching a maximum value, it will decrease, and finally it tends to the PageRank results.",
        "We show this tendency in Fig. 5 (b), in which we choose three different settings-the number of manipulated nodes are 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 respectively.",
        "From these figures, we can see that when γ < 2, the values are less than those for PageRank, and that when γ > 20, the difference between PageRank and DiffusionRank is very small.",
        "After these investigations, we find that in all the graphs we tested, DiffusionRank (when γ = 1) is most robust to manipulation both in value difference and order difference.",
        "The trust set selection algorithm proposed in [7] is effective for both TrustRank and DiffusionRank. 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 5 Number of New Added Points PairwiseOrderDifference PageRank DiffusionRank−Gamma=1 DiffusionRank−Gamma=2 DiffusionRank−Gamma=3 DiffusionRank−Gamma=4 DiffusionRank−Gamma=5 DiffusionRank−Gamma=15 TrustRank 0 5 10 15 20 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 5 Gamma PairwiseOrderDifference DiffusionRank: when added 2000 nodes DiffusionRank: when added 5000 nodes DiffusionRank: when added 10000 nodes PageRank (a) (b) Figure 5: (a) Pairwise order difference on the middle-size graph, the least it is, the more stable the algorithm; (b) The tendency of varying γ 6.",
        "CONCLUSIONS We conclude that DiffusionRank is a generalization of PageRank, which is interesting in that the heat diffusion coefficient γ can balance the extent that we want to model the original Web graph and the extent that we want to reduce the effect of link manipulations.",
        "The experimental results show that we can actually achieve such a balance by setting γ = 1, although the best setting including varying γi is still under further investigation.",
        "This anti-manipulation feature enables DiffusionRank to be a candidate as a penicillin for Web spamming.",
        "Moreover, DiffusionRank can be employed to find group-group relations and to partition Web graph into small communities.",
        "All these advantages can be achieved in the same computational complexity as PageRank.",
        "For the special application of anti-manipulation, DiffusionRank performs best both in reduction effects and in its stability among all the three algorithms. 7.",

                "To handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the Web structure, we propose a ranking algorithm called DiffusionRank.",
                "DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph.",
                "Theoretically we show that DiffusionRank can serve as a generalization of PageRank when the heat diffusion coefficient γ tends to infinity.",

                "The manipulation problem is also called the Web spam, which refers to hyperlinked pages on the World Wide Web that are created with the intention of misleading search engines [7].",
                "It is reported that approximately 70% of all pages in the .biz domain and about 35% of the pages in the .us domain belong to the spam category [12].",
                "The reason for the increasing amount of Web spam is explained in [12]: some web site operators try to influence the positioning of their pages within search results because of the large fraction of web traffic originating from searches and the high potential monetary value of this traffic.",
                "From the viewpoint of the Web site operators who want to increase the ranking value of a particular page for search engines, Keyword Stuffing and Link Stuffing are being used widely [7, 12].",
                "From the viewpoint of the search engine managers, the Web spam is very harmful to the users evaluations and thus their preference to choosing search engines because people believe that a good search engine should not return irrelevant or low-quality results.",

                "All the mentioned ranking algorithms are established on a graph.",
                "For our convenience, we first give some notations.",
                "Denote a static graph by G = (V, E), where V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}, E = {(vi, vj) | there is an edge from vi to vj}.",
                "Ii and di denote the in-degree and the out-degree of page i respectively. 2.1 PageRank The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes [13].",
                "However, the average importance of all readers can be considered as an objective matter.",
                "PageRank tries to find such average importance based on the Web link structure, which is considered to contain a large amount of statistical data.",
                "The Web is modelled by a directed graph G in the PageRank algorithms, and the rank or importance xi for page vi ∈ V is defined recursively in terms of pages which point to it: xi = (j,i)∈E aijxj, where aij is assumed to be 1/dj if there is a link from j to i, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Or in matrix terms, x = Ax.",
                "When the concept of random jump is introduced, the matrix form is changed to x = [(1 − α)g1T + αA]x, (1) where α is the probability of following the actual link from a page, (1 − α) is the probability of taking a random jump, and g is a stochastic vector, i.e., 1T g = 1.",
                "Typically, α = 0.85, and g = 1 n 1 is one of the standard settings, where 1 is the vector of all ones [6, 13]. 2.2 TrustRank TrustRank [7] is composed of two parts.",
                "The first part is the seed selection algorithm, in which the inverse PageRank was proposed to help an expert of determining a good node.",
                "The second part is to utilize the biased PageRank, in which the stochastic distribution g is set to be shared by all the trusted pages found in the first part.",
                "Moreover, the initial input of x is also set to be g. The justification for the inverse PageRank and the solid experiments support its advantage in combating the Web spam.",
                "Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank. 2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.",
                "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
                "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing.",
                "While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.",
                "In a medium, heat always flow from position with high temperature to position with low temperature.",
                "Heat kernel is used to describe the amount of heat that one point receives from another point.",
                "Recently, the idea of heat kernel on a manifold is borrowed in applications such as dimension reduction [3] and classification [9, 10, 14].",
                "In these work, the input data is considered to lie in a special structure.",
                "All the above topics are related to our work.",
                "The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3.",
                "HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values.",
                "In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold.",
                "The heat kernel established on the Web graph is considered as the representation of the relationship between Web pages.",
                "The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages.",
                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
                "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",
                "We view all the Web pages as points drawn from a highly complex geometric structure, like a manifold in a high dimensional space.",
                "On a manifold, heat can flow from one point to another through the underlying geometric structure in a given time period.",
                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a <br>random graph</br> as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a <br>random graph</br>. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
                "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",
                "The value fi(t) describes the heat at node vi at time t, beginning from an initial distribution of heat given by fi(0) at time zero. f(t) (f(0)) denotes the vector consisting of fi(t) (fi(0)).",
                "We construct our model as follows.",
                "Suppose, at time t, each node i receives M(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from its neighbor j during a period of ∆t.",
                "The heat M(i, j, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t and the heat difference fj(t) − fi(t).",

                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",

                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",

(1) we also need a multiplication operation between a matrix and a vector for each iteration. 4.3 The Physical Meaning of γ γ plays an important role in the anti-manipulation effect of DiffusionRank. γ is the thermal conductivity-the heat diffusion coefficient.",

                "To handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the Web structure, we propose a <br>ranking</br> algorithm called DiffusionRank.",
                "DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web <br>ranking</br> because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph.",
                "Theoretically we show that DiffusionRank can serve as a generalization of PageRank when the heat diffusion coefficient γ tends to infinity.",

                "It is reported that approximately 70% of all pages in the .biz domain and about 35% of the pages in the .us domain belong to the spam category [12].",
                "The reason for the increasing amount of Web spam is explained in [12]: some web site operators try to influence the positioning of their pages within search results because of the large fraction of web traffic originating from searches and the high potential monetary value of this traffic.",
                "From the viewpoint of the Web site operators who want to increase the <br>ranking</br> value of a particular page for search engines, Keyword Stuffing and Link Stuffing are being used widely [7, 12].",
                "From the viewpoint of the search engine managers, the Web spam is very harmful to the users evaluations and thus their preference to choosing search engines because people believe that a good search engine should not return irrelevant or low-quality results.",

                "Machine learning methods are employed to handle the keyword stuffing.",
                "To successfully apply machine learning methods, we need to dig out some useful textual features for Web pages, to mark part of the Web pages as either spam or non-spam, then to apply supervised learning techniques to mark other pages.",

                "For our convenience, we first give some notations.",
                "Denote a static graph by G = (V, E), where V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}, E = {(vi, vj) | there is an edge from vi to vj}.",
                "Ii and di denote the in-degree and the out-degree of page i respectively. 2.1 PageRank The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes [13].",
                "However, the average importance of all readers can be considered as an objective matter.",
                "PageRank tries to find such average importance based on the Web link structure, which is considered to contain a large amount of statistical data.",
                "The Web is modelled by a directed graph G in the PageRank algorithms, and the rank or importance xi for page vi ∈ V is defined recursively in terms of pages which point to it: xi = (j,i)∈E aijxj, where aij is assumed to be 1/dj if there is a link from j to i, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Or in matrix terms, x = Ax.",
                "When the concept of random jump is introduced, the matrix form is changed to x = [(1 − α)g1T + αA]x, (1) where α is the probability of following the actual link from a page, (1 − α) is the probability of taking a random jump, and g is a stochastic vector, i.e., 1T g = 1.",
                "Typically, α = 0.85, and g = 1 n 1 is one of the standard settings, where 1 is the vector of all ones [6, 13]. 2.2 TrustRank TrustRank [7] is composed of two parts.",
                "The first part is the seed selection algorithm, in which the inverse PageRank was proposed to help an expert of determining a good node.",
                "The second part is to utilize the biased PageRank, in which the stochastic distribution g is set to be shared by all the trusted pages found in the first part.",
                "Moreover, the initial input of x is also set to be g. The justification for the inverse PageRank and the solid experiments support its advantage in combating the Web spam.",
                "Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based <br>ranking</br> algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank. 2.3 Manifold <br>ranking</br> In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.",
                "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
                "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing.",
                "While the manifold <br>ranking</br> algorithm achieves an impressive result on <br>ranking</br> images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.",
                "In a medium, heat always flow from position with high temperature to position with low temperature.",
                "Heat kernel is used to describe the amount of heat that one point receives from another point.",
                "Recently, the idea of heat kernel on a manifold is borrowed in applications such as dimension reduction [3] and classification [9, 10, 14].",

                "All the above topics are related to our work.",
                "The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of <br>ranking</br> on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3.",
                "HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate <br>ranking</br> values.",
                "In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold.",

                "The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages.",
                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a <br>ranking</br> algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
                "This <br>ranking</br> algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",
                "We view all the Web pages as points drawn from a highly complex geometric structure, like a manifold in a high dimensional space.",
                "On a manifold, heat can flow from one point to another through the underlying geometric structure in a given time period.",
                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
                "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",
                "The value fi(t) describes the heat at node vi at time t, beginning from an initial distribution of heat given by fi(0) at time zero. f(t) (f(0)) denotes the vector consisting of fi(t) (fi(0)).",
                "We construct our model as follows.",
                "Suppose, at time t, each node i receives M(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from its neighbor j during a period of ∆t.",
                "The heat M(i, j, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t and the heat difference fj(t) − fi(t).",
                "Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j.",
                "Based on this consideration, we assume that M(i, j, t, ∆t) = γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t.",
                "As a result, the heat difference at node i between time t + ∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives from all its neighbors.",
                "This is formulated as fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = j:(j,i)∈E γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t, (2) where E is the set of edges.",
                "To find a closed form solution to Eq. (2), we express it in a matrix form: (f(t + ∆t) − f(t))/∆t = γHf(t), where d(v) denotes the degree of the node v. In the limit ∆t → 0, it becomes d dt f(t) = γHf(t).",
                "Solving it, we obtain f(t) = eγtH f(0), especially we have f(1) = eγH f(0), Hij =    −d(vj), j = i, 1, (vj, vi) ∈ E, 0, otherwise, (3) where eγH is defined as eγH = I+γH+ γ2 2!",

                "H3 +· · · . 3.4 On a Directed Graph The above heat diffusion model must be modified to fit the situation where the links between Web pages are directed.",
                "On one Web page, when the page-maker creates a link (a, b) to another page b, he actually forces the energy flow, for example, peoples click-through activities, to that page, and so there is added energy imposed on the link.",
                "As a result, heat flows in a one-way manner, only from a to b, not from b to a.",
                "Based on such consideration, we modified the heat diffusion model on an undirected graph as follows.",
                "On a directed graph G, the pipe (vi, vj) is forced by added energy such that heat flows only from vi to vj.",
                "Suppose, at time t, each node vi receives RH = RH(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from vj during a period of ∆t.",
                "We have three assumptions: (1) RH should be proportional to the time period ∆t; (2) RH should be proportional to the the heat at node vj; and (3) RH is zero if there is no link from vj to vi.",
                "As a result, vi will receive j:(vj ,vi)∈E σjfj(t)∆t amount of heat from all its neighbors that points to it.",
                "On the other hand, node vi diffuses DH(i, t, ∆t) amount of heat to its subsequent nodes.",
                "We assume that: (1) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t. (2) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the the heat at node vi. (3) Each node has the same ability of diffusing heat.",
                "This fits the intuition that a Web surfer only has one choice to find the next page that he wants to browse. (4) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be uniformly distributed to its subsequent nodes.",
                "The real situation is more complex than what we assume, but we have to make this simple assumption in order to make our model concise.",
                "As a result, node vi will diffuse γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat to any of its subsequent nodes, and each of its subsequent node should receive γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat.",

                "This can be seen in two viewpoints.",
                "The first one is that in Eq. (1), the Web graph is actually modelled as a random graph, there is an edge from node vi to node vj with a probability of (1 − α)gj (see the item (1 − α)g1T ), and that the Web graph is predicted by a random graph [15, 16].",
                "The second one is that the Web structure is a random graph in essence if we consider the content similarity between two pages, though this is not done in this paper.",
                "For these reasons, the model would become more flexible if we extend it to random graphs.",
                "The definition of a random graph is given below.",
                "Definition 1.",

                "The original definition of random graphs in [4], is changed slightly to consider the situation of directed graphs.",
                "Note that every static graph can be considered as a special random graph in the sense that pij can only be 0 or 1.",
                "On a random graph RG = (V, P), where P = (pij) is the probability of the edge (vi, vj) exists.",

(4) in the case of a static graph or Eq. (6) in the case of a random graph, in which f(0) is set to be a special initial heat distribution so that the trusted Web pages have unit heat while all the others have zero heat.",

(1) we also need a multiplication operation between a matrix and a vector for each iteration. 4.3 The Physical Meaning of γ γ plays an important role in the anti-manipulation effect of DiffusionRank. γ is the thermal conductivity-the heat diffusion coefficient.",

                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",

                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",

                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",

                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",

                "Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j.",
                "Based on this consideration, we assume that M(i, j, t, ∆t) = γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t.",

                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
                "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",
                "We view all the Web pages as points drawn from a highly complex geometric structure, like a manifold in a high dimensional space.",

                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
                "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",
                "The value fi(t) describes the heat at node vi at time t, beginning from an initial distribution of heat given by fi(0) at time zero. f(t) (f(0)) denotes the vector consisting of fi(t) (fi(0)).",
                "We construct our model as follows.",
                "Suppose, at time t, each node i receives M(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from its neighbor j during a period of ∆t.",
                "The heat M(i, j, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t and the heat difference fj(t) − fi(t).",
                "Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j.",
                "Based on this consideration, we assume that M(i, j, t, ∆t) = γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t.",
                "As a result, the heat difference at node i between time t + ∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives from all its neighbors.",
                "This is formulated as fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = j:(j,i)∈E γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t, (2) where E is the set of edges.",
                "To find a closed form solution to Eq. (2), we express it in a matrix form: (f(t + ∆t) − f(t))/∆t = γHf(t), where d(v) denotes the degree of the node v. In the limit ∆t → 0, it becomes d dt f(t) = γHf(t).",
                "Solving it, we obtain f(t) = eγtH f(0), especially we have f(1) = eγH f(0), Hij =    −d(vj), j = i, 1, (vj, vi) ∈ E, 0, otherwise, (3) where eγH is defined as eγH = I+γH+ γ2 2!",

                "On one Web page, when the page-maker creates a link (a, b) to another page b, he actually forces the energy flow, for example, peoples click-through activities, to that page, and so there is added energy imposed on the link.",

                "For example, let G2 and G1 denote two groups, containing pages (j1, j2, . . . , js) and (i1, i2, . . . , it), respectively.",
                "Then u,v hiu,jv is the total amounts of heat that G1 receives from G2, where hiu,jv is the iu−th row jv−th column element of the heat kernel.",
                "More specifically, we need to first set f(0) for such an application as follows.",
                "In f(0) = (f1(0), f2(0), . . . , fn(0))T , if i ∈ {j1, j2, . . . , js}, then fi(0) = 1, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Then we employ Eq. (5) to calculate f(1) = (f1(1), f2(1), . . . , fn(1))T , finally we sum those fj(1) where j ∈ {i1, i2, . . . , it}.",
                "Fig. 1 (a) shows the results generated by the DiffusionRank.",
                "We consider five groups-five departments in our Engineering Faculty: CSE, MAE, EE, IE, and SE. γ is set to be 1, the numbers in Fig. 1 (a) are the amount of heat that they diffuse to each other.",
                "These results are normalized by the total number of each group, and the edges are ignored if the values are less than 0.000001.",
                "The group-to-group relations are therefore detected, for example, we can see that the most strong overall tie is from EE to IE.",
                "While it is a natural application for DiffusionRank because of the easy interpretation by the amount heat from one group to another group, it is difficult to apply other ranking techniques to such an application because they lack such a physical meaning. 4.2.3 Graph cut Third, it can be used to partition the Web graph into several parts.",
                "A quick example is shown below.",

(4) in the case of a static graph or Eq. (6) in the case of a random graph, in which f(0) is set to be a special initial heat distribution so that the trusted Web pages have unit heat while all the others have zero heat.",
                "In doing so, manipulated Web page will get a lower rank unless it has strong in-links from the trusted Web pages directly or indirectly.",

(1) we also need a multiplication operation between a matrix and a vector for each iteration. 4.3 The Physical Meaning of γ γ plays an important role in the anti-manipulation effect of DiffusionRank. γ is the thermal conductivity-the heat diffusion coefficient.",

                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",

                "of Computer Science and Engineering The Chinese University of Hong Kong Shatin, NT, Hong Kong {hxyang,king,lyu}@cse.cuhk.edu.hk ABSTRACT While the PageRank algorithm has proven to be very effective for ranking Web pages, the rank scores of Web pages can be manipulated.",
                "To handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the Web structure, we propose a ranking algorithm called DiffusionRank.",
                "DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph.",
                "Theoretically we show that DiffusionRank can serve as a generalization of PageRank when the heat diffusion coefficient γ tends to infinity.",
                "In such a case 1/γ = 0, DiffusionRank (PageRank) has low ability of anti-manipulation.",
                "When γ = 0, DiffusionRank obtains the highest ability of anti-manipulation, but in such a case, the web structure is completely ignored.",
                "Consequently, γ is an interesting factor that can control the balance between the ability of preserving the original Web and the ability of reducing the effect of manipulation.",
                "It is found empirically that, when γ = 1, DiffusionRank has a Penicillin-like effect on the link manipulation.",
                "Moreover, DiffusionRank can be employed to find group-to-group relations on the Web, to divide the Web graph into several parts, and to find link communities.",
                "Experimental results show that the DiffusionRank algorithm achieves the above mentioned advantages as expected.",

                "INTRODUCTION While the PageRank algorithm [13] has proven to be very effective for ranking Web pages, inaccurate PageRank results are induced because of web page manipulations by people for commercial interests.",
                "The manipulation problem is also called the Web spam, which refers to hyperlinked pages on the World Wide Web that are created with the intention of misleading search engines [7].",
                "It is reported that approximately 70% of all pages in the .biz domain and about 35% of the pages in the .us domain belong to the spam category [12].",
                "The reason for the increasing amount of Web spam is explained in [12]: some web site operators try to influence the positioning of their pages within search results because of the large fraction of web traffic originating from searches and the high potential monetary value of this traffic.",
                "From the viewpoint of the Web site operators who want to increase the ranking value of a particular page for search engines, <br>keyword stuffing</br> and Link Stuffing are being used widely [7, 12].",
                "From the viewpoint of the search engine managers, the Web spam is very harmful to the users evaluations and thus their preference to choosing search engines because people believe that a good search engine should not return irrelevant or low-quality results.",

                "Machine learning methods are employed to handle the <br>keyword stuffing</br>.",
                "To successfully apply machine learning methods, we need to dig out some useful textual features for Web pages, to mark part of the Web pages as either spam or non-spam, then to apply supervised learning techniques to mark other pages.",

                "All the mentioned ranking algorithms are established on a graph.",
                "For our convenience, we first give some notations.",
                "Denote a static graph by G = (V, E), where V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}, E = {(vi, vj) | there is an edge from vi to vj}.",
                "Ii and di denote the in-degree and the out-degree of page i respectively. 2.1 PageRank The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes [13].",
                "However, the average importance of all readers can be considered as an objective matter.",
                "PageRank tries to find such average importance based on the Web link structure, which is considered to contain a large amount of statistical data.",
                "The Web is modelled by a directed graph G in the PageRank algorithms, and the rank or importance xi for page vi ∈ V is defined recursively in terms of pages which point to it: xi = (j,i)∈E aijxj, where aij is assumed to be 1/dj if there is a link from j to i, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Or in matrix terms, x = Ax.",
                "When the concept of random jump is introduced, the matrix form is changed to x = [(1 − α)g1T + αA]x, (1) where α is the probability of following the actual link from a page, (1 − α) is the probability of taking a random jump, and g is a stochastic vector, i.e., 1T g = 1.",
                "Typically, α = 0.85, and g = 1 n 1 is one of the standard settings, where 1 is the vector of all ones [6, 13]. 2.2 TrustRank TrustRank [7] is composed of two parts.",
                "The first part is the seed selection algorithm, in which the inverse PageRank was proposed to help an expert of determining a good node.",
                "The second part is to utilize the biased PageRank, in which the stochastic distribution g is set to be shared by all the trusted pages found in the first part.",
                "Moreover, the initial input of x is also set to be g. The justification for the inverse PageRank and the solid experiments support its advantage in combating the Web spam.",
                "Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank. 2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.",
                "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
                "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing.",
                "While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.",
                "In a medium, heat always flow from position with high temperature to position with low temperature.",
                "Heat kernel is used to describe the amount of heat that one point receives from another point.",
                "Recently, the idea of heat kernel on a manifold is borrowed in applications such as dimension reduction [3] and classification [9, 10, 14].",
                "In these work, the input data is considered to lie in a special structure.",
                "All the above topics are related to our work.",
                "The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3.",
                "HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values.",
                "In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold.",
                "The heat kernel established on the Web graph is considered as the representation of the relationship between Web pages.",
                "The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages.",
                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
                "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",
                "We view all the Web pages as points drawn from a highly complex geometric structure, like a manifold in a high dimensional space.",
                "On a manifold, heat can flow from one point to another through the underlying geometric structure in a given time period.",
                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
                "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",
                "The value fi(t) describes the heat at node vi at time t, beginning from an initial distribution of heat given by fi(0) at time zero. f(t) (f(0)) denotes the vector consisting of fi(t) (fi(0)).",
                "We construct our model as follows.",
                "Suppose, at time t, each node i receives M(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from its neighbor j during a period of ∆t.",
                "The heat M(i, j, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t and the heat difference fj(t) − fi(t).",
                "Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j.",
                "Based on this consideration, we assume that M(i, j, t, ∆t) = γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t.",
                "As a result, the heat difference at node i between time t + ∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives from all its neighbors.",
                "This is formulated as fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = j:(j,i)∈E γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t, (2) where E is the set of edges.",
                "To find a closed form solution to Eq. (2), we express it in a matrix form: (f(t + ∆t) − f(t))/∆t = γHf(t), where d(v) denotes the degree of the node v. In the limit ∆t → 0, it becomes d dt f(t) = γHf(t).",
                "Solving it, we obtain f(t) = eγtH f(0), especially we have f(1) = eγH f(0), Hij =    −d(vj), j = i, 1, (vj, vi) ∈ E, 0, otherwise, (3) where eγH is defined as eγH = I+γH+ γ2 2!",

                "H3 +· · · . 3.4 On a Directed Graph The above heat diffusion model must be modified to fit the situation where the links between Web pages are directed.",
                "On one Web page, when the page-maker creates a link (a, b) to another page b, he actually forces the energy flow, for example, peoples click-through activities, to that page, and so there is added energy imposed on the link.",
                "As a result, heat flows in a one-way manner, only from a to b, not from b to a.",
                "Based on such consideration, we modified the heat diffusion model on an undirected graph as follows.",
                "On a directed graph G, the pipe (vi, vj) is forced by added energy such that heat flows only from vi to vj.",
                "Suppose, at time t, each node vi receives RH = RH(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from vj during a period of ∆t.",
                "We have three assumptions: (1) RH should be proportional to the time period ∆t; (2) RH should be proportional to the the heat at node vj; and (3) RH is zero if there is no link from vj to vi.",
                "As a result, vi will receive j:(vj ,vi)∈E σjfj(t)∆t amount of heat from all its neighbors that points to it.",
                "On the other hand, node vi diffuses DH(i, t, ∆t) amount of heat to its subsequent nodes.",
                "We assume that: (1) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t. (2) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the the heat at node vi. (3) Each node has the same ability of diffusing heat.",
                "This fits the intuition that a Web surfer only has one choice to find the next page that he wants to browse. (4) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be uniformly distributed to its subsequent nodes.",
                "The real situation is more complex than what we assume, but we have to make this simple assumption in order to make our model concise.",
                "As a result, node vi will diffuse γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat to any of its subsequent nodes, and each of its subsequent node should receive γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat.",
                "Therefore σj = γ/dj.",

                "This can be seen in two viewpoints.",
                "The first one is that in Eq. (1), the Web graph is actually modelled as a random graph, there is an edge from node vi to node vj with a probability of (1 − α)gj (see the item (1 − α)g1T ), and that the Web graph is predicted by a random graph [15, 16].",
                "The second one is that the Web structure is a random graph in essence if we consider the content similarity between two pages, though this is not done in this paper.",
                "For these reasons, the model would become more flexible if we extend it to random graphs.",
                "The definition of a random graph is given below.",
                "Definition 1.",
                "A random graph RG = (V, P = (pij)) is defined as a graph with a vertex set V in which the edges are chosen independently, and for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ |V | the probability of (vi, vj) being an edge is exactly pij.",
                "The original definition of random graphs in [4], is changed slightly to consider the situation of directed graphs.",
                "Note that every static graph can be considered as a special random graph in the sense that pij can only be 0 or 1.",
                "On a random graph RG = (V, P), where P = (pij) is the probability of the edge (vi, vj) exists.",

                "Since the probability of the link (vj, vi) is pji, the expected heat flow from node j to node i should be multiplied by pji, and so we have fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = −γ fi(t) ∆t + j:(vj ,vi)∈E γpjifj(t)∆t/RD+ (vj), where RD+ (vi) is the expected out-degree of node vi, it is defined as k pik.",
                "Similarly we have f(1) = eγR f(0), Rij =    −1, j = i; pji/RD+ (vj), j = i. (5) When the graph is large, a direct computation of eγR is time-consuming, and we adopt its discrete approximation: f(1) = (I + γ N R)N f(0). (6) The matrix (I+ γ N R)N in Eq. (6) and matrix eγR in Eq. (5) are called Discrete Diffusion Kernel and the Continuous Diffusion Kernel respectively.",

                "The heat distribution is exactly the i−th row of the matrix of (I + γ N R)N or eγR .",
                "So the ith-row jth-column element hij in the matrix (I + γ∆tR)N or eγR means the amount of heat that vi can receive from vj from time 0 to 1.",
                "Thus the value hij can be used to measure the similarity from vj to vi.",
                "For a static graph, similarly the matrix (I + γ N H)N or eγH can measure the similarity relationship between nodes.",
                "The intuition behind is that the amount h(i, j) of heat that a page vi receives from a unit heat in a page vj in a unit time embodies the extent of the link connections from page vj to page vi.",

                "For example, let G2 and G1 denote two groups, containing pages (j1, j2, . . . , js) and (i1, i2, . . . , it), respectively.",
                "Then u,v hiu,jv is the total amounts of heat that G1 receives from G2, where hiu,jv is the iu−th row jv−th column element of the heat kernel.",
                "More specifically, we need to first set f(0) for such an application as follows.",
                "In f(0) = (f1(0), f2(0), . . . , fn(0))T , if i ∈ {j1, j2, . . . , js}, then fi(0) = 1, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Then we employ Eq. (5) to calculate f(1) = (f1(1), f2(1), . . . , fn(1))T , finally we sum those fj(1) where j ∈ {i1, i2, . . . , it}.",
                "Fig. 1 (a) shows the results generated by the DiffusionRank.",
                "We consider five groups-five departments in our Engineering Faculty: CSE, MAE, EE, IE, and SE. γ is set to be 1, the numbers in Fig. 1 (a) are the amount of heat that they diffuse to each other.",
                "These results are normalized by the total number of each group, and the edges are ignored if the values are less than 0.000001.",
                "The group-to-group relations are therefore detected, for example, we can see that the most strong overall tie is from EE to IE.",
                "While it is a natural application for DiffusionRank because of the easy interpretation by the amount heat from one group to another group, it is difficult to apply other ranking techniques to such an application because they lack such a physical meaning. 4.2.3 Graph cut Third, it can be used to partition the Web graph into several parts.",
                "A quick example is shown below.",

                "Let G2 contain trusted Web pages (j1, j2, . . . , js), then for each page i, v hi,jv is the heat that page i receives from G2, and can be computed by the discrete approximation of Eq. (4) in the case of a static graph or Eq. (6) in the case of a random graph, in which f(0) is set to be a special initial heat distribution so that the trusted Web pages have unit heat while all the others have zero heat.",
                "In doing so, manipulated Web page will get a lower rank unless it has strong in-links from the trusted Web pages directly or indirectly.",
                "The situation is quite different for PageRank because PageRank is inputindependent as we have shown in Section 3.1.",
                "Based on the fact that the connection from a trusted page to a bad page should be weak-less uncross paths, longer distance and narrower pipe, we can say DiffusionRank can resist web spam if we can select trusted pages.",

                "For such an application of DiffusionRank, the computation complexity for Discrete Diffusion Kernel is the same as that for PageRank in cases of both a static graph and a random graph.",
                "This can be seen in Eq. (6), by which we need N iterations and for each iteration we need a multiplication operation between a matrix and a vector, while in Eq. (1) we also need a multiplication operation between a matrix and a vector for each iteration. 4.3 The Physical Meaning of γ γ plays an important role in the anti-manipulation effect of DiffusionRank. γ is the thermal conductivity-the heat diffusion coefficient.",
                "If it has a high value, heat will diffuse very quickly.",
                "Conversely, if it is small, heat will diffuse slowly.",
                "In the extreme case, if it is infinitely large, then heat will diffuse from one node to other nodes immediately, and this is exactly the case corresponding to PageRank.",

                "When γ = 0, the ranking value is most robust to manipulation since no heat is diffused and the system is unchangeable, but the Web structure is completely ignored since eγR f(0) = e0R f(0) = If(0) = f(0); when γ = ∞, DiffusionRank becomes PageRank, it can be manipulated easily.",
                "We expect an appropriate setting of γ that can balance both.",

(6) in an iterative way.",

                "The reason for the increasing amount of Web spam is explained in [12]: some web site operators try to influence the positioning of their pages within search results because of the large fraction of web traffic originating from searches and the high potential monetary value of this traffic.",

                "Or in matrix terms, x = Ax.",
                "When the concept of random jump is introduced, the matrix form is changed to x = [(1 − α)g1T + αA]x, (1) where α is the probability of following the actual link from a page, (1 − α) is the probability of taking a random jump, and g is a stochastic vector, i.e., 1T g = 1.",
                "Typically, α = 0.85, and g = 1 n 1 is one of the standard settings, where 1 is the vector of all ones [6, 13]. 2.2 TrustRank TrustRank [7] is composed of two parts.",

                "Moreover, the initial input of x is also set to be g. The justification for the inverse PageRank and the solid experiments support its advantage in combating the Web spam.",
                "Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank. 2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.",
                "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
                "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing.",
                "While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.",
                "In a medium, heat always flow from position with high temperature to position with low temperature.",
                "Heat kernel is used to describe the amount of heat that one point receives from another point.",

                "The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3.",
                "HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values.",
                "In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold.",
                "The heat kernel established on the Web graph is considered as the representation of the relationship between Web pages.",
                "The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages.",
                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
                "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",
                "We view all the Web pages as points drawn from a highly complex geometric structure, like a manifold in a high dimensional space.",
                "On a manifold, heat can flow from one point to another through the underlying geometric structure in a given time period.",
                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
                "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",

                "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
                "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing.",
                "While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.",
                "In a medium, heat always flow from position with high temperature to position with low temperature.",

                "All the above topics are related to our work.",
                "The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3.",
                "HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values.",
                "In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold.",
                "The heat kernel established on the Web graph is considered as the representation of the relationship between Web pages.",
                "The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages.",
                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
                "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",

                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
                "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",

                "Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j.",
                "Based on this consideration, we assume that M(i, j, t, ∆t) = γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t.",

                "To handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the Web structure, we propose a ranking algorithm called DiffusionRank.",
                "DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph.",

                "Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank. 2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.",
                "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
                "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing.",
                "While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.",

                "The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3.",
                "HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values.",
                "In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold.",

                "The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages.",
                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
                "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",
                "We view all the Web pages as points drawn from a highly complex geometric structure, like a manifold in a high dimensional space.",
                "On a manifold, heat can flow from one point to another through the underlying geometric structure in a given time period.",
                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
                "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",
                "The value fi(t) describes the heat at node vi at time t, beginning from an initial distribution of heat given by fi(0) at time zero. f(t) (f(0)) denotes the vector consisting of fi(t) (fi(0)).",
                "We construct our model as follows.",
                "Suppose, at time t, each node i receives M(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from its neighbor j during a period of ∆t.",
                "The heat M(i, j, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t and the heat difference fj(t) − fi(t).",
                "Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j.",
                "Based on this consideration, we assume that M(i, j, t, ∆t) = γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t.",
                "As a result, the heat difference at node i between time t + ∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives from all its neighbors.",
                "This is formulated as fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = j:(j,i)∈E γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t, (2) where E is the set of edges.",
                "To find a closed form solution to Eq. (2), we express it in a matrix form: (f(t + ∆t) − f(t))/∆t = γHf(t), where d(v) denotes the degree of the node v. In the limit ∆t → 0, it becomes d dt f(t) = γHf(t).",
                "Solving it, we obtain f(t) = eγtH f(0), especially we have f(1) = eγH f(0), Hij =    −d(vj), j = i, 1, (vj, vi) ∈ E, 0, otherwise, (3) where eγH is defined as eγH = I+γH+ γ2 2!",

                "On one Web page, when the page-maker creates a link (a, b) to another page b, he actually forces the energy flow, for example, peoples click-through activities, to that page, and so there is added energy imposed on the link.",
                "As a result, heat flows in a one-way manner, only from a to b, not from b to a.",
                "Based on such consideration, we modified the heat diffusion model on an undirected graph as follows.",
                "On a directed graph G, the pipe (vi, vj) is forced by added energy such that heat flows only from vi to vj.",
                "Suppose, at time t, each node vi receives RH = RH(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from vj during a period of ∆t.",
                "We have three assumptions: (1) RH should be proportional to the time period ∆t; (2) RH should be proportional to the the heat at node vj; and (3) RH is zero if there is no link from vj to vi.",
                "As a result, vi will receive j:(vj ,vi)∈E σjfj(t)∆t amount of heat from all its neighbors that points to it.",
                "On the other hand, node vi diffuses DH(i, t, ∆t) amount of heat to its subsequent nodes.",
                "We assume that: (1) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t. (2) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the the heat at node vi. (3) Each node has the same ability of diffusing heat.",
                "This fits the intuition that a Web surfer only has one choice to find the next page that he wants to browse. (4) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be uniformly distributed to its subsequent nodes.",
                "The real situation is more complex than what we assume, but we have to make this simple assumption in order to make our model concise.",
                "As a result, node vi will diffuse γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat to any of its subsequent nodes, and each of its subsequent node should receive γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat.",

                "This can be seen in two viewpoints.",
                "The first one is that in Eq. (1), the Web graph is actually modelled as a random graph, there is an edge from node vi to node vj with a probability of (1 − α)gj (see the item (1 − α)g1T ), and that the Web graph is predicted by a random graph [15, 16].",
                "The second one is that the Web structure is a random graph in essence if we consider the content similarity between two pages, though this is not done in this paper.",
                "For these reasons, the model would become more flexible if we extend it to random graphs.",
                "The definition of a random graph is given below.",
                "Definition 1.",
                "A random graph RG = (V, P = (pij)) is defined as a graph with a vertex set V in which the edges are chosen independently, and for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ |V | the probability of (vi, vj) being an edge is exactly pij.",
                "The original definition of random graphs in [4], is changed slightly to consider the situation of directed graphs.",
                "Note that every static graph can be considered as a special random graph in the sense that pij can only be 0 or 1.",
                "On a random graph RG = (V, P), where P = (pij) is the probability of the edge (vi, vj) exists.",

                "Since the probability of the link (vj, vi) is pji, the expected heat flow from node j to node i should be multiplied by pji, and so we have fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = −γ fi(t) ∆t + j:(vj ,vi)∈E γpjifj(t)∆t/RD+ (vj), where RD+ (vi) is the expected out-degree of node vi, it is defined as k pik.",
                "Similarly we have f(1) = eγR f(0), Rij =    −1, j = i; pji/RD+ (vj), j = i. (5) When the graph is large, a direct computation of eγR is time-consuming, and we adopt its discrete approximation: f(1) = (I + γ N R)N f(0). (6) The matrix (I+ γ N R)N in Eq. (6) and matrix eγR in Eq. (5) are called Discrete Diffusion Kernel and the Continuous Diffusion Kernel respectively.",

                "While it is a natural application for DiffusionRank because of the easy interpretation by the amount heat from one group to another group, it is difficult to apply other ranking techniques to such an application because they lack such a physical meaning. 4.2.3 Graph cut Third, it can be used to partition the Web graph into several parts.",

(4) in the case of a static graph or Eq. (6) in the case of a random graph, in which f(0) is set to be a special initial heat distribution so that the trusted Web pages have unit heat while all the others have zero heat.",

(1) we also need a multiplication operation between a matrix and a vector for each iteration. 4.3 The Physical Meaning of γ γ plays an important role in the anti-manipulation effect of DiffusionRank. γ is the thermal conductivity-the heat diffusion coefficient.",

                "Or in matrix terms, x = Ax.",
                "When the concept of random jump is introduced, the matrix form is changed to x = [(1 − α)g1T + αA]x, (1) where α is the probability of following the actual link from a page, (1 − α) is the probability of taking a random jump, and g is a stochastic vector, i.e., 1T g = 1.",
                "Typically, α = 0.85, and g = 1 n 1 is one of the standard settings, where 1 is the vector of all ones [6, 13]. 2.2 TrustRank TrustRank [7] is composed of two parts.",

                "Moreover, the initial input of x is also set to be g. The justification for the inverse PageRank and the solid experiments support its advantage in combating the Web spam.",
                "Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank. 2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.",
                "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
                "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing.",

                "HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values.",
                "In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold.",

                "The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages.",
                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
                "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",
                "We view all the Web pages as points drawn from a highly complex geometric structure, like a manifold in a high dimensional space.",
                "On a manifold, heat can flow from one point to another through the underlying geometric structure in a given time period.",
                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",

                "Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank. 2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.",
                "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
                "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the <br>gaussian kernel smoothing</br>.",
                "While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.",
                "In a medium, heat always flow from position with high temperature to position with low temperature.",

                "In these work, the input data is considered to lie in a special structure.",
                "All the above topics are related to our work.",
                "The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3.",
                "HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values.",
                "In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold.",
                "The heat kernel established on the Web graph is considered as the representation of the relationship between Web pages.",
                "The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages.",
                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
                "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",

                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
                "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",
                "The value fi(t) describes the heat at node vi at time t, beginning from an initial distribution of heat given by fi(0) at time zero. f(t) (f(0)) denotes the vector consisting of fi(t) (fi(0)).",

                "The heat M(i, j, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t and the heat difference fj(t) − fi(t).",
                "Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j.",
                "Based on this consideration, we assume that M(i, j, t, ∆t) = γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t.",
                "As a result, the heat difference at node i between time t + ∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives from all its neighbors.",

                "To handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the Web structure, we propose a ranking algorithm called DiffusionRank.",
                "DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph.",

                "The reason for the increasing amount of Web spam is explained in [12]: some web site operators try to influence the positioning of their pages within search results because of the large fraction of web traffic originating from searches and the high potential monetary value of this traffic.",

                "Moreover, the initial input of x is also set to be g. The justification for the inverse PageRank and the solid experiments support its advantage in combating the Web spam.",
                "Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank. 2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.",
                "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
                "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing.",
                "While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.",

                "The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3.",

                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the <br>equal voting ability</br> of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This <br>equal voting ability</br> of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
                "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",
                "We view all the Web pages as points drawn from a highly complex geometric structure, like a manifold in a high dimensional space.",
                "On a manifold, heat can flow from one point to another through the underlying geometric structure in a given time period.",
                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
                "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",
                "The value fi(t) describes the heat at node vi at time t, beginning from an initial distribution of heat given by fi(0) at time zero. f(t) (f(0)) denotes the vector consisting of fi(t) (fi(0)).",
                "We construct our model as follows.",
                "Suppose, at time t, each node i receives M(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from its neighbor j during a period of ∆t.",
                "The heat M(i, j, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t and the heat difference fj(t) − fi(t).",
                "Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j.",
                "Based on this consideration, we assume that M(i, j, t, ∆t) = γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t.",
                "As a result, the heat difference at node i between time t + ∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives from all its neighbors.",
                "This is formulated as fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = j:(j,i)∈E γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t, (2) where E is the set of edges.",
                "To find a closed form solution to Eq. (2), we express it in a matrix form: (f(t + ∆t) − f(t))/∆t = γHf(t), where d(v) denotes the degree of the node v. In the limit ∆t → 0, it becomes d dt f(t) = γHf(t).",
                "Solving it, we obtain f(t) = eγtH f(0), especially we have f(1) = eγH f(0), Hij =    −d(vj), j = i, 1, (vj, vi) ∈ E, 0, otherwise, (3) where eγH is defined as eγH = I+γH+ γ2 2!",

                "On one Web page, when the page-maker creates a link (a, b) to another page b, he actually forces the energy flow, for example, peoples click-through activities, to that page, and so there is added energy imposed on the link.",
                "As a result, heat flows in a one-way manner, only from a to b, not from b to a.",

                "We have three assumptions: (1) RH should be proportional to the time period ∆t; (2) RH should be proportional to the the heat at node vj; and (3) RH is zero if there is no link from vj to vi.",
                "As a result, vi will receive j:(vj ,vi)∈E σjfj(t)∆t amount of heat from all its neighbors that points to it.",
                "On the other hand, node vi diffuses DH(i, t, ∆t) amount of heat to its subsequent nodes.",
                "We assume that: (1) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t. (2) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the the heat at node vi. (3) Each node has the same ability of diffusing heat.",
                "This fits the intuition that a Web surfer only has one choice to find the next page that he wants to browse. (4) The heat DH(i, t, ∆t) should be uniformly distributed to its subsequent nodes.",
                "The real situation is more complex than what we assume, but we have to make this simple assumption in order to make our model concise.",
                "As a result, node vi will diffuse γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat to any of its subsequent nodes, and each of its subsequent node should receive γfi(t)∆t/di amount of heat.",

                "This can be seen in two viewpoints.",
                "The first one is that in Eq. (1), the Web graph is actually modelled as a random graph, there is an edge from node vi to node vj with a probability of (1 − α)gj (see the item (1 − α)g1T ), and that the Web graph is predicted by a random graph [15, 16].",
                "The second one is that the Web structure is a random graph in essence if we consider the content similarity between two pages, though this is not done in this paper.",
                "For these reasons, the model would become more flexible if we extend it to random graphs.",

(5) When the graph is large, a direct computation of eγR is time-consuming, and we adopt its discrete approximation: f(1) = (I + γ N R)N f(0). (6) The matrix (I+ γ N R)N in Eq. (6) and matrix eγR in Eq. (5) are called Discrete Diffusion Kernel and the Continuous Diffusion Kernel respectively.",

                "In f(0) = (f1(0), f2(0), . . . , fn(0))T , if i ∈ {j1, j2, . . . , js}, then fi(0) = 1, and 0 otherwise.",

                "We consider five groups-five departments in our Engineering Faculty: CSE, MAE, EE, IE, and SE. γ is set to be 1, the numbers in Fig. 1 (a) are the amount of heat that they diffuse to each other.",
                "These results are normalized by the total number of each group, and the edges are ignored if the values are less than 0.000001.",
                "The group-to-group relations are therefore detected, for example, we can see that the most strong overall tie is from EE to IE.",
                "While it is a natural application for DiffusionRank because of the easy interpretation by the amount heat from one group to another group, it is difficult to apply other ranking techniques to such an application because they lack such a physical meaning. 4.2.3 Graph cut Third, it can be used to partition the Web graph into several parts.",

(4) in the case of a static graph or Eq. (6) in the case of a random graph, in which f(0) is set to be a special initial heat distribution so that the trusted Web pages have unit heat while all the others have zero heat.",

(1) we also need a multiplication operation between a matrix and a vector for each iteration. 4.3 The Physical Meaning of γ γ plays an important role in the anti-manipulation effect of DiffusionRank. γ is the thermal conductivity-the heat diffusion coefficient.",

(6) in an iterative way.",

                "Or in matrix terms, x = Ax.",
                "When the concept of random jump is introduced, the matrix form is changed to x = [(1 − α)g1T + αA]x, (1) where α is the probability of following the actual link from a page, (1 − α) is the probability of taking a random jump, and g is a stochastic vector, i.e., 1T g = 1.",
                "Typically, α = 0.85, and g = 1 n 1 is one of the standard settings, where 1 is the vector of all ones [6, 13]. 2.2 TrustRank TrustRank [7] is composed of two parts.",

                "Moreover, the initial input of x is also set to be g. The justification for the inverse PageRank and the solid experiments support its advantage in combating the Web spam.",
                "Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank. 2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.",
                "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
                "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing.",
                "While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.",

                "The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3.",
                "HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values.",
                "In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold.",

                "The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages.",
                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel DiffusionRank.",
                "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",
                "We view all the Web pages as points drawn from a highly complex geometric structure, like a manifold in a high dimensional space.",
                "On a manifold, heat can flow from one point to another through the underlying geometric structure in a given time period.",
                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the DiffusionRank which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
                "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",

                "Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and <br>diffusionrank</br>. 2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.",
                "The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.",
                "From the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the Gaussian Kernel smoothing.",
                "While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons. 2.4 Heat Diffusion Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.",
                "In a medium, heat always flow from position with high temperature to position with low temperature.",
                "Heat kernel is used to describe the amount of heat that one point receives from another point.",
                "Recently, the idea of heat kernel on a manifold is borrowed in applications such as dimension reduction [3] and classification [9, 10, 14].",
                "In these work, the input data is considered to lie in a special structure.",
                "All the above topics are related to our work.",
                "The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 3.",
                "HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values.",
                "In this paper, the Web pages are considered to be drawn from an unknown manifold, and the link structure forms a directed graph, which is considered as an approximation to the unknown manifold.",
                "The heat kernel established on the Web graph is considered as the representation of the relationship between Web pages.",
                "The temperature distribution after a fixed time period, induced by a special initial temperature distribution, is considered as the rank scores on the Web pages.",
                "Before establishing the proposed models, we first show our motivations. 3.1 Motivations There are two points to explain that PageRank is susceptible to web spam. • Over-democratic.",
                "There is a belief behind PageRank-all pages are born equal.",
                "This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.",
                "This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right. • Input-independent.",
                "For any given non-zero initial input, the iteration will converge to the same stable distribution corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix.",
                "This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.",
                "The input-independent feature of PageRank can be further explained as follows.",
                "P = [(1 − α)g1T + αA] is a positive stochastic matrix if g is set to be a positive stochastic vector (the uniform distribution is one of such settings), and so the largest eigenvalue is 1 and no other eigenvalue whose absolute value is equal to 1, which is guaranteed by the Perron Theorem [11].",
                "Let y be the eigenvector corresponding to 1, then we have Py = y.",
                "Let {xk} be the sequence generated from the iterations xk+1 = Pxk, and x0 is the initial input.",
                "If {xk} converges to x, then xk+1 = Pxk implies that x must satisfy Px = x.",
                "Since the only maximum eigenvalue is 1, we have x = cy where c is a constant, and if both x and y are normalized by their sums, then c = 1.",
                "The above discussions show that PageRank is independent of the initial input x0.",
                "In our opinion, g and α are objective parameters determined by the users behaviors and preferences.",
                "A, α and g are the true web structure.",
                "While A is obtained by a crawler and the setting α = 0.85 is accepted by the people, we think that g should be determined by a user behavior investigation, something like [1].",
                "Without any prior knowledge, g has to be set as g = 1 n 1.",
                "TrustRank model does not follow the true web structure by setting a biased g, but the effects of combatting spamming are achieved in [7]; PageRank is on the contrary in some ways.",
                "We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.",
                "We observe that the heat diffusion model is a natural way to avoid the over-democratic and input-independent feature of PageRank.",
                "Since heat always flows from a position with higher temperatures to one with lower temperatures, points are not equal as some points are born with high temperatures while others are born with low temperatures.",
                "On the other hand, different initial temperature distributions will give rise to different temperature distributions after a fixed time period.",
                "Based on these considerations, we propose the novel <br>diffusionrank</br>.",
                "This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.",

                "On a manifold, heat can flow from one point to another through the underlying geometric structure in a given time period.",
                "Different geometric structures determine different heat diffusion behaviors, and conversely the diffusion behavior can reflect the geometric structure.",
                "More specifically, on the manifold, the heat flows from one point to another point, and in a given time period, if one point x receives a large amount of heat from another point y, we can say x and y are well connected, and thus x and y have a high similarity in the sense of a high mutual connection.",
                "We note that on a point with unit mass, the temperature and the heat of this point are equivalent, and these two terms are interchangeable in this paper.",
                "In the following, we first show the HDM on a manifold, which is the origin of HDM, but cannot be employed to the World Wide Web directly, and so is considered as the ideal case.",
                "To connect the ideal case and the practical case, we then establish HDM on a graph as an intermediate case.",
                "To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.",
                "Finally we demonstrate the <br>diffusionrank</br> which is derived from the HDM on a random graph. 3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known, the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation: ∂f(x,t) ∂t − ∆f(x, t) = 0, where f(x, t) is the heat at location x at time t, and ∆f is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function f. The heat diffusion kernel Kt(x, y) is a special solution to the heat equation with a special initial condition-a unit heat source at position y when there is no heat in other positions.",
                "Based on this, the heat kernel Kt(x, y) describes the heat distribution at time t diffusing from the initial unit heat source at position y, and thus describes the connectivity (which is considered as a kind of similarity) between x and y.",
                "However, it is very difficult to represent the World Wide Web as a regular geometry with a known dimension; even the underlying is known, it is very difficult to find the heat kernel Kt(x, y), which involves solving the heat equation with the delta function as the initial condition.",
                "This motivates us to investigate the heat flow on a graph.",
                "The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold, and so the heat flow on the graph is considered as an approximation to the heat flow on the manifold. 3.3 On an Undirected Graph On an undirected graph G, the edge (vi, vj) is considered as a pipe that connects nodes vi and vj.",
                "The value fi(t) describes the heat at node vi at time t, beginning from an initial distribution of heat given by fi(0) at time zero. f(t) (f(0)) denotes the vector consisting of fi(t) (fi(0)).",

                "The heat M(i, j, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t and the heat difference fj(t) − fi(t).",
                "Moreover, the heat flows from node j to node i through the pipe that connects nodes i and j.",
                "Based on this consideration, we assume that M(i, j, t, ∆t) = γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t.",
                "As a result, the heat difference at node i between time t + ∆t and time t will be equal to the sum of the heat that it receives from all its neighbors.",
                "This is formulated as fi(t + ∆t) − fi(t) = j:(j,i)∈E γ(fj(t) − fi(t))∆t, (2) where E is the set of edges.",
