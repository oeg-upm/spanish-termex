Research, 2821 Mission College Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95054 {broder, marcusf, vanjaj, riedell}@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT Contextual advertising or Context Match (CM) refers to the placement of commercial textual advertisements within the content of a generic web page, while Sponsored Search (SS) advertising consists in placing ads on result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query. In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience. With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads. The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach. However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads. To overcome this problem, we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic features.

INTRODUCTION Web advertising supports a large swath of todays Internet ecosystem. The total internet advertiser spend in US alone in 2006 is estimated at over 17 billion dollars with a growth rate of almost 20% year over year. A large part of this market consists of textual ads, that is, short text messages usually marked as sponsored links or similar. The main advertising channels used to distribute textual ads are: 1. Sponsored Search or Paid Search advertising which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query. All major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) support such ads and act simultaneously as a search engine and an ad agency. 2. Contextual advertising or Context Match which refers to the placement of commercial ads within the content of a generic web page. In contextual advertising usually there is a commercial intermediary, called an ad-network, in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between publisher and ad-network) and improving user experience. Again, all major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) provide such ad-networking services but there are also many smaller players. The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. (See [5] for a brief history). However, today, almost all of the for-profit non-transactional web sites (that is, sites that do not sell anything directly) rely at least in part on revenue from context match. CM supports sites that range from individual bloggers and small niche communities to large publishers such as major newspapers. Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller! The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (pay-per-click or PPC). There are also other models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or similar transaction. For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper. Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks. This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g. Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13]. Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details). However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand. Another example could be a page describing the Chevy Tahoe truck (a popular vehicle in US) triggering an ad about Lake Tahoe vacations. Polysemy is not the only culprit: there is a (maybe apocryphal) story about a lurid news item about a headless body found in a suitcase triggering an ad for Samsonite luggage! In all these examples the mismatch arises from the fact that the ads are not appropriate for the context. In order to solve this problem we propose a matching mechanism that combines a semantic phase with the traditional keyword matching, that is, a syntactic phase. The semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula. Hence we favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach. Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page. For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports. In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy. The taxonomy contains nodes for topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital cameras, say Canon. The keywords capture the specificity to a level that is more dynamic and granular. In the digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life might be just a few months. Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers. In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience. In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered. Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain. To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match). We evaluated several classifiers and taxonomies and in this paper we present results using a taxonomy with close to 6000 nodes using a variation of the Rocchios classifier [9]. This classifier gave the best results in both page and ad classification, and ultimately in ad relevance. The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we review the basic principles of the contextual advertising. Section 3 overviews the related work. Section 4 describes the taxonomy and document classifier that were used for page and ad classification. Section 5 describes the semanticsyntactic method. In Section 6 we briefly discuss how to search efficiently the ad space in order to return the top-k ranked ads. Experimental evaluation is presented in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 presents the concluding remarks. 2. OVERVIEW OF CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING Contextual advertising is an interplay of four players: • The publisher is the owner of the web pages on which the advertising is displayed. The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads. Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season). As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages. The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads. Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction. One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response. Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC). The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network. Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query. In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid. Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases. The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM. However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8]. In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page. The ad-network model aligns the interests of the publishers, advertisers and the network. In general, clicks bring benefits to both the publisher and the ad network by providing revenue, and to the advertiser by bringing traffic to the target web site. The revenue of the network, given a page p, can be estimated as: R = X i=1..k P(click|p, ai)price(ai, i) where k is the number of ads displayed on page p and price(ai, i) is the click-price of the current ad ai at position i. The price in this model depends on the set of ads presented on the page. Several models have been proposed to determine the price, most of them based on generalizations of second price auctions. However, for simplicity we ignore the pricing model and concentrate on finding ads that will maximize the first term of the product, that is we search for arg max i P(click|p, ai) Furthermore we assume that the probability of click for a given ad and page is determined by its relevance score with respect to the page, thus ignoring the positional effect of the ad placement on the page. We assume that this is an orthogonal factor to the relevance component and could be easily incorporated in the model. 3. RELATED WORK Online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular are emerging areas of research. The published literature is very sparse. A study presented in [13] confirms the intuition that ads need to be relevant to the users interest to avoid degrading the users experience and increase the probability of reaction. A recent work by Ribeiro-Neto et. al. [8] examines a number of strategies to match pages to ads based on extracted keywords. The ads and pages are represented as vectors in a vector space. The first five strategies proposed in that work match the pages and the ads based on the cosine of the angle between the ad vector and the page vector. To find out the important part of the ad, the authors explore using different ad sections (bid phrase, title, body) as a basis for the ad vector. The winning strategy out of the first five requires the bid phrase to appear on the page and then ranks all such ads by the cosine of the union of all the ad sections and the page vectors. While both pages and ads are mapped to the same space, there is a discrepancy (impendence mismatch) between the vocabulary used in the ads and in the pages. Furthermore, since in the vector model the dimensions are determined by the number of unique words, plain cosine similarity will not take into account synonyms. To solve this problem, Ribeiro-Neto et al expand the page vocabulary with terms from other similar pages weighted based on the overall similarity of the origin page to the matched page, and show improved matching precision. In a follow-up work [7] the authors propose a method to learn impact of individual features using genetic programming to produce a matching function. The function is represented as a tree composed of arithmetic operators and the log function as internal nodes, and different numerical features of the query and ad terms as leafs. The results show that genetic programming finds matching functions that significantly improve the matching compared to the best method (without page side expansion) reported in [8]. Another approach to contextual advertising is to reduce it to the problem of sponsored search advertising by extracting phrases from the page and matching them with the bid phrase of the ads. In [14] a system for phrase extraction is described that used a variety of features to determine the importance of page phrases for advertising purposes. The system is trained with pages that have been hand annotated with important phrases. The learning algorithm takes into account features based on tf-idf, html meta data and query logs to detect the most important phrases. During evaluation, each page phrase up to length 5 is considered as potential result and evaluated against a trained classifier. In our work we also experimented with a phrase extractor based on the work reported in [12]. While increasing slightly the precision, it did not change the relative performance of the explored algorithms. 4. PAGE AND AD CLASSIFICATION 4.1 Taxonomy Choice The semantic match of the pages and the ads is performed by classifying both into a common taxonomy. The matching process requires that the taxonomy provides sufficient differentiation between the common commercial topics. For example, classifying all medical related pages into one node will not result into a good classification since both sore foot and flu pages will end up in the same node. The ads suitable for these two concepts are, however, very different. To obtain sufficient resolution, we used a taxonomy of around 6000 nodes primarily built for classifying commercial interest queries, rather than pages or ads. This taxonomy has been commercially built by Yahoo! US. We will explain below how we can use the same taxonomy to classify pages and ads as well. Each node in our source taxonomy is represented as a collection of exemplary bid phrases or queries that correspond to that node concept. Each node has on average around 100 queries. The queries placed in the taxonomy are high volume queries and queries of high interest to advertisers, as indicated by an unusually high cost-per-click (CPC) price. The taxonomy has been populated by human editors using keyword suggestions tools similar to the ones used by ad networks to suggest keywords to advertisers. After initial seeding with a few queries, using the provided tools a human editor can add several hundreds queries to a given node. Nevertheless, it has been a significant effort to develop this 6000-nodes taxonomy and it has required several person-years of work. A similar-in-spirit process for building enterprise taxonomies via queries has been presented in [6]. However, the details and tools are completely different. Figure 1 provides some statistics about the taxonomy used in this work. 4.2 Classification Method As explained, the semantic phase of the matching relies on ads and pages being topically close. Thus we need to classify pages into the same taxonomy used to classify ads. In this section we overview the methods we used to build a page and an ad classifier pair. The detailed description and evaluation of this process is outside the scope of this paper. Given the taxonomy of queries (or bid-phrases - we use these terms interchangeably) described in the previous section, we tried three methods to build corresponding page and ad classifiers. For the first two methods we tried to find exemplary pages and ads for each concept as follows: Number of Categories By Level 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Level NumberofCategories Number of Children per Nodes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 29 31 33 35 52 Number of Children NumberofNodes Queries per Node 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 1 50 80 120 160 200 240 280 320 360 400 440 480 Number Queries (up to 500+) NumberofNodes Figure 1: Taxonomy statistics: categories per level; fanout for non-leaf nodes; and queries per node We generated a page training set by running the queries in the taxonomy over a Web search index and using the top 10 results after some filtering as documents labeled with the querys label. On the ad side we generated a training set for each class by selecting the ads that have a bid phrase assigned to this class. Using this training sets we then trained a hierarchical SVM [2] (one against all between every group of siblings) and a log-regression [11] classifier. (The second method differs from the first in the type of secondary filtering used. This filtering eliminates low content pages, pages deemed unsuitable for advertising, pages that lead to excessive class confusion, etc.) However, we obtained the best performance by using the third document classifier, based on the information in the source taxonomy queries only. For each taxonomy node we concatenated all the exemplary queries into a single metadocument. We then used the meta document as a centroid for a nearest-neighbor classifier based on Rocchios framework [9] with only positive examples and no relevance feedback. Each centroid is defined as a sum of the tf-idf values of each term, normalized by the number of queries in the class cj = 1 |Cj| X q∈Cj q q where cj is the centroid for class Cj; q iterates over the queries in a particular class. The classification is based on the cosine of the angle between the document d and the centroid meta-documents: Cmax = arg max Cj ∈C cj cj · d d = arg max Cj ∈C P i∈|F | ci j· di qP i∈|F |(ci j)2 qP i∈|F |(di)2 where F is the set of features. The score is normalized by the document and class length to produce comparable score. The terms ci and di represent the weight of the ith feature in the class centroid and the document respectively. These weights are based on the standard tf-idf formula. As the score of the max class is normalized with regard to document length, the scores for different documents are comparable. We conducted tests using professional editors to judge the quality of page and ad class assignments. The tests showed that for both ads and pages the Rocchio classifier returned the best results, especially on the page side. This is probably a result of the noise induced by using a search engine to machine generate training pages for the SVM and logregression classifiers. It is an area of current investigation how to improve the classification using a noisy training set. Based on the test results we decided to use the Rocchios classifier on both the ad and the page side. 5. SEMANTIC-SYNTACTIC MATCHING Contextual advertising systems process the content of the page, extract features, and then search the ad space to find the best matching ads. Given a page p and a set of ads A = {a1 . . . as} we estimate the relative probability of click P(click|p, a) with a score that captures the quality of the match between the page and the ad. To find the best ads for a page we rank the ads in A and select the top few for display. The problem can be formally defined as matching every page in the set of all pages P = {p1, . . . ppc} to one or more ads in the set of ads. Each page is represented as a set of page sections pi = {pi,1, pi,2 . . . pi,m}. The sections of the page represent different structural parts, such as title, metadata, body, headings, etc. In turn, each section is an unordered bag of terms (keywords). A page is represented by the union of the terms in each section: pi = {pws1 1 , pws1 2 . . . pwsi m} where pw stands for a page word and the superscript indicates the section of each term. A term can be a unigram or a phrase extracted by a phrase extractor [12]. Similarly, we represent each ad as a set of sections a = {a1, a2, . . . al}, each section in turn being an unordered set of terms: ai = {aws1 1 , aws1 2 . . . awsj l } where aw is an ad word. The ads in our experiments have 3 sections: title, body, and bid phrase. In this work, to produce the match score we use only the ad/page textual information, leaving user information and other data for future work. Next, each page and ad term is associated with a weight based on the tf-idf values. The tf value is determined based on the individual ad sections. There are several choices for the value of idf, based on different scopes. On the ad side, it has been shown in previous work that the set of ads of one campaign provide good scope for the estimation of idf that leads to improved matching results [8]. However, in this work for simplicity we do not take into account campaigns. To combine the impact of the terms section and its tf-idf score, the ad/page term weight is defined as: tWeight(kwsi ) = weightSection(Si) · tf idf(kw) where tWeight stands for term weight and weightSection(Si) is the weight assigned to a page or ad section. This weight is a fixed parameter determined by experimentation. Each ad and page is classified into the topical taxonomy. We define these two mappings: Tax(pi) = {pci1, . . . pciu} Tax(aj) = {acj1 . . . acjv} where pc and ac are page and ad classes correspondingly. Each assignment is associated with a weight given by the classifier. The weights are normalized to sum to 1: X c∈T ax(xi) cWeight(c) = 1 where xi is either a page or an ad, and cWeights(c) is the class weight - normalized confidence assigned by the classifier. The number of classes can vary between different pages and ads. This corresponds to the number of topics a page/ad can be associated with and is almost always in the range 1-4. Now we define the relevance score of an ad ai and page pi as a convex combination of the keyword (syntactic) and classification (semantic) score: Score(pi, ai) = α · TaxScore(Tax(pi), Tax(ai)) +(1 − α) · KeywordScore(pi, ai) The parameter α determines the relative weight of the taxonomy score and the keyword score. To calculate the keyword score we use the vector space model [1] where both the pages and ads are represented in n-dimensional space - one dimension for each distinct term. The magnitude of each dimension is determined by the tWeight() formula. The keyword score is then defined as the cosine of the angle between the page and the ad vectors: KeywordScore(pi, ai) = P i∈|K| tWeight(pwi)· tWeight(awi) qP i∈|K|(tWeight(pwi))2 qP i∈|K|(tWeight(awi))2 where K is the set of all the keywords. The formula assumes independence between the words in the pages and ads. Furthermore, it ignores the order and the proximity of the terms in the scoring. We experimented with the impact of phrases and proximity on the keyword score and did not see a substantial impact of these two factors. We now turn to the definition of the TaxScore. This function indicates the topical match between a given ad and a page. As opposed to the keywords that are treated as independent dimensions, here the classes (topics) are organized into a hierarchy. One of the goals in the design of the TaxScore function is to be able to generalize within the taxonomy, that is accept topically related ads. Generalization can help to place ads in cases when there is no ad that matches both the category and the keywords of the page. The example in Figure 2 illustrates this situation. In this example, in the absence of ski ads, a page about skiing containing the word Atomic could be matched to the available snowboarding ad for the same brand. In general we would like the match to be stronger when both the ad and the page are classified into the same node Figure 2: Two generalization paths and weaker when the distance between the nodes in the taxonomy gets larger. There are multiple ways to specify the distance between two taxonomy nodes. Besides the above requirement, this function should lend itself to an efficient search of the ad space. Given a page we have to find the ad in a few milliseconds, as this impacts the presentation to a waiting user. This will be further discussed in the next section. To capture both the generalization and efficiency requirements we define the TaxScore function as follows: TaxScore(PC, AC) = X pc∈P C X ac∈AC idist(LCA(pc, ac), ac)·cWeight(pc)·cWeight(ac) In this function we consider every combination of page class and ad class. For each combination we multiply the product of the class weights with the inverse distance function between the least common ancestor of the two classes (LCA) and the ad class. The inverse distance function idist(c1, c2) takes two nodes on the same path in the class taxonomy and returns a number in the interval [0, 1] depending on the distance of the two class nodes. It returns 1 if the two nodes are the same, and declines toward 0 when LCA(pc, ac) or ac is the root of the taxonomy. The rate of decline determines the weight of the generalization versus the other terms in the scoring formula. To determine the rate of decline we consider the impact on the specificity of the match when we substitute a class with one of its ancestors. In general the impact is topic dependent. For example the node Hobby in our taxonomy has tens of children, each representing a different hobby, two examples being Sailing and Knitting. Placing an ad about Knitting on a page about Sailing does not make lots of sense. However, in the Winter Sports example above, in the absence of better alternative, skiing ads could be put on snowboarding pages as they might promote the same venues, equipment vendors etc. Such detailed analysis on a case by case basis is prohibitively expensive due to the size of the taxonomy. One option is to use the confidences of the ancestor classes as given by the classifier. However we found these numbers not suitable for this purpose as the magnitude of the confidences does not necessarily decrease when going up the tree. Another option is to use explore-exploit methods based on machine-learning from the click feedback as described in [10]. However for simplicity, in this work we chose a simple heuristic to determine the cost of generalization from a child to a parent. In this heuristic we look at the broadening of the scope when moving from a child to a parent. We estimate the broadening by the density of ads classified in the parent nodes vs the child node. The density is obtained by classifying a large set of ads in the taxonomy using the document classifier described above. Based on this, let nc be the number of document classified into the subtree rooted at c. Then we define: idist(c, p) = nc np where c represents the child node and p is the parent node. This fraction can be viewed as a probability of an ad belonging to the parent topic being suitable for the child topic. 6. SEARCHING THE AD SPACE In the previous section we discussed the choice of scoring function to estimate the match between an ad and a page. The top-k ads with the highest score are offered by the system for placement on the publishers page. The process of score calculation and ad selection is to be done in real time and therefore must be very efficient. As the ad collections are in the range of hundreds of millions of entries, there is a need for indexed access to the ads. Inverted indexes provide scalable and low latency solutions for searching documents. However, these have been traditionally used to search based on keywords. To be able to search the ads on a combination of keywords and classes we have mapped the classification match to term match and adapted the scoring function to be suitable for fast evaluation over inverted indexes. In this section we overview the ad indexing and the ranking function of our prototype ad search system for matching ads and pages. We used a standard inverted index framework where there is one posting list for each distinct term. The ads are parsed into terms and each term is associated with a weight based on the section in which it appears. Weights from distinct occurrences of a term in an ad are added together, so that the posting lists contain one entry per term/ad combination. The next challenge is how to index the ads so that the class information is preserved in the index? A simple method is to create unique meta-terms for the classes and annotate each ad with one meta-term for each assigned class. However this method does not allow for generalization, since only the ads matching an exact label of the page would be selected. Therefore we annotated each ad with one meta-term for each ancestor of the assigned class. The weights of meta-terms are assigned according to the value of the idist() function defined in the previous section. On the query side, given the keywords and the class of a page, we compose a keyword only query by inserting one class term for each ancestor of the classes assigned to the page. The scoring function is adapted to the two part scoreone for the class meta-terms and another for the text term. During the class score calculation, for each class path we use only the lowest class meta-term, ignoring the others. For example, if an ad belongs to the Skiing class and is annotated with both Skiing and its parent Winter Sports, the index will contain the special class meta-terms for both Skiing and Winter Sports (and all their ancestors) with the weights according to the product of the classifier confidence and the idist function. When matching with a page classified into Skiing, the query will contain terms for class Skiing and for each of its ancestors. However when scoring an ad classified into Skiing we will use the weight for the Skiing class meta-term. Ads classified into Snowboarding will be scored using the weight of the Winter Sports meta-term. To make this check efficiently we keep a sorted list of all the class paths and, at scoring time, we search the paths bottom up for a meta-term appearing in the ad. The first meta-term is used for scoring, the rest are ignored. At runtime, we evaluate the query using a variant of the WAND algorithm [3]. This is a document-at-a-time algorithm [1] that uses a branch-and-bound approach to derive efficient moves for the cursors associated to the postings lists. It finds the next cursor to be moved based on an upper bound of the score for the documents at which the cursors are currently positioned. The algorithm keeps a heap of current best candidates. Documents with an upper bound smaller than the current minimum score among the candidate documents can be eliminated from further considerations, and thus the cursors can skip over them. To find the upper bound for a document, the algorithm assumes that all cursors that are before it will hit this document (i.e. the document contains all those terms represented by cursors before or at that document). It has been shown that WAND can be used with any function that is monotonic with respect to the number of matching terms in the document. Our scoring function is monotonic since the score can never decrease when more terms are found in the document. In the special case when we add a cursor representing an ancestor of a class term already factored in the score, the score simply does not change (we add 0). Given these properties, we use an adaptation of the WAND algorithm where we change the calculation of the scoring function and the upper bound score calculation to reflect our scoring function. The rest of the algorithm remains unchanged. 7. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION 7.1 Data and Methodology We quantify the effect of the semantic-syntactic matching using a set of 105 pages. This set of pages was selected by a random sample of a larger set of around 20 million pages with contextual advertising. Ads for each of these pages have been selected from a larger pool of ads (tens of millions) by previous experiments conducted by Yahoo! US for other purposes. Each page-ad pair has been judged by three or more human judges on a 1 to 3 scale: 1. Relevant The ad is semantically directly related to the main subject of the page. For example if the page is about the National Football League and the ad is about tickets for NFL games, it would be scored as 1. 2. Somewhat relevant The ad is related to the secondary subject of the page, or is related to the main topic of the page in a general way. In the NFL page example, an ad about NFL branded products would be judged as 2. 3. Irrelevant The ad is unrelated to the page. For example a mention of the NFL player John Maytag triggers washing machine ads on a NFL page. pages 105 words per page 868 judgments 2946 judg. inter-editor agreement 84% unique ads 2680 unique ads per page 25.5 page classification precision 70% ad classification precision 86% Table 1: Dataset statistics To obtain a score for a page-ad pair we average all the scores and then round to the closest integer. We then used these judgments to evaluate how well our methods distinguish the positive and the negative ad assignments for each page. The statistics of the page dataset is given in Table 1. The original experiments that paired the pages and the ads are loosely related to the syntactic keyword based matching and classification based assignment but used different taxonomies and keyword extraction techniques. Therefore we could not use standard pooling as an evaluation method since we did not control the way the pairs were selected and could not precisely establish the set of ads from which the placed ads were selected. Instead, in our evaluation for each page we consider only those ads for which we have judgment. Each different method was applied to this set and the ads were ranked by the score. The relative effectiveness of the algorithms were judged by comparing how well the methods separated the ads with positive judgment from the ads with negative judgment. We present precision on various levels of recall within this set. As the set of ads per page is relatively small, the evaluation reports precision that is higher than it would be with a larger set of negative ads. However, these numbers still establish the relative performance of the algorithms and we can use it to evaluate performance at different score thresholds. In addition to the precision-recall over the judged ads, we also present Kendalls τ rank correlation coefficient to establish how far from the perfect ordering are the orderings produced by our ranking algorithms. For this test we ranked the judged ads by the scores assigned by the judges and then compared this order to the order assigned by our algorithms. Finally we also examined the precision at position 1, 3 and 5. 7.2 Results Figure 3 shows the precision recall curves for the syntactic matching (keywords only used) vs. a syntactic-semantic matching with the optimal value of α = 0.8 (judged by the 11-point score [1]). In this figure, we assume that the adpage pairs judged with 1 or 2 are positive examples and the 3s are negative examples. We also examined counting only the pairs judged with 1 as positive examples and did not find a significant change in the relative performance of the tested methods. Overlaid are also results using phrases in the keyword match. We see that these additional features do not change the relative performance of the algorithm. The graphs show significant impact of the class information, especially in the mid range of recall values. In the low recall part of the chart the curves meet. This indicates that when the keyword match is really strong (i.e. when the ad is almost contained within the page) the precision 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recall Precision Alpha=.9, no phrase Alpha=0, no phrase Alpha=0, phrase Alpha=.9, phrase Figure 3: Data Set 2: Precision vs. Recall of syntactic match (α = 0) vs. syntactic-semantic match (α = 0.8) α Kendalls τ α = 0 0.086 α = 0.25 0.155 α = 0.50 0.166 α = 0.75 0.158 α = 1 0.136 Table 2: Kendalls τ for different α values of the syntactic keyword match is comparable with that of the semantic-syntactic match. Note however that the two methods might produce different ads and could be used as a complement at level of recall. The semantic components provides largest lift in precision at the mid range of recall where 25% improvement is achieved by using the class information for ad placement. This means that when there is somewhat of a match between the ad and the page, the restriction to the right classes provides a better scope for selecting the ads. Table 2 shows the Kendalls τ values for different values of α. We calculated the values by ranking all the judged ads for each page and averaging the values over all the pages. The ads with tied judgment were given the rank of the middle position. The results show that when we take into account all the ad-page pairs, the optimal value of α is around 0.5. Note that purely syntactic match (α = 0) is by far the weakest method. Figure 4 shows the effect of the parameter α in the scoring. We see that in most cases precision grows or is flat when we increase α, except at the low level of recall where due to small number of data points there is a bit of jitter in the results. Table 3 shows the precision at positions 1, 3 and 5. Again, the purely syntactic method has clearly the lowest score by individual positions and the total number of correctly placed ads. The numbers are close due to the small number of the ads considered, but there are still some noticeable trends. For position 1 the optimal α is in the range of 0.25 to 0.75. For positions 3 and 5 the optimum is at α = 1. This also indicates that for those ads that have a very high keyword score, the semantic information is somewhat less important. If almost all the words in an ad appear in the page, this ad is Precision Vs Alpha for Different Levels of Recall (Data Set 2) 0.45 0.55 0.65 0.75 0.85 0.95 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Alpha Precision 80% Recall 60% Recall 40% Recall 20% Recall Figure 4: Impact of α on precision for different levels of recall α #1 #3 #5 sum α = 0 80 70 68 218 α = 0.25 89 76 73 238 α = 0.5 89 74 73 236 α = 0.75 89 78 73 240 α = 1 86 79 74 239 Table 3: Precision at position 1, 3 and 5 likely to be relevant for this page. However when there is no such clear affinity, the class information becomes a dominant factor. 8. CONCLUSION Contextual advertising is the economic engine behind a large number of non-transactional sites on the Web. Studies have shown that one of the main success factors for contextual ads is their relevance to the surrounding content. All existing commercial contextual match solutions known to us evolved from search advertising solutions whereby a search query is matched to the bid phrase of the ads. A natural extension of search advertising is to extract phrases from the page and match them to the bid phrase of the ads. However, individual phrases and words might have multiple meanings and/or be unrelated to the overall topic of the page leading to miss-matched ads. In this paper we proposed a novel way of matching advertisements to web pages that rely on a topical (semantic) match as a major component of the relevance score. The semantic match relies on the classification of pages and ads into a 6000 nodes commercial advertising taxonomy to determine their topical distance. As the classification relies on the full content of the page, it is more robust than individual page phrases. The semantic match is complemented with a syntactic match and the final score is a convex combination of the two sub-scores with the relative weight of each determined by a parameter α. We evaluated the semantic-syntactic approach against a syntactic approach over a set of pages with different contextual advertising. As shown in our experimental evaluation, the optimal value of the parameter α depends on the precise objective of optimization (precision at particular position, precision at given recall). However in all cases the optimal value of α is between 0.25 and 0.9 indicating significant effect of the semantic score component. The effectiveness of the syntactic match depends on the quality of the pages used. In lower quality pages we are more likely to make classification errors that will then negatively impact the matching. We demonstrated that it is feasible to build a large scale classifier that has sufficient good precision for this application. We are currently examining how to employ machine learning algorithms to learn the optimal value of α based on a collection of features of the input pages. 9. REFERENCES [1] R. Baeza-Yates and B.

Research, 2821 Mission College Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95054 {Broder, Marcusf, Vanjaj, riedell}@yahoo-inc.com Abstract Contextual Advertising o context Match (CM) se refiere a la colocación de anuncios textuales comerciales dentro del contenido de un genéricoPágina web, mientras que la publicidad de búsqueda patrocinada (SS) consiste en colocar anuncios en las páginas de resultados desde un motor de búsqueda web, con anuncios impulsados por la consulta de origen. En CM, generalmente hay una entidad intermediaria comercial de redes publicitarias a cargo de optimizar la selección de anuncios con el objetivo gemelo de aumentar los ingresos (compartido entre el editor y la red publicitaria) y mejorar la experiencia del usuario. Con estos objetivos en mente, es preferible tener anuncios relevantes para el contenido de la página, en lugar de anuncios genéricos. El mercado SS se desarrolló más rápido que el mercado CM, y la mayoría de los anuncios textuales todavía se caracterizan por frases de oferta que representan esas consultas donde los anunciantes desean que se muestren su anuncio. Por lo tanto, las primeras tecnologías para CM se han basado en soluciones anteriores para SS, simplemente extrayendo una o más frases del contenido de la página dado y mostrando anuncios correspondientes a búsquedas en estas frases, en un enfoque puramente sintáctico. Sin embargo, debido a los caprichos de la extracción de frases y la falta de contexto, este enfoque conduce a muchos anuncios irrelevantes. Para superar este problema, proponemos un sistema para la coincidencia de AD contextual basada en una combinación de características semánticas y sintácticas. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos: H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y recuperación de información]: Proceso de selección Términos generales: algoritmos, medición, rendimiento, experimentación 1. Introducción La publicidad web admite una gran franja del ecosistema de Internet de hoy. El gasto total del anunciante de Internet en EE. UU. En 2006 se estima en más de 17 mil millones de dólares con una tasa de crecimiento de casi el 20% año tras año. Una gran parte de este mercado consiste en anuncios textuales, es decir, mensajes de texto cortos generalmente marcados como enlaces patrocinados o similares. Los principales canales de publicidad utilizados para distribuir anuncios textuales son: 1. Search o publicidad de búsqueda de pago patrocinado que consiste en colocar anuncios en las páginas de resultados de un motor de búsqueda web, con anuncios impulsados por la consulta de origen. Todos los principales motores de búsqueda web actuales (Google, Yahoo!, Y Microsoft) admiten tales anuncios y actúan simultáneamente como un motor de búsqueda y una agencia de publicidad.2. La publicidad contextual o la coincidencia de contexto que se refiere a la colocación de anuncios comerciales dentro del contenido de una página web genérica. En la publicidad contextual, generalmente hay un intermediario comercial, llamado Network AD, a cargo de optimizar la selección de anuncios con el objetivo gemelo de aumentar los ingresos (compartido entre el editor y la red AD) y mejorar la experiencia del usuario. Una vez más, todos los principales motores de búsqueda web actuales (Google, Yahoo!, Y Microsoft) proporcionan dichos servicios de networking de anuncios, pero también hay muchos reproductores más pequeños. El mercado SS se desarrolló más rápido que el mercado CM, y la mayoría de los anuncios textuales todavía se caracterizan por frases de oferta que representan esas consultas donde los anunciantes desean que se muestren su anuncio.(Ver [5] para una breve historia). Sin embargo, hoy, casi todos los sitios web no transaccionales con fines de lucro (es decir, los sitios que no venden nada directamente) dependen al menos en parte de los ingresos de la coincidencia de contexto. CM admite sitios que van desde bloggers individuales y comunidades de nicho pequeños hasta grandes editores, como los principales periódicos. Sin este modelo, ¡la web sería mucho más pequeña! El modelo de precios prevalente para anuncios textuales es que los anunciantes pagan una cierta cantidad por cada clic en el anuncio (pago por clic o PPC). También se utilizan otros modelos: pago por impresión, donde los anunciantes pagan por el número de exposiciones de un anuncio y pago por acción donde el anunciante paga solo si el anuncio conduce a una venta o transacción similar. Para simplificar, solo tratamos con el modelo PPC en este documento. Dada una página, en lugar de colocar anuncios genéricos, parece preferible tener anuncios relacionados con el contenido para proporcionar una mejor experiencia del usuario y, por lo tanto, aumentar la probabilidad de clics. Esta intuición está respaldada por la analogía con la publicación convencional donde hay revistas muy exitosas (p. Vogue) donde la mayoría del contenido es publicidad tópica (moda en el caso de la bóvenes) y por estudios de usuarios que han confirmado que una mayor relevancia aumenta el número de clics en anuncios [4, 13]. Los enfoques publicados anteriores estimaron la relevancia de AD basada en la concurrencia de las mismas palabras o frases dentro de la AD y dentro de la página (ver [7, 8] y la Sección 3 para obtener más detalles). Sin embargo, los mecanismos de orientación basados únicamente en las frases que se encuentran dentro del texto de la página pueden conducir a problemas: por ejemplo, una página sobre un famoso golfista llamado John Maytag podría desencadenar un anuncio para los lavavajillas Maytag ya que Maytag es una marca popular. Otro ejemplo podría ser una página que describe el camión Chevy Tahoe (un vehículo popular en Estados Unidos) que desencadena un anuncio sobre las vacaciones del lago Tahoe. Polisemy no es el único culpable: ¡hay una historia (tal vez apócrifa) sobre una noticia espeluznante sobre un cuerpo sin cabeza que se encuentra en una maleta que desencadena un anuncio para el equipaje samsonite! En todos estos ejemplos, el desajuste surge del hecho de que los anuncios no son apropiados para el contexto. Para resolver este problema, proponemos un mecanismo de coincidencia que combine una fase semántica con la coincidencia tradicional de palabras clave, es decir, una fase sintáctica. La fase semántica clasifica la página y los anuncios en una taxonomía de temas y utiliza la proximidad de las clases de anuncios y páginas como factor en la fórmula de clasificación AD. Por lo tanto, favorecemos los anuncios que están relacionados tópicamente con la página y, por lo tanto, evitamos las dificultades del enfoque puramente sintáctico. Además, al usar una taxonomía jerárquica, permitimos la generalización gradual del espacio de búsqueda de anuncios en el caso de que no hay anuncios que coincidan con el tema preciso de la página. Por ejemplo, si la página se trata de un evento en el curling, un deporte de invierno raro, y contiene las palabras alpinas prados, el sistema aún clasificaría altamente anuncios para esquiar en prados alpinos, ya que estos anuncios pertenecen al esquí de clase que es un hermano delEl curling de clase y ambas clases comparten los deportes de invierno de los padres. En cierto sentido, las clases de taxonomía se utilizan para seleccionar el conjunto de anuncios aplicables y las palabras clave se utilizan para reducir la búsqueda de conceptos que son de granularidad demasiado pequeña para estar en la taxonomía. La taxonomía contiene nodos para temas que no cambian rápido, por ejemplo, marcas de cámaras digitales, dicen Canon. Las palabras clave capturan la especificidad a un nivel que es más dinámico y granular. En el ejemplo de la cámara digital, esto correspondería al nivel de un modelo en particular, por ejemplo, Canon SD450 cuya vida publicitaria podría ser solo unos pocos meses. La actualización de la taxonomía con nuevos nodos o incluso el nuevo vocabulario cada vez que un nuevo modelo llega al mercado es prohibitivamente costoso cuando tratamos con millones de fabricantes. Además del aumento de la tasa de clics (CTR) debido a una mayor relevancia, un beneficio significativo pero más difícil de cuantificar el beneficio de la coincidencia semántica-sintáctica es que la página resultante tiene una sensación unificada y mejora la experiencia del usuario. En el ejemplo de Chevy Tahoe anterior, el clasificador establecería que la página trata sobre automóviles/automotriz y solo se considerarán esos anuncios. Incluso si no hay anuncios para este modelo Chevy en particular, los anuncios elegidos seguirán dentro del dominio automotriz. Para implementar nuestro enfoque, necesitamos resolver un problema desafiante: clasificar tanto las páginas como los anuncios dentro de una gran taxonomía (para que la granularidad del tema sea lo suficientemente pequeña) con alta precisión (para reducir la probabilidad de incorrecto). Evaluamos varios clasificadores y taxonomías y en este documento presentamos resultados utilizando una taxonomía con cerca de 6000 nodos utilizando una variación del clasificador Rocchios [9]. Este clasificador dio los mejores resultados en la clasificación de la página y el anuncio, y en última instancia en relevancia publicitaria. El documento procede de la siguiente manera. En la siguiente sección revisamos los principios básicos de la publicidad contextual. La Sección 3 resumen el trabajo relacionado. La Sección 4 describe el clasificador de taxonomía y documento que se utilizaron para la clasificación de página y publicidad. La Sección 5 describe el método semánticointáctico. En la Sección 6 discutimos brevemente cómo buscar eficientemente el espacio de anuncios para devolver los anuncios clasificados por Top-K. La evaluación experimental se presenta en la Sección 7. Finalmente, la Sección 8 presenta los comentarios finales.2. Descripción general de la publicidad contextual La publicidad contextual es una interacción de cuatro jugadores: • El editor es el propietario de las páginas web en las que se muestra la publicidad. El editor generalmente tiene como objetivo maximizar los ingresos por publicidad al tiempo que proporciona una buena experiencia de usuario.• El anunciante proporciona el suministro de anuncios. Por lo general, la actividad de los anunciantes se organiza en torno a campañas que se definen por un conjunto de anuncios con un objetivo temporal y temático particular (por ejemplo, venta de cámaras digitales durante la temporada de vacaciones). Como en la publicidad tradicional, el objetivo de los anunciantes se puede definir ampliamente como la promoción de productos o servicios.• La red publicitaria es un mediador entre el anunciante y el editor y selecciona los anuncios que se colocan en las páginas. La red publicitaria comparte los ingresos publicitarios con el editor.• Los usuarios visitan las páginas web del editor e interactúan con los anuncios. La publicidad contextual generalmente cae en la categoría de marketing directo (en oposición a la publicidad de marca), es decir, la publicidad cuyo objetivo es una respuesta directa en la que el efecto de una campaña se mide por la reacción del usuario. Una de las ventajas de la publicidad en línea en la publicidad general y contextual en particular es que, en comparación con los medios tradicionales, es relativamente fácil medir la respuesta del usuario. Por lo general, la reacción inmediata deseada es que el usuario siga el enlace en el anuncio y visite el sitio web de los anunciantes y, como se señaló, el modelo financiero prevalente es que el anunciante paga una cierta cantidad por cada clic en el anuncio (PPC). Los ingresos se comparten entre el editor y la red. La publicidad de coincidencia de contexto ha aumentado de la publicidad de búsqueda patrocinada, que consiste en colocar anuncios en las páginas de resultados de un motor de búsqueda web, con anuncios impulsados por la consulta de origen. En la mayoría de las redes, el monto pagado por el anunciante para cada clic SS está determinado por un proceso de subasta donde los anunciantes colocan ofertas en una frase de búsqueda, y su posición en la torre de anuncios que se muestra junto con el resultado está determinado por su oferta. Por lo tanto, cada anuncio se anota con una o más frases de oferta. La frase de oferta no tiene una relación directa con la colocación de anuncios en CM. Sin embargo, es una descripción concisa de la audiencia publicitaria objetivo según lo determine el anunciante y se ha demostrado que es una característica importante para la colocación exitosa de AD CM [8]. Además de la frase de oferta, un anuncio también se caracteriza por un título generalmente que se muestra en una fuente en negrita, y un resumen o creativo, que son las pocas líneas de texto, generalmente menos de 120 caracteres, que se muestran en la página. El modelo AD-Network alinea los intereses de los editores, anunciantes y la red. En general, los clics aportan beneficios tanto al editor como a la red publicitaria al proporcionar ingresos y al anunciante al llevar el tráfico al sitio web objetivo. Los ingresos de la red, dado una página P, se pueden estimar como: r = x i = 1..k p (hacer clic | p, ai) precio (ai, i) donde k es el número de anuncios que se muestran en la página Py el precio (ai, i) es el precio de clic del anuncio actual en la posición i. El precio en este modelo depende del conjunto de anuncios presentados en la página. Se han propuesto varios modelos para determinar el precio, la mayoría de ellos basados en generalizaciones de subastas de segundos de precios. Sin embargo, por simplicidad ignoramos el modelo de precios y nos concentramos en encontrar anuncios que maximizarán el primer término del producto, es decir, buscamos arg max i p (hacer clic | p, ai) además asumimos que la probabilidad de hacer clic para unDado AD y Page están determinados por su puntaje de relevancia con respecto a la página, ignorando así el efecto posicional de la colocación de AD en la página. Suponemos que este es un factor ortogonal para el componente de relevancia y podría incorporarse fácilmente en el modelo.3. Trabajo relacionado publicidad en línea en general y publicidad contextual en particular son áreas emergentes de investigación. La literatura publicada es muy escasa. Un estudio presentado en [13] confirma la intuición de que los anuncios deben ser relevantes para el interés de los usuarios para evitar degradar la experiencia de los usuarios y aumentar la probabilidad de reacción. Un trabajo reciente de Ribeiro-Neto et.Alabama.[8] examina una serie de estrategias para igualar las páginas con anuncios basados en palabras clave extraídas. Los anuncios y las páginas se representan como vectores en un espacio vectorial. Las primeras cinco estrategias propuestas en ese trabajo coinciden con las páginas y los anuncios basados en el coseno del ángulo entre el vector AD y el vector de página. Para averiguar la parte importante del anuncio, los autores exploran el uso de diferentes secciones de anuncios (frase de oferta, título, cuerpo) como base para el Vector AD. La estrategia ganadora de los primeros cinco requiere que la frase de oferta aparezca en la página y luego clasifica todos esos anuncios por el coseno de la unión de todas las secciones de anuncios y los vectores de la página. Si bien tanto las páginas como los anuncios se asignan al mismo espacio, hay una discrepancia (desajuste de impendencia) entre el vocabulario utilizado en los anuncios y en las páginas. Además, dado que en el modelo vectorial las dimensiones están determinadas por el número de palabras únicas, la similitud de coseno simple no tendrá en cuenta los sinónimos. Para resolver este problema, Ribeiro-Neto et al expanden el vocabulario de la página con términos de otras páginas similares ponderadas en función de la similitud general de la página de origen a la página coincidente, y muestran una precisión coincidente mejorada. En un trabajo de seguimiento [7], los autores proponen un método para aprender el impacto de las características individuales utilizando la programación genética para producir una función coincidente. La función se representa como un árbol compuesto por operadores aritméticos y la función logarítmica como nodos internos, y diferentes características numéricas de la consulta y los términos de AD como Leafs. Los resultados muestran que la programación genética encuentra funciones coincidentes que mejoran significativamente la coincidencia en comparación con el mejor método (sin expansión del lado de la página) informadas en [8]. Otro enfoque de la publicidad contextual es reducirlo al problema de la publicidad de búsqueda patrocinada extrayendo frases de la página y coincidirlas con la frase de oferta de los anuncios. En [14] se describe un sistema para la extracción de frases que utilizó una variedad de características para determinar la importancia de las frases de página para fines publicitarios. El sistema está entrenado con páginas que han sido anotadas a mano con frases importantes. El algoritmo de aprendizaje tiene en cuenta las características basadas en TF-IDF, meta datos HTML y registros de consultas para detectar las frases más importantes. Durante la evaluación, cada frase de página hasta la longitud 5 se considera un resultado potencial y se evalúa contra un clasificador capacitado. En nuestro trabajo también experimentamos con un extractor de frases basado en el trabajo reportado en [12]. Si bien aumentó ligeramente la precisión, no cambió el rendimiento relativo de los algoritmos explorados.4. Clasificación de la página y AD 4.1 Elección de la taxonomía La coincidencia semántica de las páginas y los anuncios se realiza clasificando ambos en una taxonomía común. El proceso de correspondencia requiere que la taxonomía proporcione suficiente diferenciación entre los temas comerciales comunes. Por ejemplo, la clasificación de todas las páginas relacionadas con la médica en un nodo no dará como resultado una buena clasificación, ya que tanto las páginas doloridas como la gripe terminarán en el mismo nodo. Sin embargo, los anuncios adecuados para estos dos conceptos son muy diferentes. Para obtener una resolución suficiente, utilizamos una taxonomía de alrededor de 6000 nodos construidos principalmente para clasificar las consultas de intereses comerciales, en lugar de páginas o anuncios. Esta taxonomía ha sido construida comercialmente por Yahoo! Explicaremos a continuación cómo podemos usar la misma taxonomía para clasificar las páginas y anuncios también. Cada nodo en nuestra taxonomía de origen se representa como una colección de frases o consultas de oferta ejemplares que corresponden a ese concepto de nodo. Cada nodo tiene en promedio alrededor de 100 consultas. Las consultas colocadas en la taxonomía son consultas de alto volumen y consultas de alto interés para los anunciantes, como lo indican un precio inusualmente alto de costo por clic (CPC). La taxonomía ha sido poblada por editores humanos que utilizan herramientas de sugerencias de palabras clave similares a las utilizadas por las redes de anuncios para sugerir palabras clave a los anunciantes. Después de la siembra inicial con algunas consultas, utilizando las herramientas proporcionadas, un editor humano puede agregar varios cientos de consultas a un nodo dado. Sin embargo, ha sido un esfuerzo significativo desarrollar esta taxonomía de 6000 nodos y ha requerido varios años de trabajo. En [6] se ha presentado un proceso similar en espíritu para construir taxonomías empresariales a través de consultas. Sin embargo, los detalles y las herramientas son completamente diferentes. La Figura 1 proporciona algunas estadísticas sobre la taxonomía utilizada en este trabajo.4.2 Método de clasificación Como se explica, la fase semántica de la coincidencia se basa en anuncios y páginas que están tópicamente. Por lo tanto, necesitamos clasificar las páginas en la misma taxonomía utilizada para clasificar los anuncios. En esta sección, descrita los métodos que utilizamos para construir una página y un par clasificador de anuncios. La descripción detallada y la evaluación de este proceso están fuera del alcance de este documento. Dada la taxonomía de las consultas (o las frases de ofertas, utilizamos estos términos indistintamente) descrita en la sección anterior, probamos tres métodos para crear clasificadores de página y AD correspondientes. Para los dos primeros métodos, intentamos encontrar páginas y anuncios ejemplares para cada concepto de la siguiente manera: Número de categorías por nivel 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Número de niveles de categorías Número de niños PER porNodos 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 29 31 33 35 52 Número de niños Consultas de Número de Nodos por nodo 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 1 50 80 120 160 200 240 280 280320 360 400 440 480 Consultas de números (hasta 500+) Número de Nodos Figura 1: Estadísticas de taxonomía: categorías por nivel;Baroteo para nodos no hojas;y consultas por nodo generamos una capacitación de página establecida ejecutando las consultas en la taxonomía a través de un índice de búsqueda web y utilizando los 10 resultados principales después de algunos filtrados como documentos etiquetados con la etiqueta de consultas. En el lado del anuncio generamos un conjunto de capacitación para cada clase seleccionando los anuncios que tienen una frase de oferta asignada a esta clase. Usando estos conjuntos de entrenamiento, capacitamos un SVM jerárquico [2] (uno contra todos entre cada grupo de hermanos) y un clasificador de regresión de registro [11].(El segundo método difiere del primero en el tipo de filtrado secundario utilizado. Este filtrado elimina páginas de bajo contenido, páginas que se consideran inadecuadas para la publicidad, páginas que conducen a una confusión excesiva de clase, etc.) Sin embargo, obtuvimos el mejor desempeño utilizando el tercer clasificador de documentos, basado en la información en las consultas de taxonomía de origen solamente. Para cada nodo de taxonomía, concatenamos todas las consultas ejemplares en un solo metadocumento. Luego utilizamos el Meta Document como centroide para un clasificador de vecino más cercano basado en el marco Rocchios [9] con solo ejemplos positivos y sin retroalimentación de relevancia. Cada centroide se define como una suma de los valores de TF-IDF de cada término, normalizado por el número de consultas en la clase CJ = 1 | CJ |X q∈Cj q q donde cj es el centroide para la clase CJ;Q itera sobre las consultas en una clase en particular. La clasificación se basa en el coseno del ángulo entre el documento D y los metadocumentos del centroide: cmax = arg max cj ∈C cj cj · d d = arg max cj ∈C p i∈ | f |ci j · di qp i∈ | f | (ci j) 2 qp i∈ | f | (di) 2 donde f es el conjunto de características. El puntaje se normaliza mediante el documento y la longitud de la clase para producir una puntuación comparable. Los términos CI y DI representan el peso de la función I -IH en el centroide de clase y el documento respectivamente. Estos pesos se basan en la fórmula estándar de TF-IDF. Como la puntuación de la clase MAX se normaliza con respecto a la longitud del documento, los puntajes para diferentes documentos son comparables. Realizamos pruebas utilizando editores profesionales para juzgar la calidad de las tareas de clase y publicidad. Las pruebas mostraron que tanto para los anuncios como para las páginas, el clasificador Rocchio devolvió los mejores resultados, especialmente en el lado de la página. Esto es probablemente el resultado del ruido inducido al usar un motor de búsqueda para generar páginas de entrenamiento para la máquina para los clasificadores SVM y de logreza. Es un área de investigación actual sobre cómo mejorar la clasificación utilizando un conjunto de capacitación ruidoso. Según los resultados de la prueba, decidimos usar el clasificador RocChios tanto en el anuncio como en el lado de la página.5. Los sistemas de publicidad contextual de coincidencia semántica sintáctica procesan el contenido de la página, extraen características y luego busque en el espacio de anuncios para encontrar los mejores anuncios coincidentes. Dada una página P y un conjunto de anuncios a = {a1...Como} estimamos la probabilidad relativa de hacer clic P (Haga clic | P, A) con una puntuación que captura la calidad de la coincidencia entre la página y el anuncio. Para encontrar los mejores anuncios para una página, clasificamos los anuncios en A y seleccionamos los pocos principales para la pantalla. El problema se puede definir formalmente como coincidir cada página en el conjunto de todas las páginas p = {p1 ,...PPC} a uno o más anuncios en el conjunto de anuncios. Cada página se representa como un conjunto de secciones de página Pi = {pi, 1, pi, 2...Pi, M}. Las secciones de la página representan diferentes partes estructurales, como título, metadatos, cuerpo, encabezados, etc. A su vez, cada sección es una bolsa de términos desordenada (palabras clave). Una página está representada por la unión de los términos en cada sección: PI = {PWS1 1, PWS1 2...PWSI M} donde PW representa una palabra de página y el superíndice indica la sección de cada término. Un término puede ser un unigram o una frase extraída por un extractor de frases [12]. Del mismo modo, representamos cada anuncio como un conjunto de secciones a = {a1, a2 ,...Al}, cada sección es un conjunto de términos desordenado: Ai = {AWS1 1, AWS1 2...AWSJ L} donde AW es una palabra publicitaria. Los anuncios en nuestros experimentos tienen 3 secciones: título, cuerpo y frase de oferta. En este trabajo, para producir la puntuación de coincidencia, usamos solo la información textual de AD/Page, dejando la información del usuario y otros datos para el trabajo futuro. A continuación, cada página y término AD se asocian con un peso basado en los valores de TF-IDF. El valor de TF se determina en función de las secciones de anuncios individuales. Hay varias opciones para el valor de las FDI, basadas en diferentes ámbitos. En el lado del anuncio, se ha demostrado en trabajos anteriores que el conjunto de anuncios de una campaña proporciona un buen alcance para la estimación de las FDI que conducen a mejores resultados coincidentes [8]. Sin embargo, en este trabajo por simplicidad no tenemos en cuenta las campañas. Para combinar el impacto de la sección Términos y su puntaje TF-IDF, el peso del término AD/Página se define como: Tweight (KWSI) = Peso (Si) · TF IDF (KW) donde Tweight representa el peso y el peso de la pesa (SI) es el peso asignado a una página o sección de anuncios. Este peso es un parámetro fijo determinado por la experimentación. Cada anuncio y página se clasifica en la taxonomía tópica. Definimos estas dos asignaciones: impuestos (PI) = {PCI1 ,...pciu} impuesto (aj) = {acj1...ACJV} Donde PC y AC son clases de página y AD en consecuencia. Cada tarea está asociada con un peso dado por el clasificador. Los pesos se normalizan a suma a 1: x c∈T ax (xi) Cweight (c) = 1 donde xi es una página o un anuncio, y los pesos (c) es el peso de clase - confianza normalizada asignada por el clasificador. El número de clases puede variar entre diferentes páginas y anuncios. Esto corresponde al número de temas con el que se puede asociar una página/anuncio y casi siempre está en el rango 1-4. Ahora definimos el puntaje de relevancia de una AD AI y Página PI como una combinación convexa de la palabra clave (sintáctica) y puntaje de clasificación (semántica): puntaje (PI, AI) = α · Taxscore (impuestos (PI), impuestos (AI)) +(1 - α) · Palabras clave (PI, AI) El parámetro α determina el peso relativo de la puntuación de taxonomía y el puntaje de palabras clave. Para calcular la puntuación de palabras clave, usamos el modelo de espacio vectorial [1] donde las páginas y los anuncios se representan en el espacio n -dimensional, una dimensión para cada término distinto. La magnitud de cada dimensión está determinada por la fórmula tweight (). La puntuación de palabras clave se define como el coseno del ángulo entre la página y los vectores AD: KeywordScore (PI, Ai) = P i∈ | K |tweight (pwi) · tweight (awi) qp i∈ | k | (tweight (pwi)) 2 qp i∈ | k | (tweight (awi)) 2 donde k es el conjunto de todas las palabras clave. La fórmula asume la independencia entre las palabras en las páginas y los anuncios. Además, ignora el orden y la proximidad de los términos en la puntuación. Experimentamos con el impacto de las frases y la proximidad en la puntuación de palabras clave y no vimos un impacto sustancial de estos dos factores. Ahora pasamos a la definición de los impuestos. Esta función indica la coincidencia tópica entre un anuncio dado y una página. A diferencia de las palabras clave que se tratan como dimensiones independientes, aquí las clases (temas) se organizan en una jerarquía. Uno de los objetivos en el diseño de la función TaxScore es poder generalizar dentro de la taxonomía, que es aceptar anuncios relacionados con temas. La generalización puede ayudar a colocar anuncios en los casos en que no hay anuncio que coincida tanto con la categoría como las palabras clave de la página. El ejemplo en la Figura 2 ilustra esta situación. En este ejemplo, en ausencia de anuncios de esquí, una página sobre el esquí que contiene la palabra atómica podría coincidir con el anuncio de snowboard disponible para la misma marca. En general, nos gustaría que el partido sea más fuerte cuando tanto el AD como la página se clasifican en el mismo nodo Figura 2: dos rutas de generalización y más débiles cuando la distancia entre los nodos en la taxonomía se hace más grande. Hay múltiples formas de especificar la distancia entre dos nodos de taxonomía. Además del requisito anterior, esta función debe prestarse a una búsqueda eficiente del espacio AD. Dada una página, tenemos que encontrar el anuncio en unos pocos milisegundos, ya que esto afecta la presentación a un usuario que espera. Esto se discutirá más a fondo en la siguiente sección. Para capturar tanto los requisitos de generalización como de eficiencia, definimos la función TaxScore de la siguiente manera: TaxScore (PC, AC) = x PC∈P C X AC∈C Idist (LCA (PC, AC), AC) · C de peso (PC) · CWeight (AC -peso (AC) En esta función consideramos cada combinación de clase de página y clase AD. Para cada combinación, multiplicamos el producto de los pesos de clase con la función de distancia inversa entre el ancestro menos común de las dos clases (LCA) y la clase AD. La función de distancia inversa IDIST (C1, C2) toma dos nodos en la misma ruta en la taxonomía de la clase y devuelve un número en el intervalo [0, 1] dependiendo de la distancia de los dos nodos de clase. Devuelve 1 si los dos nodos son iguales y disminuye hacia 0 cuando LCA (PC, AC) o AC es la raíz de la taxonomía. La tasa de disminución determina el peso de la generalización versus los otros términos en la fórmula de puntuación. Para determinar la tasa de disminución, consideramos el impacto en la especificidad de la coincidencia cuando sustituimos una clase con uno de sus antepasados. En general, el impacto depende del tema. Por ejemplo, el pasatiempo de nodo en nuestra taxonomía tiene decenas de niños, cada uno representando un pasatiempo diferente, dos ejemplos navegando y tejiendo. Colocar un anuncio sobre tejer en una página sobre la navegación no tiene mucho sentido. Sin embargo, en el ejemplo de deportes de invierno anteriores, en ausencia de una mejor alternativa, los anuncios de esquí podrían colocarse en páginas de snowboard, ya que podrían promover los mismos lugares, proveedores de equipos, etc. Dicho análisis detallado caso por caso es prohibitivamente costoso debido al tamaño de la taxonomía. Una opción es usar las confidencias de las clases de antepasados según lo dado por el clasificador. Sin embargo, encontramos que estos números no son adecuados para este propósito, ya que la magnitud de las confidencias no necesariamente disminuye al subir el árbol. Otra opción es utilizar los métodos Explore-EXPLOIT basados en el aprendizaje automático de la retroalimentación de clics como se describe en [10]. Sin embargo, por simplicidad, en este trabajo elegimos una heurística simple para determinar el costo de generalización de un niño a un padre. En esta heurística observamos la ampliación del alcance cuando nos movemos de un niño a un padre. Estimamos la ampliación por la densidad de los AD clasificados en los nodos parentales frente al nodo secundario. La densidad se obtiene clasificando un gran conjunto de anuncios en la taxonomía utilizando el clasificador de documento descrito anteriormente. Según esto, deje que NC sea el número de documentos clasificado en el subárbol enraizado en c.Luego definimos: idist (c, p) = nc np donde c representa el nodo secundario y p es el nodo principal. Esta fracción se puede ver como una probabilidad de que un anuncio que pertenece al tema principal sea adecuado para el tema infantil.6. Al buscar el espacio de anuncios en la sección anterior, discutimos la elección de la función de puntuación para estimar la coincidencia entre un anuncio y una página. El sistema ofrece los anuncios de Top-K con la puntuación más alta para la ubicación en la página de los editores. El proceso de cálculo de puntaje y selección de anuncios se debe realizar en tiempo real y, por lo tanto, debe ser muy eficiente. Como las colecciones de anuncios están en el rango de cientos de millones de entradas, existe la necesidad de acceso indexado a los anuncios. Los índices invertidos proporcionan soluciones de latencia escalables y de baja para buscar documentos. Sin embargo, estos se han usado tradicionalmente para buscar en función de las palabras clave. Para poder buscar en los anuncios en una combinación de palabras clave y clases, hemos asignado la coincidencia de clasificación para la coincidencia de términos y adaptado la función de puntuación para que sea adecuada para una evaluación rápida sobre índices invertidos. En esta sección, consignamos la indexación de anuncios y la función de clasificación de nuestro sistema de búsqueda de anuncios prototipo para anuncios y páginas coincidentes. Utilizamos un marco de índice invertido estándar donde hay una lista de publicación para cada término distinto. Los anuncios se analizan en términos y cada término se asocia con un peso basado en la sección en la que aparece. Se suman pesos de distintos eventos de un término en un anuncio, de modo que las listas de publicación contienen una entrada por término/combinación de AD. ¿El siguiente desafío es cómo indexar los anuncios para que la información de la clase se preserve en el índice? Un método simple es crear metaterms únicos para las clases y anotar cada anuncio con un meta-término para cada clase asignada. Sin embargo, este método no permite la generalización, ya que solo se seleccionarán los anuncios que coincidan con una etiqueta exacta de la página. Por lo tanto, anotamos cada anuncio con un meta-término para cada antepasado de la clase asignada. Los pesos de los metaderes se asignan de acuerdo con el valor de la función IDIST () definida en la sección anterior. En el lado de la consulta, dadas las palabras clave y la clase de una página, componemos una consulta de solo palabra clave insertando un término de clase para cada antepasado de las clases asignadas a la página. La función de puntuación se adapta a la puntuación de dos partes para la clase MetaTerms y otra para el término de texto. Durante el cálculo de la puntuación de la clase, para cada ruta de clase usamos solo el meta-término de clase más bajo, ignorando a los demás. Por ejemplo, si un anuncio pertenece a la clase de esquí y está anotado tanto con el esquí como con sus deportes de invierno de los padres, el índice contendrá los metaderios de clase especial para el esquí y los deportes de invierno (y todos sus antepasados) con los pesos segúnEl producto de la confianza del clasificador y la función IDIST. Al combinar con una página clasificada en esquí, la consulta contendrá términos para el esquí de clase y para cada uno de sus antepasados. Sin embargo, al anotar un anuncio clasificado en esquí, usaremos el peso para el meta-trimestre de la clase de esquí. Los anuncios clasificados en el snowboard se calificarán utilizando el peso del meta-trimestre deportivo de invierno. Para hacer este cheque de manera eficiente, mantenemos una lista ordenada de todas las rutas de clase y, en el momento de la puntuación, buscamos en las rutas de abajo hacia arriba para que aparezca un meta-término en el anuncio. El primer meta-término se usa para la puntuación, el resto se ignoran. En tiempo de ejecución, evaluamos la consulta utilizando una variante del algoritmo de la varita [3]. Este es un algoritmo de documento en el tiempo [1] que utiliza un enfoque de rama y unido para obtener movimientos eficientes para los cursores asociados a las listas de publicaciones. Encuentra que el siguiente cursor se mueve en función de un límite superior del puntaje para los documentos en los que se colocan actualmente los cursores. El algoritmo mantiene un montón de los mejores candidatos actuales. Los documentos con un límite superior más pequeño que el puntaje mínimo actual entre los documentos candidatos se pueden eliminar de más consideraciones y, por lo tanto, los cursores pueden saltar sobre ellos. Para encontrar el límite superior para un documento, el algoritmo supone que todos los cursores que son antes de que presionen este documento (es decir, el documento contiene todos los términos representados por los cursores antes o en ese documento). Se ha demostrado que la varita se puede usar con cualquier función que sea monotónica con respecto al número de términos coincidentes en el documento. Nuestra función de puntuación es monotónica ya que la puntuación nunca puede disminuir cuando se encuentran más términos en el documento. En el caso especial cuando agregamos un cursor que representa a un antepasado de un término de clase ya factorizado en el puntaje, el puntaje simplemente no cambia (agregamos 0). Dadas estas propiedades, utilizamos una adaptación del algoritmo de la varita donde cambiamos el cálculo de la función de puntuación y el cálculo de la puntuación de límite superior para reflejar nuestra función de puntuación. El resto del algoritmo permanece sin cambios.7. Evaluación experimental 7.1 Datos y metodología Cuantificamos el efecto de la coincidencia sintáctica semántica utilizando un conjunto de 105 páginas. Este conjunto de páginas fue seleccionado por una muestra aleatoria de un conjunto más grande de alrededor de 20 millones de páginas con publicidad contextual. Los anuncios para cada una de estas páginas se han seleccionado de un grupo más grande de anuncios (decenas de millones) por experimentos anteriores realizados por Yahoo! Cada par de la página ha sido juzgado por tres o más jueces humanos en una escala 1 a 3: 1. Relevante, el anuncio está semánticamente directamente relacionado con el tema principal de la página. Por ejemplo, si la página se trata de la Liga Nacional de Fútbol y el anuncio se trata de boletos para los juegos de la NFL, se calificaría como 1. 2. Algo relevante, el anuncio está relacionado con el tema secundario de la página, o está relacionado con el tema principal de la página de manera general. En el ejemplo de la página de la NFL, un anuncio sobre productos de marca NFL se juzgaría como 2. 3. Irrelevante, el anuncio no está relacionado con la página. Por ejemplo, una mención del jugador de la NFL John Maytag desencadena anuncios de lavadora en una página de la NFL.Páginas 105 palabras por página 868 Juicios 2946 Judg.Acuerdo entre editor 84% ADS únicos 2680 ADS únicos por página 25.5 Página Clasificación Precisión 70% Clasificación de anuncios Precisión 86% Tabla 1: Estadísticas del conjunto de datos Para obtener una puntuación para un par de la página AG, promedimos todos los puntajes y luego redondeados al más cercano a la más cercanaentero. Luego utilizamos estos juicios para evaluar qué tan bien nuestros métodos distinguen las asignaciones de AD positivas y negativas para cada página. Las estadísticas del conjunto de datos de la página se dan en la Tabla 1. Los experimentos originales que combinaban las páginas y los anuncios están relacionado libremente con la asignación basada en la coincidencia y clasificación basada en palabras clave sintácticas, pero utilizaron diferentes taxonomías y técnicas de extracción de palabras clave. Por lo tanto, no pudimos usar la agrupación estándar como método de evaluación ya que no controlamos la forma en que se seleccionaron los pares y no pudimos establecer con precisión el conjunto de anuncios de los cuales se seleccionaron los anuncios colocados. En cambio, en nuestra evaluación para cada página consideramos solo aquellos anuncios para los cuales tenemos un juicio. Cada método diferente se aplicó a este conjunto y los anuncios fueron clasificados por la puntuación. La efectividad relativa de los algoritmos se juzgó comparando qué tan bien los métodos separaron los anuncios con juicio positivo de los ADS con juicio negativo. Presentamos precisión en varios niveles de recuperación dentro de este conjunto. Como el conjunto de anuncios por página es relativamente pequeño, la evaluación informa una precisión que es más alta de lo que sería con un conjunto mayor de anuncios negativos. Sin embargo, estos números aún establecen el rendimiento relativo de los algoritmos y podemos usarlo para evaluar el rendimiento en diferentes umbrales de puntaje. Además de la recuperación de precisión sobre los anuncios juzgados, también presentamos el coeficiente de correlación de rango de Kendalls τ para establecer cuán lejos del orden perfecto están los ordenamientos producidos por nuestros algoritmos de clasificación. Para esta prueba, clasificamos los anuncios juzgados por los puntajes asignados por los jueces y luego comparamos esta orden con la orden asignada por nuestros algoritmos. Finalmente, también examinamos la precisión en la posición 1, 3 y 5. 7.2 Resultados La Figura 3 muestra las curvas de recuperación de precisión para la coincidencia sintáctica (palabras clave solo utilizadas) frente a una coincidencia sintáctica semántica con el valor óptimo de α = 0.8 (juzgado porEl puntaje de 11 puntos [1]). En esta figura, suponemos que los pares de ADPAGE juzgados con 1 o 2 son ejemplos positivos y los 3s son ejemplos negativos. También examinamos contar solo los pares juzgados con 1 como ejemplos positivos y no encontramos un cambio significativo en el rendimiento relativo de los métodos probados. Superpuesto también son resultados utilizando frases en la coincidencia de palabras clave. Vemos que estas características adicionales no cambian el rendimiento relativo del algoritmo. Los gráficos muestran un impacto significativo de la información de la clase, especialmente en el rango medio de los valores de recuperación. En el bajo retiro, parte de la tabla se encuentran las curvas. Esto indica que cuando la coincidencia de palabras clave es realmente fuerte (es decir, cuando el anuncio está casi contenido dentro de la página) la precisión 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recuerda precisión alfa = .9, sin frase alfa = 0,Sin frase alfa = 0, frase alfa = .9, frase Figura 3: Conjunto de datos 2: Precisión versus recuerdo de la coincidencia sintáctica (α = 0) versus coincidencia sintáctica-semántica (α = 0.8) α Kendalls τ α = 0 0.086α = 0.25 0.155 α = 0.50 0.166 α = 0.75 0.158 α = 1 0.136 Tabla 2: Kendalls τ para diferentes valores α de la coincidencia de palabras clave sintácticas es comparable con la de la coincidencia semántica sintáctica. Sin embargo, tenga en cuenta que los dos métodos pueden producir diferentes anuncios y podrían usarse como un complemento a nivel de recuerdo. Los componentes semánticos proporcionan una mayor elevación en precisión en el rango medio de recuperación, donde se logra una mejora del 25% mediante el uso de la información de clase para la colocación de anuncios. Esto significa que cuando hay algo de coincidencia entre el anuncio y la página, la restricción a las clases correctas proporciona un mejor alcance para seleccionar los anuncios. La Tabla 2 muestra los valores de Kendalls τ para diferentes valores de α. Calculamos los valores clasificando todos los anuncios juzgados para cada página y promediando los valores en todas las páginas. Los anuncios con juicio empatado recibieron el rango de la posición media. Los resultados muestran que cuando tenemos en cuenta todos los pares de página AD, el valor óptimo de α es de alrededor de 0.5. Tenga en cuenta que la coincidencia puramente sintáctica (α = 0) es, con mucho, el método más débil. La Figura 4 muestra el efecto del parámetro α en la puntuación. Vemos que en la mayoría de los casos la precisión crece o es plana cuando aumentamos α, excepto en el bajo nivel de recuerdo, donde debido a la pequeña cantidad de puntos de datos hay un poco de fluctuación en los resultados. La Tabla 3 muestra la precisión en las posiciones 1, 3 y 5. Nuevamente, el método puramente sintáctico tiene claramente la puntuación más baja por posiciones individuales y el número total de anuncios colocados correctamente. Los números están cerca debido al pequeño número de anuncios considerados, pero todavía hay algunas tendencias notables. Para la posición 1, el α óptimo está en el rango de 0.25 a 0.75. Para las posiciones 3 y 5, el óptimo está en α = 1. Esto también indica que para aquellos anuncios que tienen una puntuación de palabras clave muy alta, la información semántica es algo menos importante. Si casi todas las palabras en un anuncio aparecen en la página, este anuncio es precisión frente a alfa para diferentes niveles de recuperación (conjunto de datos 2) 0.45 0.55 0.65 0.75 0.85 0.95 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 precisión alfa 80% RECURSO 60% RECORT 40% Recuerde 20% Recuerde Figura 4: Impacto de α en la precisión para diferentes niveles de recuperación α #1 #3 #5 Sum α = 0 80 70 68 218 α = 0.25 89 76 73 238 α = 0.5 89 74 73 236 α = 0.7589 78 73 240 α = 1 86 79 74 239 Tabla 3: Precisión en la posición 1, 3 y 5 Es probable que sea relevante para esta página. Sin embargo, cuando no existe una afinidad tan clara, la información de la clase se convierte en un factor dominante.8. Conclusión La publicidad contextual es el motor económico detrás de una gran cantidad de sitios no transaccionales en la web. Los estudios han demostrado que uno de los principales factores de éxito para los anuncios contextuales es su relevancia para el contenido circundante. Todas las soluciones de coincidencia contextuales comerciales existentes conocidas por nosotros evolucionaron de las soluciones de publicidad de búsqueda por las cuales una consulta de búsqueda se corresponde con la frase de oferta de los anuncios. Una extensión natural de la publicidad de búsqueda es extraer frases de la página y combinarlas con la frase de oferta de los anuncios. Sin embargo, las frases y palabras individuales pueden tener múltiples significados y/o no estar relacionados con el tema general de la página que conduce a anuncios de fallas. En este artículo propusimos una forma novedosa de hacer coincidir los anuncios con las páginas web que dependen de una coincidencia tópica (semántica) como un componente importante de la puntuación de relevancia. El partido semántico se basa en la clasificación de páginas y anuncios en una taxonomía publicitaria comercial de 6000 nodos para determinar su distancia tópica. A medida que la clasificación se basa en el contenido completo de la página, es más robusto que las frases de página individuales. La coincidencia semántica se complementa con una coincidencia sintáctica y la puntuación final es una combinación convexa de los dos subcorres con el peso relativo de cada uno determinado por un parámetro α. Evaluamos el enfoque semántico-sintáctico contra un enfoque sintáctico en un conjunto de páginas con diferentes publicidad contextual. Como se muestra en nuestra evaluación experimental, el valor óptimo del parámetro α depende del objetivo preciso de optimización (precisión en una posición particular, precisión en el recuerdo dado). Sin embargo, en todos los casos, el valor óptimo de α está entre 0.25 y 0.9 que indica un efecto significativo del componente de puntaje semántico. La efectividad de la coincidencia sintáctica depende de la calidad de las páginas utilizadas. En páginas de menor calidad, es más probable que cometamos errores de clasificación que luego afectarán negativamente la coincidencia. Demostramos que es factible construir un clasificador a gran escala que tenga suficiente precisión para esta aplicación. Actualmente estamos examinando cómo emplear algoritmos de aprendizaje automático para aprender el valor óptimo de α en función de una colección de características de las páginas de entrada.9.

        "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",

        "Hence we favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach.",
        "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
        "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
        "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",
        "The taxonomy contains nodes for topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital cameras, say Canon.",

        "In the digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life might be just a few months.",
        "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
        "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",
        "In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered.",
        "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
        "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",
        "We evaluated several classifiers and taxonomies and in this paper we present results using a taxonomy with close to 6000 nodes using a variation of the Rocchios classifier [9].",
        "This classifier gave the best results in both page and ad classification, and ultimately in ad relevance.",

        "OVERVIEW OF CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING Contextual advertising is an interplay of four players: • The publisher is the owner of the web pages on which the advertising is displayed.",
        "The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads.",
        "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
        "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
        "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
        "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
        "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
        "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",
        "The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.",
        "Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
        "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
        "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
        "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
        "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
        "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",
        "The ad-network model aligns the interests of the publishers, advertisers and the network.",
        "In general, clicks bring benefits to both the publisher and the ad network by providing revenue, and to the advertiser by bringing traffic to the target web site.",
        "The revenue of the network, given a page p, can be estimated as: R = X i=1..k P(click|p, ai)price(ai, i) where k is the number of ads displayed on page p and price(ai, i) is the click-price of the current ad ai at position i.",
        "The price in this model depends on the set of ads presented on the page.",
        "Several models have been proposed to determine the price, most of them based on generalizations of second price auctions.",
        "However, for simplicity we ignore the pricing model and concentrate on finding ads that will maximize the first term of the product, that is we search for arg max i P(click|p, ai) Furthermore we assume that the probability of click for a given ad and page is determined by its relevance score with respect to the page, thus ignoring the positional effect of the ad placement on the page.",
        "We assume that this is an orthogonal factor to the relevance component and could be easily incorporated in the model. 3.",
        "RELATED WORK Online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular are emerging areas of research.",
        "The published literature is very sparse.",
        "A study presented in [13] confirms the intuition that ads need to be relevant to the users interest to avoid degrading the users experience and increase the probability of reaction.",
        "A recent work by Ribeiro-Neto et. al. [8] examines a number of strategies to match pages to ads based on extracted keywords.",
        "The ads and pages are represented as vectors in a vector space.",
        "The first five strategies proposed in that work match the pages and the ads based on the cosine of the angle between the ad vector and the page vector.",
        "To find out the important part of the ad, the authors explore using different ad sections (bid phrase, title, body) as a basis for the ad vector.",
        "The winning strategy out of the first five requires the bid phrase to appear on the page and then ranks all such ads by the cosine of the union of all the ad sections and the page vectors.",
        "While both pages and ads are mapped to the same space, there is a discrepancy (impendence mismatch) between the vocabulary used in the ads and in the pages.",
        "Furthermore, since in the vector model the dimensions are determined by the number of unique words, plain cosine similarity will not take into account synonyms.",
        "To solve this problem, Ribeiro-Neto et al expand the page vocabulary with terms from other similar pages weighted based on the overall similarity of the origin page to the matched page, and show improved matching precision.",
        "In a follow-up work [7] the authors propose a method to learn impact of individual features using genetic programming to produce a matching function.",
        "The function is represented as a tree composed of arithmetic operators and the log function as internal nodes, and different numerical features of the query and ad terms as leafs.",
        "The results show that genetic programming finds matching functions that significantly improve the matching compared to the best method (without page side expansion) reported in [8].",
        "Another approach to contextual advertising is to reduce it to the problem of sponsored search advertising by extracting phrases from the page and matching them with the bid phrase of the ads.",
        "In [14] a system for phrase extraction is described that used a variety of features to determine the importance of page phrases for advertising purposes.",
        "The system is trained with pages that have been hand annotated with important phrases.",
        "The learning algorithm takes into account features based on tf-idf, html meta data and query logs to detect the most important phrases.",
        "During evaluation, each page phrase up to length 5 is considered as potential result and evaluated against a trained classifier.",
        "In our work we also experimented with a phrase extractor based on the work reported in [12].",
        "While increasing slightly the precision, it did not change the relative performance of the explored algorithms. 4.",
        "PAGE AND AD CLASSIFICATION 4.1 Taxonomy Choice The semantic match of the pages and the ads is performed by classifying both into a common taxonomy.",
        "The matching process requires that the taxonomy provides sufficient differentiation between the common commercial topics.",
        "For example, classifying all medical related pages into one node will not result into a good classification since both sore foot and flu pages will end up in the same node.",
        "The ads suitable for these two concepts are, however, very different.",
        "To obtain sufficient resolution, we used a taxonomy of around 6000 nodes primarily built for classifying commercial interest queries, rather than pages or ads.",
        "This taxonomy has been commercially built by Yahoo!",
        "US.",
        "We will explain below how we can use the same taxonomy to classify pages and ads as well.",
        "Each node in our source taxonomy is represented as a collection of exemplary bid phrases or queries that correspond to that node concept.",
        "Each node has on average around 100 queries.",
        "The queries placed in the taxonomy are high volume queries and queries of high interest to advertisers, as indicated by an unusually high cost-per-click (CPC) price.",
        "The taxonomy has been populated by human editors using keyword suggestions tools similar to the ones used by ad networks to suggest keywords to advertisers.",
        "After initial seeding with a few queries, using the provided tools a human editor can add several hundreds queries to a given node.",
        "Nevertheless, it has been a significant effort to develop this 6000-nodes taxonomy and it has required several person-years of work.",
        "A similar-in-spirit process for building enterprise taxonomies via queries has been presented in [6].",
        "However, the details and tools are completely different.",
        "Figure 1 provides some statistics about the taxonomy used in this work. 4.2 Classification Method As explained, the semantic phase of the matching relies on ads and pages being topically close.",
        "Thus we need to classify pages into the same taxonomy used to classify ads.",
        "In this section we overview the methods we used to build a page and an ad classifier pair.",
        "The detailed description and evaluation of this process is outside the scope of this paper.",
        "Given the taxonomy of queries (or bid-phrases - we use these terms interchangeably) described in the previous section, we tried three methods to build corresponding page and ad classifiers.",
        "For the first two methods we tried to find exemplary pages and ads for each concept as follows: Number of Categories By Level 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Level NumberofCategories Number of Children per Nodes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 29 31 33 35 52 Number of Children NumberofNodes Queries per Node 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 1 50 80 120 160 200 240 280 320 360 400 440 480 Number Queries (up to 500+) NumberofNodes Figure 1: Taxonomy statistics: categories per level; fanout for non-leaf nodes; and queries per node We generated a page training set by running the queries in the taxonomy over a Web search index and using the top 10 results after some filtering as documents labeled with the querys label.",
        "On the ad side we generated a training set for each class by selecting the ads that have a bid phrase assigned to this class.",
        "Using this training sets we then trained a hierarchical SVM [2] (one against all between every group of siblings) and a log-regression [11] classifier. (The second method differs from the first in the type of secondary filtering used.",
        "This filtering eliminates low content pages, pages deemed unsuitable for advertising, pages that lead to excessive class confusion, etc.)",
        "However, we obtained the best performance by using the third document classifier, based on the information in the source taxonomy queries only.",
        "For each taxonomy node we concatenated all the exemplary queries into a single metadocument.",
        "We then used the meta document as a centroid for a nearest-neighbor classifier based on Rocchios framework [9] with only positive examples and no relevance feedback.",
        "Each centroid is defined as a sum of the tf-idf values of each term, normalized by the number of queries in the class cj = 1 |Cj| X q∈Cj q q where cj is the centroid for class Cj; q iterates over the queries in a particular class.",
        "The classification is based on the cosine of the angle between the document d and the centroid meta-documents: Cmax = arg max Cj ∈C cj cj · d d = arg max Cj ∈C P i∈|F | ci j· di qP i∈|F |(ci j)2 qP i∈|F |(di)2 where F is the set of features.",
        "The score is normalized by the document and class length to produce comparable score.",
        "The terms ci and di represent the weight of the ith feature in the class centroid and the document respectively.",
        "These weights are based on the standard tf-idf formula.",
        "As the score of the max class is normalized with regard to document length, the scores for different documents are comparable.",
        "We conducted tests using professional editors to judge the quality of page and ad class assignments.",
        "The tests showed that for both ads and pages the Rocchio classifier returned the best results, especially on the page side.",
        "This is probably a result of the noise induced by using a search engine to machine generate training pages for the SVM and logregression classifiers.",
        "It is an area of current investigation how to improve the classification using a noisy training set.",
        "Based on the test results we decided to use the Rocchios classifier on both the ad and the page side. 5.",

        "The ads in our experiments have 3 sections: title, body, and bid phrase.",
        "In this work, to produce the match score we use only the ad/page textual information, leaving user information and other data for future work.",

        "To combine the impact of the terms section and its tf-idf score, the ad/page term weight is defined as: tWeight(kwsi ) = weightSection(Si) · tf idf(kw) where tWeight stands for term weight and weightSection(Si) is the weight assigned to a page or ad section.",

        "We then used these judgments to evaluate how well our methods distinguish the positive and the negative ad assignments for each page.",
        "The statistics of the page dataset is given in Table 1.",
        "The original experiments that paired the pages and the ads are loosely related to the syntactic keyword based matching and classification based assignment but used different taxonomies and keyword extraction techniques.",
        "Therefore we could not use standard pooling as an evaluation method since we did not control the way the pairs were selected and could not precisely establish the set of ads from which the placed ads were selected.",
        "Instead, in our evaluation for each page we consider only those ads for which we have judgment.",
        "Each different method was applied to this set and the ads were ranked by the score.",

        "In addition to the precision-recall over the judged ads, we also present Kendalls τ rank correlation coefficient to establish how far from the perfect ordering are the orderings produced by our ranking algorithms.",
        "For this test we ranked the judged ads by the scores assigned by the judges and then compared this order to the order assigned by our algorithms.",
        "Finally we also examined the precision at position 1, 3 and 5. 7.2 Results Figure 3 shows the precision recall curves for the syntactic matching (keywords only used) vs. a syntactic-semantic matching with the optimal value of α = 0.8 (judged by the 11-point score [1]).",
        "In this figure, we assume that the adpage pairs judged with 1 or 2 are positive examples and the 3s are negative examples.",

        "Note however that the two methods might produce different ads and could be used as a complement at level of recall.",
        "The semantic components provides largest lift in precision at the mid range of recall where 25% improvement is achieved by using the class information for ad placement.",
        "This means that when there is somewhat of a match between the ad and the page, the restriction to the right classes provides a better scope for selecting the ads.",
        "Table 2 shows the Kendalls τ values for different values of α.",
        "We calculated the values by ranking all the judged ads for each page and averaging the values over all the pages.",
        "The ads with tied judgment were given the rank of the middle position.",
        "The results show that when we take into account all the ad-page pairs, the optimal value of α is around 0.5.",
        "Note that purely syntactic match (α = 0) is by far the weakest method.",
        "Figure 4 shows the effect of the parameter α in the scoring.",
        "We see that in most cases precision grows or is flat when we increase α, except at the low level of recall where due to small number of data points there is a bit of jitter in the results.",
        "Table 3 shows the precision at positions 1, 3 and 5.",
        "Again, the purely syntactic method has clearly the lowest score by individual positions and the total number of correctly placed ads.",
        "The numbers are close due to the small number of the ads considered, but there are still some noticeable trends.",
        "For position 1 the optimal α is in the range of 0.25 to 0.75.",
        "For positions 3 and 5 the optimum is at α = 1.",
        "This also indicates that for those ads that have a very high keyword score, the semantic information is somewhat less important.",

        "CONCLUSION Contextual advertising is the economic engine behind a large number of non-transactional sites on the Web.",
        "Studies have shown that one of the main success factors for contextual ads is their relevance to the surrounding content.",
        "All existing commercial contextual match solutions known to us evolved from search advertising solutions whereby a search query is matched to the bid phrase of the ads.",
        "A natural extension of search advertising is to extract phrases from the page and match them to the bid phrase of the ads.",
        "However, individual phrases and words might have multiple meanings and/or be unrelated to the overall topic of the page leading to miss-matched ads.",
        "In this paper we proposed a novel way of matching advertisements to web pages that rely on a topical (semantic) match as a major component of the relevance score.",
        "The semantic match relies on the classification of pages and ads into a 6000 nodes commercial advertising taxonomy to determine their topical distance.",
        "As the classification relies on the full content of the page, it is more robust than individual page phrases.",
        "The semantic match is complemented with a syntactic match and the final score is a convex combination of the two sub-scores with the relative weight of each determined by a parameter α.",
        "We evaluated the semantic-syntactic approach against a syntactic approach over a set of pages with different contextual advertising.",
        "As shown in our experimental evaluation, the optimal value of the parameter α depends on the precise objective of optimization (precision at particular position, precision at given recall).",
        "However in all cases the optimal value of α is between 0.25 and 0.9 indicating significant effect of the semantic score component.",
        "The effectiveness of the syntactic match depends on the quality of the pages used.",
        "In lower quality pages we are more likely to make classification errors that will then negatively impact the matching.",
        "We demonstrated that it is feasible to build a large scale classifier that has sufficient good precision for this application.",
        "We are currently examining how to employ machine learning algorithms to learn the optimal value of α based on a collection of features of the input pages. 9.",

                "In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience.",
                "With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed.",
                "Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach.",
                "However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads.",

                "However, today, almost all of the for-profit non-transactional web sites (that is, sites that do not sell anything directly) rely at least in part on revenue from context match.",
                "CM supports sites that range from individual bloggers and small niche communities to large publishers such as major newspapers.",
                "Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller!",
                "The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (pay-per-click or PPC).",
                "There are also other models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or similar transaction.",
                "For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper.",
                "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",
                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",
                "Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details).",
                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",
                "Another example could be a page describing the Chevy Tahoe truck (a popular vehicle in US) triggering an ad about Lake Tahoe vacations.",
                "Polysemy is not the only culprit: there is a (maybe apocryphal) story about a lurid news item about a headless body found in a suitcase triggering an ad for Samsonite luggage!",
                "In all these examples the mismatch arises from the fact that the ads are not appropriate for the context.",
                "In order to solve this problem we propose a matching mechanism that combines a semantic phase with the traditional keyword matching, that is, a syntactic phase.",
                "The semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula.",
                "Hence we favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach.",
                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",
                "The taxonomy contains nodes for topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital cameras, say Canon.",
                "The keywords capture the specificity to a level that is more dynamic and granular.",
                "In the digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life might be just a few months.",
                "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",
                "In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered.",
                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",
                "We evaluated several classifiers and taxonomies and in this paper we present results using a taxonomy with close to 6000 nodes using a variation of the Rocchios classifier [9].",

                "The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads.",
                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "<br>contextual advertising</br> usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and <br>contextual advertising</br> in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",
                "The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.",
                "Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
                "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
                "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",
                "The ad-network model aligns the interests of the publishers, advertisers and the network.",
                "In general, clicks bring benefits to both the publisher and the ad network by providing revenue, and to the advertiser by bringing traffic to the target web site.",
                "The revenue of the network, given a page p, can be estimated as: R = X i=1..k P(click|p, ai)price(ai, i) where k is the number of ads displayed on page p and price(ai, i) is the click-price of the current ad ai at position i.",
                "The price in this model depends on the set of ads presented on the page.",
                "Several models have been proposed to determine the price, most of them based on generalizations of second price auctions.",
                "However, for simplicity we ignore the pricing model and concentrate on finding ads that will maximize the first term of the product, that is we search for arg max i P(click|p, ai) Furthermore we assume that the probability of click for a given ad and page is determined by its relevance score with respect to the page, thus ignoring the positional effect of the ad placement on the page.",

                "Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller!",

                "There are also other models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or similar transaction.",
                "For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper.",
                "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",
                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",
                "Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details).",
                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",
                "Another example could be a page describing the Chevy Tahoe truck (a popular vehicle in US) triggering an ad about Lake Tahoe vacations.",
                "Polysemy is not the only culprit: there is a (maybe apocryphal) story about a lurid news item about a headless body found in a suitcase triggering an ad for Samsonite luggage!",
                "In all these examples the mismatch arises from the fact that the ads are not appropriate for the context.",
                "In order to solve this problem we propose a matching mechanism that combines a semantic phase with the traditional keyword matching, that is, a syntactic phase.",
                "The semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula.",
                "Hence we favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach.",
                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",
                "The taxonomy contains nodes for topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital cameras, say Canon.",
                "The keywords capture the specificity to a level that is more dynamic and granular.",
                "In the digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life might be just a few months.",
                "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",
                "In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered.",
                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",
                "We evaluated several classifiers and taxonomies and in this paper we present results using a taxonomy with close to 6000 nodes using a variation of the Rocchios classifier [9].",

                "For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper.",
                "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",
                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",
                "Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details).",
                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",

                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",

                "The keywords capture the specificity to a level that is more dynamic and granular.",

                "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",

                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",

                "The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads.",
                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",
                "The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.",
                "Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
                "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
                "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",

                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",

                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",

                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",

                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",

                "However this method does not allow for generalization, since only the ads matching an exact label of the page would be selected.",

                "In the special case when we add a cursor representing an ancestor of a class term already factored in the score, the score simply does not change (we add 0).",

                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",

                "The semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula.",
                "Hence we favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach.",
                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",

                "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",

                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",

                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",

                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
                "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
                "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",

                "Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller!",
                "The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (pay-per-click or PPC).",
                "There are also other models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or similar transaction.",
                "For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper.",
                "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",
                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",
                "Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details).",
                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",

                "In order to solve this problem we propose a matching mechanism that combines a semantic phase with the traditional keyword matching, that is, a syntactic phase.",
                "The semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula.",

                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",
                "The taxonomy contains nodes for topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital cameras, say Canon.",
                "The keywords capture the specificity to a level that is more dynamic and granular.",
                "In the digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life might be just a few months.",
                "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",
                "In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered.",
                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",

                "The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads.",
                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",
                "The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.",
                "Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
                "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
                "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",

                "Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller!",
                "The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (pay-per-click or PPC).",
                "There are also other models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or similar transaction.",
                "For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper.",
                "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",
                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",
                "Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details).",
                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",

                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",

                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",
                "In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered.",
                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",

                "The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads.",
                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",
                "The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.",
                "Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
                "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
                "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",
                "The ad-network model aligns the interests of the publishers, advertisers and the network.",

                "Research, 2821 Mission College Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95054 {broder, marcusf, vanjaj, riedell}@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT Contextual advertising or Context Match (CM) refers to the placement of commercial textual advertisements within the content of a generic web page, while Sponsored Search (SS) advertising consists in placing ads on result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience.",
                "With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed.",
                "Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach.",
                "However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads.",
                "To overcome this problem, we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic features.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Selection process General Terms: Algorithms, Measurement, Performance, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Web advertising supports a large swath of todays Internet ecosystem.",
                "The total internet advertiser spend in US alone in 2006 is estimated at over 17 billion dollars with a growth rate of almost 20% year over year.",
                "A large part of this market consists of textual ads, that is, short text messages usually marked as sponsored links or similar.",
                "The main advertising channels used to distribute textual ads are: 1.",
                "Sponsored Search or Paid Search advertising which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "All major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) support such ads and act simultaneously as a search engine and an ad agency. 2.",
                "Contextual advertising or Context Match which refers to the placement of commercial ads within the content of a generic web page.",
                "In contextual advertising usually there is a commercial intermediary, called an ad-network, in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between publisher and ad-network) and improving user experience.",
                "Again, all major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) provide such ad-networking services but there are also many smaller players.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. (See [5] for a brief history).",
                "However, today, almost all of the for-profit non-transactional web sites (that is, sites that do not sell anything directly) rely at least in part on revenue from context match.",
                "CM supports sites that range from individual bloggers and small niche communities to large publishers such as major newspapers.",
                "Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller!",
                "The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (pay-per-click or PPC).",
                "There are also other models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or similar transaction.",
                "For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper.",
                "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",
                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",
                "Previous published approaches estimated the <br>ad relevance</br> based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details).",
                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",
                "Another example could be a page describing the Chevy Tahoe truck (a popular vehicle in US) triggering an ad about Lake Tahoe vacations.",
                "Polysemy is not the only culprit: there is a (maybe apocryphal) story about a lurid news item about a headless body found in a suitcase triggering an ad for Samsonite luggage!",
                "In all these examples the mismatch arises from the fact that the ads are not appropriate for the context.",
                "In order to solve this problem we propose a matching mechanism that combines a semantic phase with the traditional keyword matching, that is, a syntactic phase.",
                "The semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula.",
                "Hence we favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach.",
                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",
                "The taxonomy contains nodes for topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital cameras, say Canon.",
                "The keywords capture the specificity to a level that is more dynamic and granular.",
                "In the digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life might be just a few months.",
                "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",
                "In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered.",
                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",
                "We evaluated several classifiers and taxonomies and in this paper we present results using a taxonomy with close to 6000 nodes using a variation of the Rocchios classifier [9].",
                "This classifier gave the best results in both page and ad classification, and ultimately in <br>ad relevance</br>.",
                "The paper proceeds as follows.",
                "In the next section we review the basic principles of the contextual advertising.",
                "Section 3 overviews the related work.",
                "Section 4 describes the taxonomy and document classifier that were used for page and ad classification.",
                "Section 5 describes the semanticsyntactic method.",
                "In Section 6 we briefly discuss how to search efficiently the ad space in order to return the top-k ranked ads.",
                "Experimental evaluation is presented in Section 7.",
                "Finally, Section 8 presents the concluding remarks. 2.",
                "OVERVIEW OF CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING Contextual advertising is an interplay of four players: • The publisher is the owner of the web pages on which the advertising is displayed.",
                "The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads.",
                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",
                "The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.",
                "Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
                "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
                "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",
                "The ad-network model aligns the interests of the publishers, advertisers and the network.",
                "In general, clicks bring benefits to both the publisher and the ad network by providing revenue, and to the advertiser by bringing traffic to the target web site.",
                "The revenue of the network, given a page p, can be estimated as: R = X i=1..k P(click|p, ai)price(ai, i) where k is the number of ads displayed on page p and price(ai, i) is the click-price of the current ad ai at position i.",
                "The price in this model depends on the set of ads presented on the page.",
                "Several models have been proposed to determine the price, most of them based on generalizations of second price auctions.",
                "However, for simplicity we ignore the pricing model and concentrate on finding ads that will maximize the first term of the product, that is we search for arg max i P(click|p, ai) Furthermore we assume that the probability of click for a given ad and page is determined by its relevance score with respect to the page, thus ignoring the positional effect of the ad placement on the page.",
                "We assume that this is an orthogonal factor to the relevance component and could be easily incorporated in the model. 3.",
                "RELATED WORK Online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular are emerging areas of research.",
                "The published literature is very sparse.",
                "A study presented in [13] confirms the intuition that ads need to be relevant to the users interest to avoid degrading the users experience and increase the probability of reaction.",
                "A recent work by Ribeiro-Neto et. al. [8] examines a number of strategies to match pages to ads based on extracted keywords.",
                "The ads and pages are represented as vectors in a vector space.",
                "The first five strategies proposed in that work match the pages and the ads based on the cosine of the angle between the ad vector and the page vector.",
                "To find out the important part of the ad, the authors explore using different ad sections (bid phrase, title, body) as a basis for the ad vector.",
                "The winning strategy out of the first five requires the bid phrase to appear on the page and then ranks all such ads by the cosine of the union of all the ad sections and the page vectors.",
                "While both pages and ads are mapped to the same space, there is a discrepancy (impendence mismatch) between the vocabulary used in the ads and in the pages.",
                "Furthermore, since in the vector model the dimensions are determined by the number of unique words, plain cosine similarity will not take into account synonyms.",
                "To solve this problem, Ribeiro-Neto et al expand the page vocabulary with terms from other similar pages weighted based on the overall similarity of the origin page to the matched page, and show improved matching precision.",
                "In a follow-up work [7] the authors propose a method to learn impact of individual features using genetic programming to produce a matching function.",
                "The function is represented as a tree composed of arithmetic operators and the log function as internal nodes, and different numerical features of the query and ad terms as leafs.",
                "The results show that genetic programming finds matching functions that significantly improve the matching compared to the best method (without page side expansion) reported in [8].",
                "Another approach to contextual advertising is to reduce it to the problem of sponsored search advertising by extracting phrases from the page and matching them with the bid phrase of the ads.",
                "In [14] a system for phrase extraction is described that used a variety of features to determine the importance of page phrases for advertising purposes.",
                "The system is trained with pages that have been hand annotated with important phrases.",
                "The learning algorithm takes into account features based on tf-idf, html meta data and query logs to detect the most important phrases.",
                "During evaluation, each page phrase up to length 5 is considered as potential result and evaluated against a trained classifier.",
                "In our work we also experimented with a phrase extractor based on the work reported in [12].",
                "While increasing slightly the precision, it did not change the relative performance of the explored algorithms. 4.",
                "PAGE AND AD CLASSIFICATION 4.1 Taxonomy Choice The semantic match of the pages and the ads is performed by classifying both into a common taxonomy.",
                "The matching process requires that the taxonomy provides sufficient differentiation between the common commercial topics.",
                "For example, classifying all medical related pages into one node will not result into a good classification since both sore foot and flu pages will end up in the same node.",
                "The ads suitable for these two concepts are, however, very different.",
                "To obtain sufficient resolution, we used a taxonomy of around 6000 nodes primarily built for classifying commercial interest queries, rather than pages or ads.",
                "This taxonomy has been commercially built by Yahoo!",
                "US.",
                "We will explain below how we can use the same taxonomy to classify pages and ads as well.",
                "Each node in our source taxonomy is represented as a collection of exemplary bid phrases or queries that correspond to that node concept.",
                "Each node has on average around 100 queries.",
                "The queries placed in the taxonomy are high volume queries and queries of high interest to advertisers, as indicated by an unusually high cost-per-click (CPC) price.",
                "The taxonomy has been populated by human editors using keyword suggestions tools similar to the ones used by ad networks to suggest keywords to advertisers.",
                "After initial seeding with a few queries, using the provided tools a human editor can add several hundreds queries to a given node.",
                "Nevertheless, it has been a significant effort to develop this 6000-nodes taxonomy and it has required several person-years of work.",
                "A similar-in-spirit process for building enterprise taxonomies via queries has been presented in [6].",
                "However, the details and tools are completely different.",
                "Figure 1 provides some statistics about the taxonomy used in this work. 4.2 Classification Method As explained, the semantic phase of the matching relies on ads and pages being topically close.",
                "Thus we need to classify pages into the same taxonomy used to classify ads.",
                "In this section we overview the methods we used to build a page and an ad classifier pair.",
                "The detailed description and evaluation of this process is outside the scope of this paper.",
                "Given the taxonomy of queries (or bid-phrases - we use these terms interchangeably) described in the previous section, we tried three methods to build corresponding page and ad classifiers.",
                "For the first two methods we tried to find exemplary pages and ads for each concept as follows: Number of Categories By Level 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Level NumberofCategories Number of Children per Nodes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 29 31 33 35 52 Number of Children NumberofNodes Queries per Node 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 1 50 80 120 160 200 240 280 320 360 400 440 480 Number Queries (up to 500+) NumberofNodes Figure 1: Taxonomy statistics: categories per level; fanout for non-leaf nodes; and queries per node We generated a page training set by running the queries in the taxonomy over a Web search index and using the top 10 results after some filtering as documents labeled with the querys label.",
                "On the ad side we generated a training set for each class by selecting the ads that have a bid phrase assigned to this class.",
                "Using this training sets we then trained a hierarchical SVM [2] (one against all between every group of siblings) and a log-regression [11] classifier. (The second method differs from the first in the type of secondary filtering used.",
                "This filtering eliminates low content pages, pages deemed unsuitable for advertising, pages that lead to excessive class confusion, etc.)",
                "However, we obtained the best performance by using the third document classifier, based on the information in the source taxonomy queries only.",
                "For each taxonomy node we concatenated all the exemplary queries into a single metadocument.",
                "We then used the meta document as a centroid for a nearest-neighbor classifier based on Rocchios framework [9] with only positive examples and no relevance feedback.",
                "Each centroid is defined as a sum of the tf-idf values of each term, normalized by the number of queries in the class cj = 1 |Cj| X q∈Cj q q where cj is the centroid for class Cj; q iterates over the queries in a particular class.",
                "The classification is based on the cosine of the angle between the document d and the centroid meta-documents: Cmax = arg max Cj ∈C cj cj · d d = arg max Cj ∈C P i∈|F | ci j· di qP i∈|F |(ci j)2 qP i∈|F |(di)2 where F is the set of features.",

                "As the score of the max class is normalized with regard to document length, the scores for different documents are comparable.",
                "We conducted tests using professional editors to judge the quality of page and ad class assignments.",
                "The tests showed that for both ads and pages the Rocchio classifier returned the best results, especially on the page side.",

                "In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience.",
                "With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed.",
                "Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach.",
                "However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads.",
                "To overcome this problem, we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic features.",

                "The total internet advertiser spend in US alone in 2006 is estimated at over 17 billion dollars with a growth rate of almost 20% year over year.",
                "A large part of this market consists of textual ads, that is, short text messages usually marked as sponsored links or similar.",
                "The main advertising channels used to distribute textual ads are: 1.",
                "Sponsored Search or Paid Search advertising which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "All major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) support such ads and act simultaneously as a search engine and an ad agency. 2.",
                "Contextual advertising or Context Match which refers to the placement of commercial ads within the content of a generic web page.",
                "In contextual advertising usually there is a commercial intermediary, called an ad-network, in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between publisher and ad-network) and improving user experience.",
                "Again, all major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) provide such ad-networking services but there are also many smaller players.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. (See [5] for a brief history).",
                "However, today, almost all of the for-profit non-transactional web sites (that is, sites that do not sell anything directly) rely at least in part on revenue from context match.",
                "CM supports sites that range from individual bloggers and small niche communities to large publishers such as major newspapers.",
                "Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller!",
                "The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (pay-per-click or PPC).",
                "There are also other models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or similar transaction.",
                "For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper.",
                "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",
                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",
                "Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details).",
                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",
                "Another example could be a page describing the Chevy Tahoe truck (a popular vehicle in US) triggering an ad about Lake Tahoe vacations.",
                "Polysemy is not the only culprit: there is a (maybe apocryphal) story about a lurid news item about a headless body found in a suitcase triggering an ad for Samsonite luggage!",
                "In all these examples the mismatch arises from the fact that the ads are not appropriate for the context.",
                "In order to solve this problem we propose a matching mechanism that combines a semantic phase with the traditional keyword matching, that is, a syntactic phase.",
                "The semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula.",
                "Hence we favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach.",
                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",
                "The taxonomy contains nodes for topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital cameras, say Canon.",
                "The keywords capture the specificity to a level that is more dynamic and granular.",
                "In the digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life might be just a few months.",
                "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",
                "In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered.",
                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",
                "We evaluated several classifiers and taxonomies and in this paper we present results using a taxonomy with close to 6000 nodes using a variation of the Rocchios classifier [9].",
                "This classifier gave the best results in both page and ad classification, and ultimately in ad relevance.",
                "The paper proceeds as follows.",

                "In Section 6 we briefly discuss how to search efficiently the ad space in order to return the top-k ranked ads.",
                "Experimental evaluation is presented in Section 7.",
                "Finally, Section 8 presents the concluding remarks. 2.",
                "OVERVIEW OF CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING Contextual advertising is an interplay of four players: • The publisher is the owner of the web pages on which the advertising is displayed.",
                "The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads.",
                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",
                "The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.",
                "Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
                "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
                "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",
                "The ad-network model aligns the interests of the publishers, advertisers and the network.",
                "In general, clicks bring benefits to both the publisher and the ad network by providing revenue, and to the advertiser by bringing traffic to the target web site.",
                "The revenue of the network, given a page p, can be estimated as: R = X i=1..k P(click|p, ai)price(ai, i) where k is the number of ads displayed on page p and price(ai, i) is the click-price of the current ad ai at position i.",
                "The price in this model depends on the set of ads presented on the page.",
                "Several models have been proposed to determine the price, most of them based on generalizations of second price auctions.",
                "However, for simplicity we ignore the pricing model and concentrate on finding ads that will maximize the first term of the product, that is we search for arg max i P(click|p, ai) Furthermore we assume that the probability of click for a given ad and page is determined by its relevance score with respect to the page, thus ignoring the positional effect of the ad placement on the page.",
                "We assume that this is an orthogonal factor to the relevance component and could be easily incorporated in the model. 3.",
                "RELATED WORK Online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular are emerging areas of research.",
                "The published literature is very sparse.",
                "A study presented in [13] confirms the intuition that ads need to be relevant to the users interest to avoid degrading the users experience and increase the probability of reaction.",
                "A recent work by Ribeiro-Neto et. al. [8] examines a number of strategies to match pages to ads based on extracted keywords.",
                "The ads and pages are represented as vectors in a vector space.",
                "The first five strategies proposed in that work match the pages and the ads based on the cosine of the angle between the ad vector and the page vector.",
                "To find out the important part of the ad, the authors explore using different ad sections (bid phrase, title, body) as a basis for the ad vector.",
                "The winning strategy out of the first five requires the bid phrase to appear on the page and then ranks all such ads by the cosine of the union of all the ad sections and the page vectors.",
                "While both pages and ads are mapped to the same space, there is a discrepancy (impendence mismatch) between the vocabulary used in the ads and in the pages.",
                "Furthermore, since in the vector model the dimensions are determined by the number of unique words, plain cosine similarity will not take into account synonyms.",
                "To solve this problem, Ribeiro-Neto et al expand the page vocabulary with terms from other similar pages weighted based on the overall similarity of the origin page to the matched page, and show improved matching precision.",
                "In a follow-up work [7] the authors propose a method to learn impact of individual features using genetic programming to produce a matching function.",
                "The function is represented as a tree composed of arithmetic operators and the log function as internal nodes, and different numerical features of the query and ad terms as leafs.",
                "The results show that genetic programming finds matching functions that significantly improve the matching compared to the best method (without page side expansion) reported in [8].",
                "Another approach to contextual advertising is to reduce it to the problem of sponsored search advertising by extracting phrases from the page and matching them with the bid phrase of the ads.",
                "In [14] a system for phrase extraction is described that used a variety of features to determine the importance of page phrases for advertising purposes.",
                "The system is trained with pages that have been hand annotated with important phrases.",
                "The learning algorithm takes into account features based on tf-idf, html meta data and query logs to detect the most important phrases.",
                "During evaluation, each page phrase up to length 5 is considered as potential result and evaluated against a trained classifier.",
                "In our work we also experimented with a phrase extractor based on the work reported in [12].",
                "While increasing slightly the precision, it did not change the relative performance of the explored algorithms. 4.",
                "PAGE AND AD CLASSIFICATION 4.1 Taxonomy Choice The semantic match of the pages and the ads is performed by classifying both into a common taxonomy.",
                "The matching process requires that the taxonomy provides sufficient differentiation between the common commercial topics.",
                "For example, classifying all medical related pages into one node will not result into a good classification since both sore foot and flu pages will end up in the same node.",
                "The ads suitable for these two concepts are, however, very different.",
                "To obtain sufficient resolution, we used a taxonomy of around 6000 nodes primarily built for classifying commercial interest queries, rather than pages or ads.",
                "This taxonomy has been commercially built by Yahoo!",
                "US.",
                "We will explain below how we can use the same taxonomy to classify pages and ads as well.",
                "Each node in our source taxonomy is represented as a collection of exemplary bid phrases or queries that correspond to that node concept.",
                "Each node has on average around 100 queries.",
                "The queries placed in the taxonomy are high volume queries and queries of high interest to advertisers, as indicated by an unusually high cost-per-click (CPC) price.",
                "The taxonomy has been populated by human editors using keyword suggestions tools similar to the ones used by ad networks to suggest keywords to advertisers.",
                "After initial seeding with a few queries, using the provided tools a human editor can add several hundreds queries to a given node.",
                "Nevertheless, it has been a significant effort to develop this 6000-nodes taxonomy and it has required several person-years of work.",
                "A similar-in-spirit process for building enterprise taxonomies via queries has been presented in [6].",

                "Given the taxonomy of queries (or bid-phrases - we use these terms interchangeably) described in the previous section, we tried three methods to build corresponding page and ad classifiers.",
                "For the first two methods we tried to find exemplary pages and ads for each concept as follows: Number of Categories By Level 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Level NumberofCategories Number of Children per Nodes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 29 31 33 35 52 Number of Children NumberofNodes Queries per Node 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 1 50 80 120 160 200 240 280 320 360 400 440 480 Number Queries (up to 500+) NumberofNodes Figure 1: Taxonomy statistics: categories per level; fanout for non-leaf nodes; and queries per node We generated a page training set by running the queries in the taxonomy over a Web search index and using the top 10 results after some filtering as documents labeled with the querys label.",
                "On the ad side we generated a training set for each class by selecting the ads that have a bid phrase assigned to this class.",
                "Using this training sets we then trained a hierarchical SVM [2] (one against all between every group of siblings) and a log-regression [11] classifier. (The second method differs from the first in the type of secondary filtering used.",
                "This filtering eliminates low content pages, pages deemed unsuitable for advertising, pages that lead to excessive class confusion, etc.)",

                "In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience.",
                "With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed.",
                "Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach.",
                "However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads.",
                "To overcome this problem, we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic features.",

                "The total internet advertiser spend in US alone in 2006 is estimated at over 17 billion dollars with a growth rate of almost 20% year over year.",
                "A large part of this market consists of textual ads, that is, short text messages usually marked as sponsored links or similar.",
                "The main advertising channels used to distribute textual ads are: 1.",
                "Sponsored Search or Paid Search advertising which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "All major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) support such ads and act simultaneously as a search engine and an ad agency. 2.",
                "Contextual advertising or Context Match which refers to the placement of commercial ads within the content of a generic web page.",
                "In contextual advertising usually there is a commercial intermediary, called an ad-network, in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between publisher and ad-network) and improving user experience.",
                "Again, all major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) provide such ad-networking services but there are also many smaller players.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. (See [5] for a brief history).",
                "However, today, almost all of the for-profit non-transactional web sites (that is, sites that do not sell anything directly) rely at least in part on revenue from context match.",
                "CM supports sites that range from individual bloggers and small niche communities to large publishers such as major newspapers.",
                "Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller!",
                "The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (pay-per-click or PPC).",
                "There are also other models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or similar transaction.",
                "For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper.",
                "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",
                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",
                "Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details).",
                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",
                "Another example could be a page describing the Chevy Tahoe truck (a popular vehicle in US) triggering an ad about Lake Tahoe vacations.",
                "Polysemy is not the only culprit: there is a (maybe apocryphal) story about a lurid news item about a headless body found in a suitcase triggering an ad for Samsonite luggage!",
                "In all these examples the mismatch arises from the fact that the ads are not appropriate for the context.",
                "In order to solve this problem we propose a matching mechanism that combines a semantic phase with the traditional keyword matching, that is, a syntactic phase.",
                "The semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula.",
                "Hence we favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach.",
                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",
                "The taxonomy contains nodes for topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital cameras, say Canon.",
                "The keywords capture the specificity to a level that is more dynamic and granular.",
                "In the digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life might be just a few months.",
                "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",
                "In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered.",
                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",
                "We evaluated several classifiers and taxonomies and in this paper we present results using a taxonomy with close to 6000 nodes using a variation of the Rocchios classifier [9].",
                "This classifier gave the best results in both page and ad classification, and ultimately in ad relevance.",
                "The paper proceeds as follows.",

                "Experimental evaluation is presented in Section 7.",
                "Finally, Section 8 presents the concluding remarks. 2.",
                "OVERVIEW OF CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING Contextual advertising is an interplay of four players: • The publisher is the owner of the web pages on which the advertising is displayed.",
                "The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads.",
                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",
                "The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.",
                "Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
                "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
                "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",
                "The ad-network model aligns the interests of the publishers, advertisers and the network.",
                "In general, clicks bring benefits to both the publisher and the ad network by providing revenue, and to the advertiser by bringing traffic to the target web site.",
                "The revenue of the network, given a page p, can be estimated as: R = X i=1..k P(click|p, ai)price(ai, i) where k is the number of ads displayed on page p and price(ai, i) is the click-price of the current ad ai at position i.",
                "The price in this model depends on the set of ads presented on the page.",
                "Several models have been proposed to determine the price, most of them based on generalizations of second price auctions.",
                "However, for simplicity we ignore the pricing model and concentrate on finding ads that will maximize the first term of the product, that is we search for arg max i P(click|p, ai) Furthermore we assume that the probability of click for a given ad and page is determined by its relevance score with respect to the page, thus ignoring the positional effect of the ad placement on the page.",
                "We assume that this is an orthogonal factor to the relevance component and could be easily incorporated in the model. 3.",
                "RELATED WORK Online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular are emerging areas of research.",
                "The published literature is very sparse.",
                "A study presented in [13] confirms the intuition that ads need to be relevant to the users interest to avoid degrading the users experience and increase the probability of reaction.",
                "A recent work by Ribeiro-Neto et. al. [8] examines a number of strategies to match pages to ads based on extracted keywords.",
                "The ads and pages are represented as vectors in a vector space.",
                "The first five strategies proposed in that work match the pages and the ads based on the cosine of the angle between the ad vector and the page vector.",
                "To find out the important part of the ad, the authors explore using different ad sections (bid phrase, title, body) as a basis for the ad vector.",
                "The winning strategy out of the first five requires the bid phrase to appear on the page and then ranks all such ads by the cosine of the union of all the ad sections and the page vectors.",
                "While both pages and ads are mapped to the same space, there is a discrepancy (impendence mismatch) between the vocabulary used in the ads and in the pages.",
                "Furthermore, since in the vector model the dimensions are determined by the number of unique words, plain cosine similarity will not take into account synonyms.",
                "To solve this problem, Ribeiro-Neto et al expand the page vocabulary with terms from other similar pages weighted based on the overall similarity of the origin page to the matched page, and show improved matching precision.",
                "In a follow-up work [7] the authors propose a method to learn impact of individual features using genetic programming to produce a matching function.",
                "The function is represented as a tree composed of arithmetic operators and the log function as internal nodes, and different numerical features of the query and ad terms as leafs.",
                "The results show that genetic programming finds matching functions that significantly improve the matching compared to the best method (without page side expansion) reported in [8].",
                "Another approach to contextual advertising is to reduce it to the problem of sponsored search advertising by extracting phrases from the page and matching them with the bid phrase of the ads.",
                "In [14] a system for phrase extraction is described that used a variety of features to determine the importance of page phrases for advertising purposes.",
                "The system is trained with pages that have been hand annotated with important phrases.",
                "The learning algorithm takes into account features based on tf-idf, html meta data and query logs to detect the most important phrases.",
                "During evaluation, each page phrase up to length 5 is considered as potential result and evaluated against a trained classifier.",
                "In our work we also experimented with a phrase extractor based on the work reported in [12].",
                "While increasing slightly the precision, it did not change the relative performance of the explored algorithms. 4.",
                "PAGE AND AD CLASSIFICATION 4.1 Taxonomy Choice The semantic match of the pages and the ads is performed by classifying both into a common taxonomy.",
                "The matching process requires that the taxonomy provides sufficient differentiation between the common commercial topics.",
                "For example, classifying all medical related pages into one node will not result into a good classification since both sore foot and flu pages will end up in the same node.",
                "The ads suitable for these two concepts are, however, very different.",
                "To obtain sufficient resolution, we used a taxonomy of around 6000 nodes primarily built for classifying commercial interest queries, rather than pages or ads.",
                "This taxonomy has been commercially built by Yahoo!",
                "US.",
                "We will explain below how we can use the same taxonomy to classify pages and ads as well.",
                "Each node in our source taxonomy is represented as a collection of exemplary bid phrases or queries that correspond to that node concept.",
                "Each node has on average around 100 queries.",
                "The queries placed in the taxonomy are high volume queries and queries of high interest to advertisers, as indicated by an unusually high cost-per-click (CPC) price.",
                "The taxonomy has been populated by human editors using keyword suggestions tools similar to the ones used by ad networks to suggest keywords to advertisers.",
                "After initial seeding with a few queries, using the provided tools a human editor can add several hundreds queries to a given node.",
                "Nevertheless, it has been a significant effort to develop this 6000-nodes taxonomy and it has required several person-years of work.",
                "A similar-in-spirit process for building enterprise taxonomies via queries has been presented in [6].",

                "Given the taxonomy of queries (or bid-phrases - we use these terms interchangeably) described in the previous section, we tried three methods to build corresponding page and ad classifiers.",
                "For the first two methods we tried to find exemplary pages and ads for each concept as follows: Number of Categories By Level 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Level NumberofCategories Number of Children per Nodes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 29 31 33 35 52 Number of Children NumberofNodes Queries per Node 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 1 50 80 120 160 200 240 280 320 360 400 440 480 Number Queries (up to 500+) NumberofNodes Figure 1: Taxonomy statistics: categories per level; fanout for non-leaf nodes; and queries per node We generated a page training set by running the queries in the taxonomy over a Web search index and using the top 10 results after some filtering as documents labeled with the querys label.",
                "On the ad side we generated a training set for each class by selecting the ads that have a bid phrase assigned to this class.",
                "Using this training sets we then trained a hierarchical SVM [2] (one against all between every group of siblings) and a log-regression [11] classifier. (The second method differs from the first in the type of secondary filtering used.",
                "This filtering eliminates low content pages, pages deemed unsuitable for advertising, pages that lead to excessive class confusion, etc.)",

                "In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience.",
                "With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed.",
                "Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach.",
                "However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads.",
                "To overcome this problem, we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic features.",

                "A large part of this market consists of textual ads, that is, short text messages usually marked as sponsored links or similar.",

                "Sponsored Search or Paid Search advertising which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "All major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) support such ads and act simultaneously as a search engine and an ad agency. 2.",
                "Contextual advertising or Context Match which refers to the placement of commercial ads within the content of a generic web page.",
                "In contextual advertising usually there is a commercial intermediary, called an ad-network, in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between publisher and ad-network) and improving user experience.",
                "Again, all major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) provide such ad-networking services but there are also many smaller players.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. (See [5] for a brief history).",
                "However, today, almost all of the for-profit non-transactional web sites (that is, sites that do not sell anything directly) rely at least in part on revenue from context match.",
                "CM supports sites that range from individual bloggers and small niche communities to large publishers such as major newspapers.",
                "Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller!",
                "The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (pay-per-click or PPC).",
                "There are also other models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or similar transaction.",
                "For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper.",
                "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",
                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",
                "Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details).",
                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",
                "Another example could be a page describing the Chevy Tahoe truck (a popular vehicle in US) triggering an ad about Lake Tahoe vacations.",
                "Polysemy is not the only culprit: there is a (maybe apocryphal) story about a lurid news item about a headless body found in a suitcase triggering an ad for Samsonite luggage!",
                "In all these examples the mismatch arises from the fact that the ads are not appropriate for the context.",
                "In order to solve this problem we propose a matching mechanism that combines a semantic phase with the traditional keyword matching, that is, a syntactic phase.",
                "The semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula.",
                "Hence we favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach.",
                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",
                "The taxonomy contains nodes for topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital cameras, say Canon.",
                "The keywords capture the specificity to a level that is more dynamic and granular.",
                "In the digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life might be just a few months.",
                "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",
                "In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered.",
                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",
                "We evaluated several classifiers and taxonomies and in this paper we present results using a taxonomy with close to 6000 nodes using a variation of the Rocchios classifier [9].",
                "This classifier gave the best results in both page and ad classification, and ultimately in ad relevance.",

                "Experimental evaluation is presented in Section 7.",
                "Finally, Section 8 presents the concluding remarks. 2.",
                "OVERVIEW OF CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING Contextual advertising is an interplay of four players: • The publisher is the owner of the web pages on which the advertising is displayed.",
                "The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads.",
                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",
                "The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.",
                "Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
                "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
                "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",
                "The ad-network model aligns the interests of the publishers, advertisers and the network.",
                "In general, clicks bring benefits to both the publisher and the ad network by providing revenue, and to the advertiser by bringing traffic to the target web site.",
                "The revenue of the network, given a page p, can be estimated as: R = X i=1..k P(click|p, ai)price(ai, i) where k is the number of ads displayed on page p and price(ai, i) is the click-price of the current ad ai at position i.",
                "The price in this model depends on the set of ads presented on the page.",
                "Several models have been proposed to determine the price, most of them based on generalizations of second price auctions.",
                "However, for simplicity we ignore the pricing model and concentrate on finding ads that will maximize the first term of the product, that is we search for arg max i P(click|p, ai) Furthermore we assume that the probability of click for a given ad and page is determined by its relevance score with respect to the page, thus ignoring the positional effect of the ad placement on the page.",
                "We assume that this is an orthogonal factor to the relevance component and could be easily incorporated in the model. 3.",
                "RELATED WORK Online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular are emerging areas of research.",
                "The published literature is very sparse.",
                "A study presented in [13] confirms the intuition that ads need to be relevant to the users interest to avoid degrading the users experience and increase the probability of reaction.",
                "A recent work by Ribeiro-Neto et. al. [8] examines a number of strategies to match pages to ads based on extracted keywords.",
                "The ads and pages are represented as vectors in a vector space.",
                "The first five strategies proposed in that work match the pages and the ads based on the cosine of the angle between the ad vector and the page vector.",
                "To find out the important part of the ad, the authors explore using different ad sections (bid phrase, title, body) as a basis for the ad vector.",
                "The winning strategy out of the first five requires the bid phrase to appear on the page and then ranks all such ads by the cosine of the union of all the ad sections and the page vectors.",
                "While both pages and ads are mapped to the same space, there is a discrepancy (impendence mismatch) between the vocabulary used in the ads and in the pages.",
                "Furthermore, since in the vector model the dimensions are determined by the number of unique words, plain cosine similarity will not take into account synonyms.",
                "To solve this problem, Ribeiro-Neto et al expand the page vocabulary with terms from other similar pages weighted based on the overall similarity of the origin page to the matched page, and show improved matching precision.",
                "In a follow-up work [7] the authors propose a method to learn impact of individual features using genetic programming to produce a matching function.",
                "The function is represented as a tree composed of arithmetic operators and the log function as internal nodes, and different numerical features of the query and ad terms as leafs.",
                "The results show that genetic programming finds matching functions that significantly improve the matching compared to the best method (without page side expansion) reported in [8].",
                "Another approach to contextual advertising is to reduce it to the problem of sponsored search advertising by extracting phrases from the page and matching them with the bid phrase of the ads.",
                "In [14] a system for phrase extraction is described that used a variety of features to determine the importance of page phrases for advertising purposes.",
                "The system is trained with pages that have been hand annotated with important phrases.",
                "The learning algorithm takes into account features based on tf-idf, html meta data and query logs to detect the most important phrases.",
                "During evaluation, each page phrase up to length 5 is considered as potential result and evaluated against a trained classifier.",
                "In our work we also experimented with a phrase extractor based on the work reported in [12].",
                "While increasing slightly the precision, it did not change the relative performance of the explored algorithms. 4.",
                "PAGE AND AD CLASSIFICATION 4.1 Taxonomy Choice The semantic match of the pages and the ads is performed by classifying both into a common taxonomy.",
                "The matching process requires that the taxonomy provides sufficient differentiation between the common commercial topics.",
                "For example, classifying all medical related pages into one node will not result into a good classification since both sore foot and flu pages will end up in the same node.",
                "The ads suitable for these two concepts are, however, very different.",
                "To obtain sufficient resolution, we used a taxonomy of around 6000 nodes primarily built for classifying commercial interest queries, rather than pages or ads.",
                "This taxonomy has been commercially built by Yahoo!",
                "US.",
                "We will explain below how we can use the same taxonomy to classify pages and ads as well.",
                "Each node in our source taxonomy is represented as a collection of exemplary bid phrases or queries that correspond to that node concept.",
                "Each node has on average around 100 queries.",
                "The queries placed in the taxonomy are high volume queries and queries of high interest to advertisers, as indicated by an unusually high cost-per-click (CPC) price.",
                "The taxonomy has been populated by human editors using keyword suggestions tools similar to the ones used by ad networks to suggest keywords to advertisers.",
                "After initial seeding with a few queries, using the provided tools a human editor can add several hundreds queries to a given node.",
                "Nevertheless, it has been a significant effort to develop this 6000-nodes taxonomy and it has required several person-years of work.",
                "A similar-in-spirit process for building enterprise taxonomies via queries has been presented in [6].",
                "However, the details and tools are completely different.",
                "Figure 1 provides some statistics about the taxonomy used in this work. 4.2 Classification Method As explained, the semantic phase of the matching relies on ads and pages being topically close.",
                "Thus we need to classify pages into the same taxonomy used to classify ads.",
                "In this section we overview the methods we used to build a page and an ad classifier pair.",

                "Given the taxonomy of queries (or bid-phrases - we use these terms interchangeably) described in the previous section, we tried three methods to build corresponding page and ad classifiers.",
                "For the first two methods we tried to find exemplary pages and ads for each concept as follows: Number of Categories By Level 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Level NumberofCategories Number of Children per Nodes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 29 31 33 35 52 Number of Children NumberofNodes Queries per Node 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 1 50 80 120 160 200 240 280 320 360 400 440 480 Number Queries (up to 500+) NumberofNodes Figure 1: Taxonomy statistics: categories per level; fanout for non-leaf nodes; and queries per node We generated a page training set by running the queries in the taxonomy over a Web search index and using the top 10 results after some filtering as documents labeled with the querys label.",
                "On the ad side we generated a training set for each class by selecting the ads that have a bid phrase assigned to this class.",
                "Using this training sets we then trained a hierarchical SVM [2] (one against all between every group of siblings) and a log-regression [11] classifier. (The second method differs from the first in the type of secondary filtering used.",
                "This filtering eliminates low content pages, pages deemed unsuitable for advertising, pages that lead to excessive class confusion, etc.)",
                "However, we obtained the best performance by using the third document classifier, based on the information in the source taxonomy queries only.",
                "For each taxonomy node we concatenated all the exemplary queries into a single metadocument.",
                "We then used the meta document as a centroid for a nearest-neighbor classifier based on Rocchios framework [9] with only positive examples and no relevance feedback.",

                "In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience.",
                "With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed.",
                "Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach.",
                "However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads.",
                "To overcome this problem, we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic features.",

                "The total internet advertiser spend in US alone in 2006 is estimated at over 17 billion dollars with a growth rate of almost 20% year over year.",
                "A large part of this market consists of textual ads, that is, short text messages usually marked as sponsored links or similar.",
                "The main advertising channels used to distribute textual ads are: 1.",
                "Sponsored Search or Paid Search advertising which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "All major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) support such ads and act simultaneously as a search engine and an ad agency. 2.",
                "Contextual advertising or Context Match which refers to the placement of commercial ads within the content of a generic web page.",
                "In contextual advertising usually there is a commercial intermediary, called an ad-network, in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between publisher and ad-network) and improving user experience.",
                "Again, all major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) provide such ad-networking services but there are also many smaller players.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. (See [5] for a brief history).",
                "However, today, almost all of the for-profit non-transactional web sites (that is, sites that do not sell anything directly) rely at least in part on revenue from context match.",
                "CM supports sites that range from individual bloggers and small niche communities to large publishers such as major newspapers.",
                "Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller!",
                "The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (pay-per-click or PPC).",
                "There are also other models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or similar transaction.",
                "For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper.",
                "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",
                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",
                "Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details).",
                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",
                "Another example could be a page describing the Chevy Tahoe truck (a popular vehicle in US) triggering an ad about Lake Tahoe vacations.",
                "Polysemy is not the only culprit: there is a (maybe apocryphal) story about a lurid news item about a headless body found in a suitcase triggering an ad for Samsonite luggage!",
                "In all these examples the mismatch arises from the fact that the ads are not appropriate for the context.",
                "In order to solve this problem we propose a matching mechanism that combines a semantic phase with the traditional keyword matching, that is, a syntactic phase.",
                "The semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula.",
                "Hence we favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach.",
                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",
                "The taxonomy contains nodes for topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital cameras, say Canon.",
                "The keywords capture the specificity to a level that is more dynamic and granular.",
                "In the digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life might be just a few months.",
                "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",
                "In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered.",
                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).",
                "We evaluated several classifiers and taxonomies and in this paper we present results using a taxonomy with close to 6000 nodes using a variation of the Rocchios classifier [9].",
                "This classifier gave the best results in both page and ad classification, and ultimately in ad relevance.",
                "The paper proceeds as follows.",
                "In the next section we review the basic principles of the contextual advertising.",

                "In Section 6 we briefly discuss how to search efficiently the ad space in order to return the top-k ranked ads.",
                "Experimental evaluation is presented in Section 7.",
                "Finally, Section 8 presents the concluding remarks. 2.",
                "OVERVIEW OF CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING Contextual advertising is an interplay of four players: • The publisher is the owner of the web pages on which the advertising is displayed.",
                "The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads.",
                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",
                "The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.",
                "Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
                "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
                "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",
                "The ad-network model aligns the interests of the publishers, advertisers and the network.",
                "In general, clicks bring benefits to both the publisher and the ad network by providing revenue, and to the advertiser by bringing traffic to the target web site.",
                "The revenue of the network, given a page p, can be estimated as: R = X i=1..k P(click|p, ai)price(ai, i) where k is the number of ads displayed on page p and price(ai, i) is the click-price of the current ad ai at position i.",
                "The price in this model depends on the set of ads presented on the page.",
                "Several models have been proposed to determine the price, most of them based on generalizations of second price auctions.",
                "However, for simplicity we ignore the pricing model and concentrate on finding ads that will maximize the first term of the product, that is we search for arg max i P(click|p, ai) Furthermore we assume that the probability of click for a given ad and page is determined by its relevance score with respect to the page, thus ignoring the positional effect of the ad placement on the page.",
                "We assume that this is an orthogonal factor to the relevance component and could be easily incorporated in the model. 3.",
                "RELATED WORK Online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular are emerging areas of research.",
                "The published literature is very sparse.",
                "A study presented in [13] confirms the intuition that ads need to be relevant to the users interest to avoid degrading the users experience and increase the probability of reaction.",
                "A recent work by Ribeiro-Neto et. al. [8] examines a number of strategies to match pages to ads based on extracted keywords.",
                "The ads and pages are represented as vectors in a vector space.",
                "The first five strategies proposed in that work match the pages and the ads based on the cosine of the angle between the ad vector and the page vector.",
                "To find out the important part of the ad, the authors explore using different ad sections (bid phrase, title, body) as a basis for the ad vector.",
                "The winning strategy out of the first five requires the bid phrase to appear on the page and then ranks all such ads by the cosine of the union of all the ad sections and the page vectors.",
                "While both pages and ads are mapped to the same space, there is a discrepancy (impendence mismatch) between the vocabulary used in the ads and in the pages.",
                "Furthermore, since in the vector model the dimensions are determined by the number of unique words, plain cosine similarity will not take into account synonyms.",
                "To solve this problem, Ribeiro-Neto et al expand the page vocabulary with terms from other similar pages weighted based on the overall similarity of the origin page to the matched page, and show improved matching precision.",
                "In a follow-up work [7] the authors propose a method to learn impact of individual features using genetic programming to produce a matching function.",
                "The function is represented as a tree composed of arithmetic operators and the log function as internal nodes, and different numerical features of the query and ad terms as leafs.",
                "The results show that genetic programming finds matching functions that significantly improve the matching compared to the best method (without page side expansion) reported in [8].",
                "Another approach to contextual advertising is to reduce it to the problem of sponsored search advertising by extracting phrases from the page and matching them with the bid phrase of the ads.",
                "In [14] a system for phrase extraction is described that used a variety of features to determine the importance of page phrases for advertising purposes.",
                "The system is trained with pages that have been hand annotated with important phrases.",
                "The learning algorithm takes into account features based on tf-idf, html meta data and query logs to detect the most important phrases.",
                "During evaluation, each page phrase up to length 5 is considered as potential result and evaluated against a trained classifier.",
                "In our work we also experimented with a phrase extractor based on the work reported in [12].",
                "While increasing slightly the precision, it did not change the relative performance of the explored algorithms. 4.",
                "PAGE AND AD CLASSIFICATION 4.1 Taxonomy Choice The semantic match of the pages and the ads is performed by classifying both into a common taxonomy.",
                "The matching process requires that the taxonomy provides sufficient differentiation between the common commercial topics.",
                "For example, classifying all medical related pages into one node will not result into a good classification since both sore foot and flu pages will end up in the same node.",
                "The ads suitable for these two concepts are, however, very different.",
                "To obtain sufficient resolution, we used a taxonomy of around 6000 nodes primarily built for classifying commercial interest queries, rather than pages or ads.",
                "This taxonomy has been commercially built by Yahoo!",
                "US.",
                "We will explain below how we can use the same taxonomy to classify pages and ads as well.",
                "Each node in our source taxonomy is represented as a collection of exemplary bid phrases or queries that correspond to that node concept.",
                "Each node has on average around 100 queries.",
                "The queries placed in the taxonomy are high volume queries and queries of high interest to advertisers, as indicated by an unusually high cost-per-click (CPC) price.",
                "The taxonomy has been populated by human editors using keyword suggestions tools similar to the ones used by ad networks to suggest keywords to advertisers.",
                "After initial seeding with a few queries, using the provided tools a human editor can add several hundreds queries to a given node.",
                "Nevertheless, it has been a significant effort to develop this 6000-nodes taxonomy and it has required several person-years of work.",
                "A similar-in-spirit process for building enterprise taxonomies via queries has been presented in [6].",
                "However, the details and tools are completely different.",
                "Figure 1 provides some statistics about the taxonomy used in this work. 4.2 Classification Method As explained, the semantic phase of the matching relies on ads and pages being topically close.",
                "Thus we need to classify pages into the same taxonomy used to classify ads.",
                "In this section we overview the methods we used to build a page and an ad classifier pair.",
                "The detailed description and evaluation of this process is outside the scope of this paper.",
                "Given the taxonomy of queries (or bid-phrases - we use these terms interchangeably) described in the previous section, we tried three methods to build corresponding page and ad classifiers.",
                "For the first two methods we tried to find exemplary pages and ads for each concept as follows: Number of Categories By Level 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Level NumberofCategories Number of Children per Nodes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 29 31 33 35 52 Number of Children NumberofNodes Queries per Node 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 1 50 80 120 160 200 240 280 320 360 400 440 480 Number Queries (up to 500+) NumberofNodes Figure 1: Taxonomy statistics: categories per level; fanout for non-leaf nodes; and queries per node We generated a page training set by running the queries in the taxonomy over a Web search index and using the top 10 results after some filtering as documents labeled with the querys label.",
                "On the ad side we generated a training set for each class by selecting the ads that have a bid phrase assigned to this class.",
                "Using this training sets we then trained a hierarchical SVM [2] (one against all between every group of siblings) and a log-regression [11] classifier. (The second method differs from the first in the type of secondary filtering used.",
                "This filtering eliminates low content pages, pages deemed unsuitable for advertising, pages that lead to excessive class confusion, etc.)",
                "However, we obtained the best performance by using the third document classifier, based on the information in the source taxonomy queries only.",
                "For each taxonomy node we concatenated all the exemplary queries into a single metadocument.",
                "We then used the meta document as a centroid for a nearest-neighbor classifier based on Rocchios framework [9] with only positive examples and no relevance feedback.",
                "Each centroid is defined as a sum of the tf-idf values of each term, normalized by the number of queries in the class cj = 1 |Cj| X q∈Cj q q where cj is the centroid for class Cj; q iterates over the queries in a particular class.",
                "The classification is based on the cosine of the angle between the document d and the centroid meta-documents: Cmax = arg max Cj ∈C cj cj · d d = arg max Cj ∈C P i∈|F | ci j· di qP i∈|F |(ci j)2 qP i∈|F |(di)2 where F is the set of features.",

                "In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience.",
                "With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed.",
                "Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach.",
                "However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads.",
                "To overcome this problem, we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic features.",

                "Again, all major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) provide such ad-networking services but there are also many smaller players.",
                "The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. (See [5] for a brief history).",
                "However, today, almost all of the for-profit non-transactional web sites (that is, sites that do not sell anything directly) rely at least in part on revenue from context <br>match</br>.",
                "CM supports sites that range from individual bloggers and small niche communities to large publishers such as major newspapers.",
                "Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller!",
                "The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (pay-per-click or PPC).",
                "There are also other models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or similar transaction.",
                "For simplicity, we only deal with the PPC model in this paper.",
                "Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a better user experience and thus to increase the probability of clicks.",
                "This intuition is supported by the analogy to conventional publishing where there are very successful magazines (e.g.",
                "Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].",
                "Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for more details).",
                "However targeting mechanisms based solely on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand.",
                "Another example could be a page describing the Chevy Tahoe truck (a popular vehicle in US) triggering an ad about Lake Tahoe vacations.",
                "Polysemy is not the only culprit: there is a (maybe apocryphal) story about a lurid news item about a headless body found in a suitcase triggering an ad for Samsonite luggage!",
                "In all these examples the mismatch arises from the fact that the ads are not appropriate for the context.",
                "In order to solve this problem we propose a matching mechanism that combines a semantic phase with the traditional keyword matching, that is, a syntactic phase.",
                "The semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula.",
                "Hence we favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach.",
                "Furthermore, by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual generalization of the ad search space in the case when there are no ads matching the precise topic of the page.",
                "For example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling of the class curling and both of these classes share the parent winter sports.",
                "In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow down the search to concepts that are of too small granularity to be in the taxonomy.",
                "The taxonomy contains nodes for topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital cameras, say Canon.",
                "The keywords capture the specificity to a level that is more dynamic and granular.",
                "In the digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life might be just a few months.",
                "Updating the taxonomy with new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are dealing with millions of manufacturers.",
                "In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting page has a unified feel and improves the user experience.",
                "In the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those ads will be considered.",
                "Even if there are no ads for this particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the automotive domain.",
                "To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging problem: classify both pages and ads within a large taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough) with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-<br>match</br>).",
                "We evaluated several classifiers and taxonomies and in this paper we present results using a taxonomy with close to 6000 nodes using a variation of the Rocchios classifier [9].",
                "This classifier gave the best results in both page and ad classification, and ultimately in ad relevance.",

                "Experimental evaluation is presented in Section 7.",
                "Finally, Section 8 presents the concluding remarks. 2.",
                "OVERVIEW OF CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING Contextual advertising is an interplay of four players: • The publisher is the owner of the web pages on which the advertising is displayed.",
                "The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience. • The advertiser provides the supply of ads.",
                "Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g. sale of digital cameras during the holiday season).",
                "As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services. • The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.",
                "The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher. • Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.",
                "Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.",
                "One of the advantages of online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.",
                "Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertisers web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).",
                "The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.",
                "Context <br>match</br> advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.",
                "In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.",
                "Thus each ad is annotated with one or more bid phrases.",
                "The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.",
                "However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].",
                "In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.",
                "The ad-network model aligns the interests of the publishers, advertisers and the network.",
                "In general, clicks bring benefits to both the publisher and the ad network by providing revenue, and to the advertiser by bringing traffic to the target web site.",
                "The revenue of the network, given a page p, can be estimated as: R = X i=1..k P(click|p, ai)price(ai, i) where k is the number of ads displayed on page p and price(ai, i) is the click-price of the current ad ai at position i.",
                "The price in this model depends on the set of ads presented on the page.",
                "Several models have been proposed to determine the price, most of them based on generalizations of second price auctions.",
                "However, for simplicity we ignore the pricing model and concentrate on finding ads that will maximize the first term of the product, that is we search for arg max i P(click|p, ai) Furthermore we assume that the probability of click for a given ad and page is determined by its relevance score with respect to the page, thus ignoring the positional effect of the ad placement on the page.",
                "We assume that this is an orthogonal factor to the relevance component and could be easily incorporated in the model. 3.",
                "RELATED WORK Online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular are emerging areas of research.",
                "The published literature is very sparse.",
                "A study presented in [13] confirms the intuition that ads need to be relevant to the users interest to avoid degrading the users experience and increase the probability of reaction.",
                "A recent work by Ribeiro-Neto et. al. [8] examines a number of strategies to <br>match</br> pages to ads based on extracted keywords.",
                "The ads and pages are represented as vectors in a vector space.",
                "The first five strategies proposed in that work <br>match</br> the pages and the ads based on the cosine of the angle between the ad vector and the page vector.",
                "To find out the important part of the ad, the authors explore using different ad sections (bid phrase, title, body) as a basis for the ad vector.",
                "The winning strategy out of the first five requires the bid phrase to appear on the page and then ranks all such ads by the cosine of the union of all the ad sections and the page vectors.",
                "While both pages and ads are mapped to the same space, there is a discrepancy (impendence mismatch) between the vocabulary used in the ads and in the pages.",
                "Furthermore, since in the vector model the dimensions are determined by the number of unique words, plain cosine similarity will not take into account synonyms.",
                "To solve this problem, Ribeiro-Neto et al expand the page vocabulary with terms from other similar pages weighted based on the overall similarity of the origin page to the matched page, and show improved matching precision.",
                "In a follow-up work [7] the authors propose a method to learn impact of individual features using genetic programming to produce a matching function.",
                "The function is represented as a tree composed of arithmetic operators and the log function as internal nodes, and different numerical features of the query and ad terms as leafs.",
                "The results show that genetic programming finds matching functions that significantly improve the matching compared to the best method (without page side expansion) reported in [8].",
                "Another approach to contextual advertising is to reduce it to the problem of sponsored search advertising by extracting phrases from the page and matching them with the bid phrase of the ads.",
                "In [14] a system for phrase extraction is described that used a variety of features to determine the importance of page phrases for advertising purposes.",
                "The system is trained with pages that have been hand annotated with important phrases.",
                "The learning algorithm takes into account features based on tf-idf, html meta data and query logs to detect the most important phrases.",
                "During evaluation, each page phrase up to length 5 is considered as potential result and evaluated against a trained classifier.",
                "In our work we also experimented with a phrase extractor based on the work reported in [12].",
                "While increasing slightly the precision, it did not change the relative performance of the explored algorithms. 4.",
                "PAGE AND AD CLASSIFICATION 4.1 Taxonomy Choice The semantic <br>match</br> of the pages and the ads is performed by classifying both into a common taxonomy.",
                "The matching process requires that the taxonomy provides sufficient differentiation between the common commercial topics.",
                "For example, classifying all medical related pages into one node will not result into a good classification since both sore foot and flu pages will end up in the same node.",
                "The ads suitable for these two concepts are, however, very different.",
                "To obtain sufficient resolution, we used a taxonomy of around 6000 nodes primarily built for classifying commercial interest queries, rather than pages or ads.",
                "This taxonomy has been commercially built by Yahoo!",
                "US.",
                "We will explain below how we can use the same taxonomy to classify pages and ads as well.",
                "Each node in our source taxonomy is represented as a collection of exemplary bid phrases or queries that correspond to that node concept.",
                "Each node has on average around 100 queries.",
                "The queries placed in the taxonomy are high volume queries and queries of high interest to advertisers, as indicated by an unusually high cost-per-click (CPC) price.",
                "The taxonomy has been populated by human editors using keyword suggestions tools similar to the ones used by ad networks to suggest keywords to advertisers.",
                "After initial seeding with a few queries, using the provided tools a human editor can add several hundreds queries to a given node.",
                "Nevertheless, it has been a significant effort to develop this 6000-nodes taxonomy and it has required several person-years of work.",
                "A similar-in-spirit process for building enterprise taxonomies via queries has been presented in [6].",
                "However, the details and tools are completely different.",
                "Figure 1 provides some statistics about the taxonomy used in this work. 4.2 Classification Method As explained, the semantic phase of the matching relies on ads and pages being topically close.",
                "Thus we need to classify pages into the same taxonomy used to classify ads.",
                "In this section we overview the methods we used to build a page and an ad classifier pair.",
                "The detailed description and evaluation of this process is outside the scope of this paper.",
                "Given the taxonomy of queries (or bid-phrases - we use these terms interchangeably) described in the previous section, we tried three methods to build corresponding page and ad classifiers.",
                "For the first two methods we tried to find exemplary pages and ads for each concept as follows: Number of Categories By Level 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Level NumberofCategories Number of Children per Nodes 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 29 31 33 35 52 Number of Children NumberofNodes Queries per Node 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 1 50 80 120 160 200 240 280 320 360 400 440 480 Number Queries (up to 500+) NumberofNodes Figure 1: Taxonomy statistics: categories per level; fanout for non-leaf nodes; and queries per node We generated a page training set by running the queries in the taxonomy over a Web search index and using the top 10 results after some filtering as documents labeled with the querys label.",
                "On the ad side we generated a training set for each class by selecting the ads that have a bid phrase assigned to this class.",
                "Using this training sets we then trained a hierarchical SVM [2] (one against all between every group of siblings) and a log-regression [11] classifier. (The second method differs from the first in the type of secondary filtering used.",
                "This filtering eliminates low content pages, pages deemed unsuitable for advertising, pages that lead to excessive class confusion, etc.)",

                "As the classification relies on the full content of the page, it is more robust than individual page phrases.",
                "The semantic <br>match</br> is complemented with a syntactic <br>match</br> and the final score is a convex combination of the two sub-scores with the relative weight of each determined by a parameter α.",

                "As shown in our experimental evaluation, the optimal value of the parameter α depends on the precise objective of optimization (precision at particular position, precision at given recall).",
                "However in all cases the optimal value of α is between 0.25 and 0.9 indicating significant effect of the semantic score component.",
