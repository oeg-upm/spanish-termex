We present an abstract architecture that enables agents to exchange models of their local learning processes and introduces a number of different methods for integrating these processes. This allows us to apply existing agent interaction mechanisms to distributed machine learning tasks, thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available in agent-based computing, and enables agents to engage in meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions. We apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which different learners may be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning algorithms. We report on experimental results obtained using this system, review related work on the subject, and discuss potential future extensions to the framework.

INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance. Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]). All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem). Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems. In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.). Examples for applications of this kind abound. Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners. In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]). Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance. An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud. Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle. Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance. Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results). Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents. To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3). We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4). Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2. ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process. To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space. This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise. For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}. For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k). For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined). Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework. For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk. In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once. We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt. Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht). We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively. The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H). A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 679 training function ht performance measure solution quality qtgtft training set Dt hypothesis hypothesis ht−1 Figure 1: A generic model of a learning step i.e. the only requirement the transition relation →⊆ L × L makes is that the new hypothesis is the result of training the old hypothesis on all available sample data that belongs to the current step. We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g). The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses. Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process. However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others. For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process. This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively. As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary). Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment). Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below. In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents. For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents. This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment. Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action. In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched). Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment. The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed. More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data). The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has. One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.

Table 1: Matrix of integration functions for messages sent from learner i to j to simply use g(l )(h(l )) as a running performance measure to evaluate how well the agent is performing. This is too abstract and unspecific for our purposes: While it describes what agents should do (transform the settings for the next learning step in an optimal way), it doesnt specify how this can be achieved in practice. 2.2 Integrating learning process information To specify how an agents learning process can be affected by integrating information received from others, we need to flesh out the details of how the learning steps it will perform can be modified using incoming information about learning processes described by other agents (this includes the acquisition of new learning data from the environment as a special case). In the most general case, we can specify this in terms of the potential modifications to the existing information about learning histories that can be performed using new information. For ease of presentation, we will assume that agents are stationary learning processes that can only record the previously executed learning step and only exchange information about this one individual learning step (our model can be easily extended to cater for more complex settings). Let lj = Dj, Hj, fj, gj, hj be the current state of agent j when receiving a learning process description li = Di, Hi, fi, gi, hi from agent i (for the time being, we assume that this is a specific learning step and not a more vague, disjunctive description of properties of the learning step of i). Considering all possible interactions at an abstract level, we basically obtain a matrix of possibilities for modifications of js learning step specification as shown in Table 1. In this matrix, each entry specifies a family of integration functions pc→c 1 , . . . , pc→c kc→c where c, c ∈ {D, H, f, g, h} and which define how agent js component cj will be modified using the information ci provided about (the same or a different component of) is learning step by applying pc→c r (ci, cj) for some r ∈ {1, . . . , kc→c }. To put it more simply, the collections of p-functions an agent j uses specifies how it will modify its own learning behaviour using information obtained from i. For the diagonal of this matrix, which contains the most common ways of integrating new information in ones own learning model, obvious ways of modifying ones own learning process include replacing cj by ci or ignoring ci altogether. More complex/subtle forms of learning process integration include: • Modification of Dj: append Di to Dj; filter out all elements from Dj which also appear in Di; append Di to Dj discarding all elements with attributes outside ranges which affect gj, or those elements already correctly classified by hj; • Modification of Hi: use the union/intersection of Hi and Hj; alternatively, discard elements of Hj that are inconsistent with Dj in the process of intersection or union, or filter out elements that cannot be obtained using fj (unless fj is modified at the same time) • Modification of fj: modify parameters or background knowledge of fj using information about fi; assess their relevance by simulating previous learning steps on Dj using gj and discard those that do not help improve own performance • Modification of hj: combine hj with hi using (say) logical or mathematical operators; make the use of hi contingent on a pre-integration assessment of its quality using own data Dj and gj While this list does not include fully fledged, concrete integration operations for learning processes, it is indicative of the broad range of interactions between individual agents learning processes that our framework enables. Note that the list does not include any modifications to gj. This is because we do not allow modifications to the agents own quality measure as this would render the model of rational (learning) action useless (if the quality measure is relative and volatile, we cannot objectively judge learning performance). Also note that some of the above examples require consulting other elements of lj than those appearing as arguments of the p-operations; we omit these for ease of notation, but emphasise that information-rich operations will involve consulting many different aspects of lj. Apart from operations along the diagonal of the matrix, more exotic integration operations are conceivable that combine information about different components. In theory we could fill most of the matrix with entries for them, but for lack of space we list only a few examples: • Modification of Dj using fi: pre-process samples in fi, e.g. to achieve intermediate representations that fj can be applied to • Modification of Dj using hi: filter out samples from Dj that are covered by hi and build hj using fj only on remaining samples • Modification of Hj using fi: filter out hypotheses from Hj that are not realisable using fi • Modification of hj using gi: if hj is composed of several sub-components, filter out those sub-components that do not perform well according to gi • . . . Finally, many messages received from others describing properties of their learning processes will contain information about several elements of a learning step, giving rise to yet more complex operations that depend on which kinds of information are available.

Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 681 Figure 2: Screenshot of our simulation system, displaying online vessel tracking data for the North Sea region 3. APPLICATION EXAMPLE 3.1 Domain description As an illustration of our framework, we present an agentbased data mining system for clustering-based surveillance using AIS (Automatic Identification System [1]) data. In our application domain, different commercial and governmental agencies track the journeys of ships over time using AIS data which contains structured information automatically provided by ships equipped with shipborne mobile AIS stations to shore stations, other ships and aircrafts. This data contains the ships identity, type, position, course, speed, navigational status and other safety-related information. Figure 2 shows a screenshot of our simulation system. It is the task of AIS agencies to detect anomalous behaviour so as to alarm police/coastguard units to further investigate unusual, potentially suspicious behaviour. Such behaviour might include things such as deviation from the standard routes between the declared origin and destination of the journey, unexpected close encounters between different vessels on sea, or unusual patterns in the choice of destination over multiple journeys, taking the type of vessel and reported freight into account. While the reasons for such unusual behaviour may range from pure coincidence or technical problems to criminal activity (such as smuggling, piracy, terrorist/military attacks) it is obviously useful to pre-process the huge amount of vessel (tracking) data that is available before engaging in further analysis by human experts. To support this automated pre-processing task, software used by these agencies applies clustering methods in order to identify outliers and flag those as potentially suspicious entities to the human user. However, many agencies active in this domain are competing enterprises and use their (partially overlapping, but distinct) datasets and learning hypotheses (models) as assets and hence cannot be expected to collaborate in a fully cooperative way to improve overall learning results. Considering that this is the reality of the domain in the real world, it is easy to see that a framework like the one we have suggested above might be useful to exploit the cooperation potential that is not exploited by current systems. 3.2 Agent-based distributed learning system design To describe a concrete design for the AIS domain, we need to specify the following elements of the overall system: 1. The datasets and clustering algorithms available to individual agents, 2. the interaction mechanism used for exchanging descriptions of learning processes, and 3. the decision mechanism agents apply to make learning decisions. Regarding 1., our agents are equipped with their own private datasets in the form of vessel descriptions. Learning samples are represented by tuples containing data about individual vessels in terms of attributes A = {1, . . . , n} including things such as width, length, etc. with real-valued domains ([Ai] = R for all i). In terms of learning algorithm, we consider clustering with a fixed number of k clusters using the k-means and k-medoids clustering algorithms [5] (fixed meaning that the learning algorithm will always output k clusters; however, we allow agents to change the value of k over different learning cycles). This means that the hypothesis space can be defined as H = { c1, . . . , ck |ci ∈ R|A| } i.e. the set of all possible sets of k cluster centroids in |A|-dimensional Euclidean space. For each hypothesis h = c1, . . . , ck and any data point d ∈ ×n i=1[Ai] given domain [Ai] for the ith attribute of each sample, the assignment to clusters is given by C( c1, . . . , ck , d) = arg min 1≤j≤k |d − cj| i.e. d is assigned to that cluster whose centroid is closest to the data point in terms of Euclidean distance. For evaluation purposes, each dataset pertaining to a particular agent i is initially split into a training set Di and a validation Vi. Then, we generate a set of fake vessels Fi such that |Fi| = |Vi|. These two sets assess the agents ability to detect suspicious vessels. For this, we assign a confidence value r(h, d) to every ship d: r(h, d) = 1 |d − cC(h,d)| where C(h, d) is the index of the nearest centroid. Based on this measure, we classify any vessel in Fi ∪ Vi as fake if its r-value is below the median of all the confidences r(h, d) for d ∈ Fi ∪ Vi. With this, we can compute the quality gi(h) ∈ R as the ratio between all correctly classified vessels and all vessels in Fi ∪ Vi. As concerns 2., we use a simple Contract-Net Protocol (CNP) [20] based hypothesis trading mechanism: Before each learning iteration, agents issue (publicly broadcasted) Calls-For-Proposals (CfPs), advertising their own numerical model quality. In other words, the initiator of a CNP describes its own current learning state as (∗, ∗, ∗, gi(h), ∗) where h is their current hypothesis/model. We assume that agents are sincere when advertising their model quality, but note that this quality might be of limited relevance to other agents as they may specialise on specific regions of the data space not related to the test set of the sender of the CfP. Subsequently, (some) agents may issue bids in which they advertise, in turn, the quality of their own model. If the 682 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) bids (if any) are accepted by the initiator of the protocol who issued the CfP, the agents exchange their hypotheses and the next learning iteration ensues. To describe what is necessary for 3., we have to specify (i) under which conditions agents submit bids in response to a CfP, (ii) when they accept bids in the CNP negotiation process, and (iii) how they integrate the received information in their own learning process. Concerning (i) and (ii), we employ a very simple rule that is identical in both cases: let g be ones own model quality and g that advertised by the CfP (or highest bid, respectively). If g > g we respond to the CfP (accept the bid), else respond to the CfP (accept the bid) with probability P(g /g) and ignore (reject) it else. If two agents make a deal, they exchange their learning hypotheses (models). In our experiments, g and g are calculated by an additional agent that acts as a global validation mechanism for all agents (in a more realistic setting a comparison mechanism for different g functions would have to be provided). As for (iii), each agent uses a single model merging operator taken from the following two classes of operators (hj is the receivers own model and hi is the providers model): • ph→h (hi, hj) : - m-join: The m best clusters (in terms of coverage of Dj) from hypothesis hi are appended to hj. - m-select: The set of the m best clusters (in terms of coverage of Dj) from the union hi ∪hj is chosen as a new model. (Unlike m-join this method does not prefer own clusters over others.) • ph→D (hi, Dj) : - m-filter: The m best clusters (as above) from hi are identified and appended to a new model formed by using those samples not covered by these clusters applying the own learning algorithm fj. Whenever m is large enough to encompass all clusters, we simply write join or filter for them. In section 4 we analyse the performance of each of these two classes for different choices of m. It is noteworthy that this agent-based distributed data mining system is one of the simplest conceivable instances of our abstract architecture. While we have previously applied it also to a more complex market-based architecture using Inductive Logic Programming learners in a transport logistics domain [22], we believe that the system described here is complex enough to illustrate the key design decisions involved in using our framework and provides simple example solutions for these design issues. 4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Figure 3 shows results obtained from simulations with three learning agents in the above system using the k-means and k-medoids clustering methods respectively. We partition the total dataset of 300 ships into three disjoint sets of 100 samples each and assign each of these to one learning agent. The Single Agent is learning from the whole dataset. The parameter k is set to 10 as this is the optimal value for the total dataset according to the Davies-Bouldin index [9]. For m-select we assume m = k which achieves a constant Figure 3: Performance results obtained for different integration operations in homogeneous learner societies using the k-means (top) and k-medoids (bottom) methods model size. For m-join and m-filter we assume m = 3 to limit the extent to which models increase over time. During each experiment the learning agents receive ship descriptions in batches of 10 samples. Between these batches, there is enough time to exchange the models among the agents and recompute the models if necessary. Each ship is described using width, length, draught and speed attributes with the goal of learning to detect which vessels have provided fake descriptions of their own properties. The validation set contains 100 real and 100 randomly generated fake ships. To generate sufficiently realistic properties for fake ships, their individual attribute values are taken from randomly selected ships in the validation set (so that each fake sample is a combination of attribute values of several existing ships). In these experiments, we are mainly interested in investigating whether a simple form of knowledge sharing between self-interested learning agents could improve agent performance compared to a setting of isolated learners. Thereby, we distinguish between homogeneous learner societies where all agents use the same clustering algorithm and heterogeneous ones where different agents use different algorithms. As can be seen from the performance plots in Figure 3 (homogeneous case) and 4 (heterogeneous case, two agents use the same method and one agent uses the other) this is clearly the case for the (unrestricted) join and filter integration operations (m = k) in both cases. This is quite natural, as these operations amount to sharing all available model knowledge among agents (under appropriate constraints depending on how beneficial the exchange seems to the agents). We can see that the quality of these operations is very close to the Single Agent that has access to all training data. For the restricted (m < k) m-join, m-filter and m-select methods we can also observe an interesting distinction, The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 683 Figure 4: Performance results obtained for different integration operations in heterogeneous societies with the majority of learners using the k-means (top) and k-medoids (bottom) methods namely that these perform similarly to the isolated learner case in homogeneous agent groups but better than isolated learners in more heterogeneous societies. This suggests that heterogeneous learners are able to benefit even from rather limited knowledge sharing (and this is what using a rather small m = 3 amounts to given that k = 10) while this is not always true for homogeneous agents. This nicely illustrates how different learning or data mining algorithms can specialise on different parts of the problem space and then integrate their local results to achieve better individual performance. Apart from these obvious performance benefits, integrating partial learning results can also have other advantages: The m-filter operation, for example, decreases the number of learning samples and thus can speed up the learning process. The relative number of filtered examples measured in our experiments is shown in the following table. k-means k-medoids filtering 30-40 % 10-20 % m-filtering 20-30 % 5-15 % The overall conclusion we can draw from these initial experiments with our architecture is that since a very simplistic application of its principles has proven capable of improving the performance of individual learning agents, it is worthwhile investigating more complex forms of information exchange about learning processes among autonomous learners. 5. RELATED WORK We have already mentioned work on distributed (nonagent) machine learning and data mining in the introductory chapter, so in this section we shall restrict ourselves to approaches that are more closely related to our outlook on distributed learning systems. Very often, approaches that are allegedly agent-based completely disregard agent autonomy and prescribe local decision-making procedures a priori. A typical example for this type of system is the one suggested by Caragea et al. [6] which is based on a distributed support-vector machine approach where agents incrementally join their datasets together according to a fixed distributed algorithm. A similar example is the work of Weiss [24], where groups of classifier agents learn to organise their activity so as to optimise global system behaviour. The difference between this kind of collaborative agentbased learning systems [16] and our own framework is that these approaches assume a joint learning goal that is pursued collaboratively by all agents. Many approaches rely heavily on a homogeneity assumption: Plaza and Ontanon [15] suggest methods for agentbased intelligent reuse of cases in case-based reasoning but is only applicable to societies of homogeneous learners (and coined towards a specific learning method). An agentbased method for integrating distributed cluster analysis processes using density estimation is presented by Klusch et al. [13] which is also specifically designed for a particular learning algorithm. The same is true of [22, 23] which both present market-based mechanisms for aggregating the output of multiple learning agents, even though these approaches consider more interesting interaction mechanisms among learners. A number of approaches for sharing learning data [18] have also been proposed: Grecu and Becker [12] suggest an exchange of learning samples among agents, and Ghosh et al. [11] is a step in the right direction in terms of revealing only partial information about ones learning process as it deals with limited information sharing in distributed clustering. Papyrus [3] is a system that provides a markup language for meta-description of data, hypotheses and intermediate results and allows for an exchange of all this information among different nodes, however with a strictly cooperative goal of distributing the load for massively distributed data mining tasks. The MALE system [19] was a very early multiagent learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses. Agents were able to critique each others hypotheses until agreement was reached. However, all agents in this system were identical and the system was strictly cooperative. The ANIMALS system [10] was used to simulate multistrategy learning by combining two or more learning techniques (represented by heterogeneous agents) in order to overcome weaknesses in the individual algorithms, yet it was also a strictly cooperative system. As these examples show and to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to provide a framework that can accommodate both independent and heterogeneous learning agents and this can be regarded as the main contribution of our work. 6. CONCLUSION In this paper, we outlined a generic, abstract framework for distributed machine learning and data mining. This framework constitutes, to our knowledge, the first attempt 684 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) to capture complex forms of interaction between heterogeneous and/or self-interested learners in an architecture that can be used as the foundation for implementing systems that use complex interaction and reasoning mechanisms to enable agents to inform and improve their learning abilities with information provided by other learners in the system, provided that all agents engage in a sufficiently similar learning activity. To illustrate that the abstract principles of our architecture can be turned into concrete, computational systems, we described a market-based distributed clustering system which was evaluated in the domain of vessel tracking for purposes of identifying deviant or suspicious behaviour. Although our experimental results only hint at the potential of using our architecture, they underline that what we are proposing is feasible in principle and can have beneficial effects even in its most simple instantiation. Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free. This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results. Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical). In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes. Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be. These issues, together with a more systematic and thorough investigation of advanced interaction and communication mechanisms for distributed, collaborating and competing agents will be the subject of our future work on the subject.

Presentamos una arquitectura abstracta que permite a los agentes intercambiar modelos de sus procesos de aprendizaje locales e introduce varios métodos diferentes para integrar estos procesos. Esto nos permite aplicar mecanismos de interacción de agentes existentes a tareas de aprendizaje automático distribuido, aprovechando así los poderosos métodos de coordinación disponibles en la informática basada en agentes, y permite a los agentes participar en metaderazos sobre sus propias decisiones de aprendizaje. Aplicamos esta arquitectura a una aplicación de agrupación distribuida en el mundo real para ilustrar cómo el marco conceptual se puede utilizar en sistemas prácticos en los que diferentes alumnos pueden usar diferentes conjuntos de datos, hipótesis y algoritmos de aprendizaje. Reportamos sobre los resultados experimentales obtenidos utilizando este sistema, revisamos el trabajo relacionado sobre el tema y discutimos las posibles extensiones futuras al marco. Términos generales Categorías de teoría y descriptores de sujetos I.2.11 [Inteligencia artificial]: inteligencia artificial distribuida Sistemas-Multiagentes 1. Introducción En las áreas de aprendizaje automático y minería de datos (cf. [14, 17] para descripción general), durante mucho tiempo se ha reconocido que la paralelización y la distribución pueden usarse para mejorar el rendimiento del aprendizaje. Se han sugerido varias técnicas a este respecto, que van desde la integración de bajo nivel de hipótesis de aprendizaje derivadas de forma independiente (por ejemplo, combinando diferentes clasificadores para tomar decisiones de clasificación óptimas [4, 7], promedio de modelos de clasificadores bayesianos [8] o métodos basados en consenso paraIntegrando diferentes agrupaciones [11]), a la combinación de alto nivel de resultados de aprendizaje obtenidos por agentes de aprendizaje heterogéneos que usan meta-aprendizaje (por ejemplo, [3, 10, 21]). Todos estos enfoques asumen la homogeneidad del diseño de agentes (todos los agentes aplican el mismo algoritmo de aprendizaje) y/o objetivos de agentes (todos los agentes están tratando de resolver cooperativamente un solo problema de aprendizaje global). Por lo tanto, las técnicas que sugieren no son aplicables en sociedades de estudiantes autónomos que interactúan en sistemas abiertos. En tales sistemas, los alumnos (agentes) pueden no ser capaces de integrar sus conjuntos de datos o resultados de aprendizaje (debido a diferentes formatos de datos y representaciones, algoritmos de aprendizaje o restricciones legales que prohíben dicha integración [11]) y no siempre se puede garantizar que interactúe enUna moda estrictamente cooperativa (el conocimiento descubierto y los datos recopilados pueden ser activos económicos que solo deben compartirse cuando esto se considera rentable; los agentes maliciosos pueden intentar influir negativamente en los resultados de los demás aprendiendo, etc.). Ejemplos para aplicaciones de este tipo abundan. Muchos dominios de aprendizaje distribuido implican el uso de datos confidenciales y prohíben el intercambio de estos datos (por ejemplo, el intercambio de datos del paciente en el diagnóstico de tumor cerebral distribuido [2]); sin embargo, pueden permitir el intercambio de hipótesis de aprendizaje local entre diferentes alumnos. En otras áreas, los datos de capacitación pueden ser comercialmente valiosos, de modo que los agentes solo lo pongan a disposición de otras si esos agentes pudieran proporcionar algo a cambio (por ejemplo, en la vigilancia y el seguimiento remotos de los barcos, donde las diferentes agencias involucradas son proveedores de servicios comerciales [1]). Además, los agentes pueden tener un interés personal en afectar negativamente el rendimiento de aprendizaje de otros agentes. Un ejemplo para esto es el de los agentes fraudulentos en eBay, que pueden tratar de evitar que los agentes de aprendizaje de la reputación sean de la construcción de modelos útiles para detectar fraude. Ver a los alumnos como agentes autónomos y autodirigidos es la única visión apropiada que uno puede adoptar en el modelado de estos entornos de aprendizaje distribuidos: la metáfora del agente se convierte en una necesidad como opuesta a las preferencias de escalabilidad, selección dinámica de datos, interactividad [13], que también puede serlogrado a través de la distribución (no agente) y la paralelización en principio. A pesar de la autonomía y la autodirección de los agentes de aprendizaje, muchos de estos sistemas exhiben una superposición suficiente en términos de objetivos de aprendizaje individual, por lo que estaba disponible una cooperación beneficiosa si estuviera disponible un modelo para la interacción flexible entre los alumnos autónomos que permitió a los agentes 1. intercambiar 1.Información sobre diferentes aspectos de su propio mecanismo de aprendizaje en diferentes niveles de detalle sin verse obligado a revelar información privada que no debe divulgarse, 2. Decide en qué medida quieran compartir información sobre sus propios procesos de aprendizaje y utilizar la información proporcionada por otros alumnos.y 3. Razón sobre cómo esta información se puede utilizar mejor para mejorar su propio rendimiento de aprendizaje. Nuestro modelo se basa en la simple idea de que los alumnos autónomos deben mantener metadescripciones de sus propios procesos de aprendizaje (ver también [3]) para poder intercambiar información y razonar sobre ellos de manera racional (es decir, con el objetivo generalde mejorar sus propios resultados de aprendizaje). Nuestra hipótesis es muy simple: si podemos idear una visión abstracta suficientemente general de describir los procesos de aprendizaje, podremos utilizar toda la gama de métodos para (i) razonamiento racional y (ii) comunicación y coordinación ofrecida por el agentetecnología para construir agentes de aprendizaje autónomos efectivos. Para probar esta hipótesis, introducimos dicha arquitectura abstracta (Sección 2) e implementamos una instancia simple y concreta de ella en un dominio del mundo real (Sección 3). Reportamos sobre los resultados empíricos obtenidos con este sistema implementado que demuestra la viabilidad de nuestro enfoque (Sección 4). Finalmente, revisamos el trabajo relacionado (Sección 5) y concluyemos con un resumen, discusión de nuestro enfoque y perspectiva para el trabajo futuro sobre el tema (Sección 6).2. Arquitectura abstracta Nuestro marco se basa en proporcionar descripciones formales (de nivel meta) de los procesos de aprendizaje, es decir, representaciones de todos los componentes relevantes de la maquinaria de aprendizaje utilizada por un agente de aprendizaje, junto con información sobre el estado del proceso de aprendizaje. Para garantizar que este marco sea suficientemente general, consideramos la siguiente descripción general de un problema de aprendizaje: dados los datos D ⊆ D tomados de un espacio de instancia D, un espacio de hipótesis H y una función objetivo (desconocida) C ∈ H1, derivan una funciónH ∈ H que se aproxima a C lo mejor posible de acuerdo con alguna medida de rendimiento G: H → Q donde Q es un conjunto de niveles posibles de rendimiento del aprendizaje.1 Al requerir esto, estamos asegurando que el problema de aprendizaje pueda resolverse en principio utilizando el espacio de hipótesis dado. Esta definición muy amplia incluye una serie de componentes de un problema de aprendizaje para el cual se pueden proporcionar especificaciones más concretas si queremos ser más precisos. Para los casos de clasificación y agrupación, por ejemplo, podemos especificar aún más lo anterior de la siguiente manera: los datos de aprendizaje se pueden describir en ambos casos como d = × n i = 1 [ai] donde [ai] es el dominio del atributo ésimo yEl conjunto de atributos es a = {1 ,..., n}. Para el espacio de hipótesis, obtenemos h ⊆ {h | h: d → {0, 1}} en el caso de clasificación (es decir, un subconjunto del conjunto de todos los clasificadores posibles, cuya naturaleza depende de la expresividad del algoritmo de aprendizajeusado) y H ⊆ {H | H: D → N, H es total con el rango {1 ,..., k}} en el caso de la agrupación (es decir, un subconjunto de todos los conjuntos de posibles asignaciones de clúster que mapean puntos de datos a un número finito de grupos numerados 1 a k). Para la clasificación, G podría definirse en términos de los números de falsos negativos y falsos positivos con respecto a algún conjunto de validación V ⊆ D, y la agrupación podría usar varias medidas de validez del clúster para evaluar la calidad de una hipótesis actual, de modo que Q =R en ambos casos (pero se pueden imaginar otros conjuntos de niveles de calidad de aprendizaje). A continuación, presentamos una noción de paso de aprendizaje, que impone una estructura básica uniforme en todos los procesos de aprendizaje que se supone que intercambian información utilizando nuestro marco. Para esto, suponemos que a cada alumno se le presenta un conjunto finito de datos d = D1 ,...DK en cada paso (este es un conjunto ordenado para expresar que el orden en el que las muestras se usan para asuntos de capacitación) y emplea una función de capacitación/actualización F: H × D ∗ → H que actualiza H dada una serie de muestras D1,..., dk. En otras palabras, un paso de aprendizaje siempre consiste en aplicar la función de actualización a todas las muestras en D exactamente una vez. Definimos un paso de aprendizaje como tupla L = D, H, F, G, H donde requerimos que H ⊆ H y H ∈ H. La intuición detrás de esta definición es que cada paso de aprendizaje describe completamente una iteración de aprendizaje como se muestra en la figura1: En el paso T, el alumno actualiza la hipótesis actual HT - 1 con Data DT, y evalúa la nueva hipótesis HT resultante de acuerdo con la medida de rendimiento actual GT. Tal paso de aprendizaje es equivalente a los siguientes pasos de cálculo: 1. Entrena el algoritmo en todas las muestras en D (una vez), es decir, calcule FT (HT - 1, DT) = HT, 2. Calcule la calidad GT de la hipótesis resultanteGT (HT). Denotamos el conjunto de todos los pasos de aprendizaje posibles por L. Para facilitar la notación, denotamos los componentes de cualquier l ∈ L por D (L), H (L), F (L) y G (L), respectivamente. La razón por la cual tales especificaciones de paso de aprendizaje usan un subconjunto H de h en lugar de h en sí mismo es que los alumnos a menudo tienen un conocimiento explícito sobre qué hipótesis se descartan efectivamente por F dada H en el futuro (si este no es el caso, aún podemos establecerH = H). Un proceso de aprendizaje es una secuencia finita y no vacía L = L1 → L2 →...→ ln de pasos de aprendizaje tal que ∀1 ≤ i <n .h (li+1) = f (li) (h (li), d (li)) el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 679 Función de entrenamiento HT Medida de rendimiento Calidad QTGTFT Conjunto de capacitación DT Hipótesis HT-1 Figura 1: Un modelo genérico de un paso de aprendizaje, es decir, el único requisito de la relación de transición → ⊆ L × L ×L hace que la nueva hipótesis es el resultado de capacitar a la antigua hipótesis en todos los datos de muestra disponibles que pertenece al paso actual. Denotamos el conjunto de todos los procesos de aprendizaje posibles por L (ignorando, para facilitar la notación, el hecho de que este conjunto depende de H, D y los espacios de posibles funciones de capacitación y evaluación F y G). La traza de rendimiento asociada con un proceso de aprendizaje L es la secuencia Q1 ,..., qn ∈ Qn donde qi = g (li) (h (li)), es decir, la secuencia de valores de calidad calculados por las medidas de rendimiento de los pasos de aprendizaje individuales en las hipótesis respectivas. Dichas especificaciones permiten a los agentes proporcionar una autodescripción de su proceso de aprendizaje. Sin embargo, en la comunicación entre los agentes de aprendizaje, a menudo es útil proporcionar información parcial sobre el proceso de aprendizaje interno en lugar de sus detalles completos, p.Al anunciar esta información para ingresar negociaciones de intercambio de información con otros. Para este propósito, asumiremos que los alumnos describen su estado interno en términos de conjuntos de procesos de aprendizaje (en el sentido de elección disyuntiva) que llamamos descripciones de procesos de aprendizaje (LPD) en lugar de dar descripciones precisas sobre un solo proceso de aprendizaje concreto. Esto nos permite describir las propiedades de un proceso de aprendizaje sin especificar sus detalles exhaustivamente. Como ejemplo, el conjunto {l ∈ L | ∀l = l [i] .d (l) ≤ 100} describe todos los procesos que tienen un conjunto de entrenamiento de la mayoría de las 100 muestras (donde todos los demás elementos son arbitrarios). Del mismo modo, {l ∈ L | ∀l = l [i] .d (l) = {d}} es equivalente a proporcionar información sobre una sola muestra {d} y ningún otro detalle sobre el proceso (esto puede ser útil paramodelo, por ejemplo, datos recibidos del entorno). Por lo tanto, usamos ℘ (l), es decir, el conjunto de todos los LPD, como base para diseñar lenguajes de contenido para la comunicación en los protocolos que especificamos a continuación. En la práctica, el lenguaje de contenido real elegido, por supuesto, estará más restringido y permitirá solo un tipo especial de subconjuntos de L de forma compacta, y su elección será crucial para las interacciones que pueden ocurrir entre los agentes de aprendizaje. Para nuestros ejemplos a continuación, simplemente asumimos la enumeración explícita de todos los elementos posibles de los espacios de funciones y espacios de funciones respectivos (D, H, etc.) extendidos por el uso de símbolos comodín ∗ (de modo que nuestro segundo ejemplo anterior se convierta ({D}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)).2.1 Agentes de aprendizaje En nuestro marco, un agente de aprendizaje es esencialmente una función de metetrazonamiento que opera en información sobre procesos de aprendizaje y está situado en un entorno co-habitado por otros agentes de aprendizaje. Esto significa que no solo es capaz de controlar meta a nivel sobre cómo aprender, sino que al hacerlo puede tener en cuenta la información que proporciona otros agentes o el medio ambiente. Aunque son posibles casos puramente cooperativos o híbridos, para los fines de este documento supondremos que los agentes son puramente egoístas, y que, si bien puede haber un potencial de cooperación considerando cómo los agentes pueden mejorar mutuamente el rendimiento de aprendizaje de los demás, no hayMecanismo global que puede hacer cumplir dicho comportamiento cooperativo.2 Formalmente hablando, una función de aprendizaje de los agentes es una función que, dada un conjunto de historias de procesos de aprendizaje anteriores (de uno mismo y potencialmente de procesos de aprendizaje sobre los cuales otros agentes han proporcionado información) y produce unaPaso de aprendizaje, que es su próxima acción de aprendizaje. En el sentido más general, la actualización del proceso de aprendizaje interno de nuestros agentes de aprendizaje puede verse como una función λ: ℘ (l) → L × ℘ (l) que toma un conjunto de historias de aprendizaje de uno mismo y de otros como insumos y calcula un nuevoPaso de aprendizaje que se ejecutará mientras se actualiza el conjunto de historiales de procesos de aprendizaje conocidos (por ejemplo, al agregar la nueva acción de aprendizaje al proceso de aprendizaje propio y deja toda la información sobre los procesos de aprendizaje de los demás intactos). Tenga en cuenta que en λ ({l1, ... ln}) = (l, {l1, ... ln}) Algunos elementos li del conjunto de procesos de aprendizaje de entrada pueden ser descripciones de nuevos datos de aprendizaje recibidos del entorno. La función λ puede ser elegida esencialmente por el agente siempre que se cumpla un requisito, a saber, que los datos de aprendizaje que se usan siempre provienen de lo que se ha observado previamente. Más formalmente, ∀ {L1 ,...ln} ∈ ℘ (l) .λ ({l1, ... ln}) = (l, {l1, ... ln}) ⇒ „d (l) ∪ [l = li [j] d (l)«⊆ [l = li [j] d (l), es decir, cualquier λ que salga como un nuevo paso de aprendizaje y un conjunto actualizado de historias de aprendizaje, no puede inventar nuevos datos;Tiene que funcionar con las muestras que se han puesto a disposición antes en el proceso a través del entorno o de otros agentes (y, por supuesto, puede volver a entrenar en los datos utilizados anteriormente). El objetivo del agente es generar un paso de aprendizaje óptimo en cada iteración dada la información que tiene. Una posibilidad de especificar esto es exigir que ∀ {L1 ,...ln} ∈ ℘ (l) .λ ({l1, ... ln}) = (l, {l1, ... ln}) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g (l) (h (l))Pero dado que generalmente no será realista calcular el siguiente paso de aprendizaje óptimo en cada situación, es más útil 2 Tenga en cuenta que nuestra perspectiva no solo es diferente de los modelos comunes y cooperativos de aprendizaje automático distribuido y minería de datos, sino que también delinea nuestro enfoque desdeSistemas de aprendizaje multiagente en los que los agentes aprenden sobre otros agentes [25], es decir, el objetivo de aprendizaje en sí no se ve afectado por el comportamiento de los agentes en el medio ambiente.680 el sexto intl.

Tabla 1: Matriz de funciones de integración para los mensajes enviados desde el alumno I a J para usar simplemente G (L) (H (L)) como una medida de rendimiento en ejecución para evaluar qué tan bien está funcionando el agente. Esto es demasiado abstracto e inespecífico para nuestros propósitos: si bien describe lo que los agentes deben hacer (transformar la configuración para el próximo paso de aprendizaje de una manera óptima), no especifica cómo se puede lograr esto en la práctica.2.2 Integración de la información del proceso de aprendizaje Para especificar cómo un proceso de aprendizaje de los agentes puede verse afectado por la integración de la información recibida de otros, necesitamos desarrollar los detalles de cómo los pasos de aprendizaje que realizará se pueden modificar utilizando información entrante sobre procesos de aprendizaje descritos por otros agentes(Esto incluye la adquisición de nuevos datos de aprendizaje del entorno como un caso especial). En el caso más general, podemos especificar esto en términos de las posibles modificaciones a la información existente sobre los historiales de aprendizaje que se pueden realizar utilizando nueva información. Para facilitar la presentación, asumiremos que los agentes son procesos de aprendizaje estacionarios que solo pueden registrar el paso de aprendizaje ejecutado previamente e solo intercambiar información sobre este paso de aprendizaje individual (nuestro modelo puede extenderse fácilmente para atender a configuraciones más complejas). Sea LJ = DJ, HJ, FJ, GJ, HJ el estado actual del Agente J Al recibir una descripción del proceso de aprendizaje Li = Di, Hi, Fi, Gi, Hi del Agente I (por el momento, suponemos que esto esun paso de aprendizaje específico y no una descripción más vaga y disyuntiva de las propiedades del paso de aprendizaje de I). Teniendo en cuenta todas las interacciones posibles a nivel abstracto, básicamente obtenemos una matriz de posibilidades para las modificaciones de la especificación de paso de aprendizaje JS como se muestra en la Tabla 1. En esta matriz, cada entrada especifica una familia de funciones de integración PC → C 1 ,..., PC → C KC → C donde C, C ∈ {D, H, F, G, H} y que definen cómo el componente de Agente JS CJ se modificará utilizando la información CI proporcionada sobre (el mismo o un componente diferente de)Paso de aprendizaje aplicando PC → C R (CI, CJ) para algunos r ∈ {1 ,..., KC → C}. Para decirlo más en pocas palabras, las colecciones de las funciones P que utiliza un agente j especifica cómo modificará su propio comportamiento de aprendizaje utilizando la información obtenida de i. Para la diagonal de esta matriz, que contiene las formas más comunes de integrar nueva información en el modelo de aprendizaje propio, las formas obvias de modificar el proceso de aprendizaje propio incluyen reemplazar a CJ por CI o ignorar CI por completo. Las formas más complejas/sutiles de integración de procesos de aprendizaje incluyen: • Modificación de DJ: Agregar DI a DJ;Filtrar todos los elementos de DJ que también aparecen en DI;Agregue DI para que DJ descarte todos los elementos con atributos fuera de rangos que afectan a GJ, o esos elementos ya clasificados correctamente por HJ;• Modificación de HI: use la unión/intersección de HI y HJ;Alternativamente, descarte elementos de HJ que son inconsistentes con DJ en el proceso de intersección o unión, o filtren elementos que no pueden obtenerFJ utilizando información sobre FI;Evalúe su relevancia simulando pasos de aprendizaje anteriores en DJ usando GJ y descarte aquellos que no ayudan a mejorar el rendimiento propio • Modificación de HJ: Combine HJ con HI usando (digamos) operadores lógicos o matemáticos;Haga el uso de HI contingente en una evaluación previa a la integración de su calidad utilizando propios datos de datos y GJ Si bien esta lista no incluye operaciones de integración concreta y completamente incrustadas para los procesos de aprendizaje, es indicativo de la amplia gama de interacciones entre los agentes individuales que aprendenprocesos que nuestro marco habilita. Tenga en cuenta que la lista no incluye ninguna modificación a GJ. Esto se debe a que no permitimos modificaciones en la medida de calidad de los agentes, ya que esto haría que el modelo de acción racional (aprendizaje) sea inútil (si la medida de calidad es relativa y volátil, no podemos juzgar objetivamente el rendimiento del aprendizaje). También tenga en cuenta que algunos de los ejemplos anteriores requieren consultar otros elementos de LJ que los que aparecen como argumentos de las operaciones P;Los omitimos para facilitar la notación, pero enfatizamos que las operaciones ricas en información implicarán consultar muchos aspectos diferentes de LJ. Además de las operaciones a lo largo de la diagonal de la matriz, se pueden concebir operaciones de integración más exóticas que combinan información sobre diferentes componentes. En teoría, podríamos llenar la mayoría de la matriz con entradas para ellos, pero por falta de espacio enumeramos solo unos pocos ejemplos: • Modificación de DJ usando FI: muestras de preproceso en FI, p.Para lograr representaciones intermedias a las que FJ se puede aplicar a • Modificación de DJ usando HI: Filtro de muestras de DJ que están cubiertas por HI y construyen HJ usando FJ solo en las muestras restantes • Modificación de HJ usando FI: Filtro de hipótesis de HJ que sonNo es realizable usando FI • Modificación de HJ usando GI: si HJ está compuesto por varios subcomponentes, filtre los subcomponentes que no funcionan bien según GI •... Finalmente, muchos mensajes recibidos de otros que describen las propiedades de sus procesos de aprendizaje contendrán información sobre varios elementos de un paso de aprendizaje, lo que dará lugar a operaciones aún más complejas que dependen de qué tipos de información están disponibles.

Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 681 Figura 2: Captura de pantalla de nuestro sistema de simulación, que muestra datos de seguimiento de embarcaciones en línea para la Región 3 del Mar del Norte. Ejemplo de aplicación 3.1 Descripción del dominio Como ilustración de nuestro marco, presentamos un sistema de minería de datos basado en agente para la vigilancia basada en la agrupación utilizando datos AIS (sistema de identificación automática [1]). En nuestro dominio de la aplicación, diferentes agencias comerciales y gubernamentales rastrean los viajes de los barcos con el tiempo utilizando datos AIS que contienen información estructurada proporcionada automáticamente por barcos equipados con estaciones de AIS móviles de barcos a estaciones de tierra, otros barcos y aviones. Estos datos contienen la identidad, el tipo, la posición, el curso, la velocidad, el estado de navegación y otra información relacionada con la seguridad. La Figura 2 muestra una captura de pantalla de nuestro sistema de simulación. Es la tarea de las agencias de AIS detectar el comportamiento anómalos para alarmar a las unidades de policía/guardia costera para investigar más a fondo el comportamiento inusual y potencialmente sospechoso. Tal comportamiento puede incluir cosas como la desviación de las rutas estándar entre el origen declarado y el destino del viaje, encuentros inesperados cercanos entre diferentes buques en el mar o patrones inusuales en la elección del destino en múltiples viajes, tomando el tipo de embarcación e informes informadosflete en cuenta. Si bien las razones de tal comportamiento inusual pueden variar desde una coincidencia pura o problemas técnicos hasta actividades criminales (como contrabando, piratería, ataques terroristas/militares), es obviamente útil preprocesar la gran cantidad de datos de embarcaciones (seguimiento) que están disponiblesAntes de realizar un análisis posterior de expertos humanos. Para admitir esta tarea de preprocesamiento automatizada, el software utilizado por estas agencias aplica métodos de agrupación para identificar valores atípicos y marcarlos como entidades potencialmente sospechosas para el usuario humano. Sin embargo, muchas agencias activas en este dominio son empresas competidoras y usan sus conjuntos de datos (parcialmente superpuestos, pero distintos) e hipótesis de aprendizaje (modelos) como activos y, por lo tanto, no se puede esperar que colaboren de una manera totalmente cooperativa para mejorar los resultados generales del aprendizaje. Teniendo en cuenta que esta es la realidad del dominio en el mundo real, es fácil ver que un marco como el que hemos sugerido anteriormente podría ser útil para explotar el potencial de cooperación que no es explotado por los sistemas actuales.3.2 Diseño del sistema de aprendizaje distribuido basado en agentes Para describir un diseño concreto para el dominio AIS, necesitamos especificar los siguientes elementos del sistema general: 1. Los conjuntos de datos y los algoritmos de agrupación disponibles para los agentes individuales, 2. El mecanismo de interacción utilizado para intercambiar descripciones de los procesos de aprendizaje y 3. Los agentes del mecanismo de decisión se aplican para tomar decisiones de aprendizaje. Con respecto a 1., nuestros agentes están equipados con sus propios conjuntos de datos privados en forma de descripciones de embarcaciones. Las muestras de aprendizaje están representadas por tuplas que contienen datos sobre vasos individuales en términos de atributos a = {1 ,..., n} incluyendo cosas como ancho, longitud, etc. con dominios de valores reales ([ai] = r para todo i). En términos de algoritmo de aprendizaje, consideramos la agrupación con un número fijo de clústeres k que usan los algoritmos de agrupación de k-means y k-medoides [5] (se fijó el significado de que el algoritmo de aprendizaje siempre emitirá clusters K; sin embargo, permitimos que los agentes cambienel valor de k sobre diferentes ciclos de aprendizaje). Esto significa que el espacio de hipótesis puede definirse como H = {C1 ,..., ck | ci ∈ R | a |} es decir, el conjunto de todos los conjuntos posibles de k centroides de clúster en | a | espacio euclidiano de dimensiones. Para cada hipótesis H = C1 ,..., ck y cualquier punto de datos d ∈ × n i = 1 [ai] dominio dado [ai] Para el atributo ésimo de cada muestra, la asignación a los grupos viene dada por C (c1, .., ck, d) = arg min1≤j≤k | d - cj |es decir, D se asigna a ese clúster cuyo centroide está más cerca del punto de datos en términos de distancia euclidiana. Para fines de evaluación, cada conjunto de datos relacionados con un agente en particular I se divide inicialmente en un conjunto de capacitación DI y una validación VI. Luego, generamos un conjunto de embarcaciones falsas fi tal que | fi |= | Vi |. Estos dos conjuntos evalúan la capacidad de los agentes para detectar vasos sospechosos. Para esto, asignamos un valor de confianza R (H, D) a cada barco D: R (H, D) = 1 | D - CC (H, D) |donde C (H, D) es el índice del centroide más cercano. Según esta medida, clasificamos cualquier recipiente en Fi ∪ VI como falso si su valor R está por debajo de la mediana de todas las confidencias R (H, D) para d ∈ Fi ∪ VI. Con esto, podemos calcular la calidad Gi (h) ∈ R como la relación entre todos los vasos clasificados correctamente y todos los vasos en Fi ∪ VI. En lo que respecta a las preocupaciones 2., utilizamos un mecanismo de comercio de hipótesis basado en el protocolo de red de contrato simple (CNP) [20]: antes de cada iteración de aprendizaje, el problema de los agentes (transmitidos públicamente) llamadas para proposiciones (CFP), anunciando su propio modelo numérico de calidad de la calidad numérica. En otras palabras, el iniciador de un CNP describe su propio estado de aprendizaje actual como (∗, ∗, ∗, gi (h), ∗) donde h es su hipótesis/modelo actual. Suponemos que los agentes son sinceros cuando anuncian la calidad de su modelo, pero tenga en cuenta que esta calidad podría ser de relevancia limitada para otros agentes, ya que pueden especializarse en regiones específicas del espacio de datos no relacionado con el conjunto de pruebas del remitente del CFP. Posteriormente, (algunos) agentes pueden emitir ofertas en las que anuncian, a su vez, la calidad de su propio modelo. Si el 682 el sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y los sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) son aceptadas por el iniciador del protocolo que emitió el PCP, los agentes intercambian sus hipótesis y la próxima iteración de aprendizaje. Para describir lo que es necesario para 3., tenemos que especificar (i) bajo las condiciones de las condiciones que los agentes presentan ofertas en respuesta a un PCP, (ii) cuando aceptan ofertas en el proceso de negociación de CNP y (iii) cómo integran el recibidoinformación en su propio proceso de aprendizaje. Con respecto a (i) y (ii), empleamos una regla muy simple que es idéntica en ambos casos: dejemos que sean la calidad del modelo propio y que se anuncie el CFP (o la oferta más alta, respectivamente). Si G> G respondemos a la CFP (acepte la oferta), de lo contrario, responda al CFP (aceptar la oferta) con probabilidad P (G /G) e ignorarla (rechazar) más. Si dos agentes llegan a un acuerdo, intercambian sus hipótesis de aprendizaje (modelos). En nuestros experimentos, G y G son calculados por un agente adicional que actúa como un mecanismo de validación global para todos los agentes (en un entorno más realista, tendrá que proporcionar un mecanismo de comparación para diferentes funciones G). En cuanto a (iii), cada agente utiliza un operador de fusión de modelo único tomado de las siguientes dos clases de operadores (HJ es el modelo de receptores propios y HI es el modelo de proveedores): • Ph → H (HI, HJ): - M-Únase: los mejores grupos (en términos de cobertura de DJ) de la hipótesis Hi se agregan a HJ.- M-Select: el conjunto de los mejores grupos (en términos de cobertura de DJ) de la Unión Hi ∪HJ se elige como un nuevo modelo.(A diferencia de M-Join, este método no prefiere los grupos propios sobre otros.) • Ph → D (HI, DJ):-M-Filter: Los mejores grupos (como anteriormente) de HI se identifican y se adhieren a un nuevo modelo formadoAl usar esas muestras no cubiertas por estos grupos que aplican el propio algoritmo de aprendizaje FJ. Cada vez que M es lo suficientemente grande como para abarcar todos los grupos, simplemente escribimos unir o filtrar para ellos. En la Sección 4 analizamos el rendimiento de cada una de estas dos clases para diferentes opciones de m.Es de destacar que este sistema de minería de datos distribuidos basado en agentes es una de las instancias concebibles más simples de nuestra arquitectura abstracta. Si bien anteriormente lo hemos aplicado también a una arquitectura basada en el mercado más compleja utilizando estudiantes de programación de lógica inductiva en un dominio de logística de transporte [22], creemos que el sistema descrito aquí es lo suficientemente complejo como para ilustrar las decisiones clave de diseño involucradas en el uso de nuestro marcoy proporciona soluciones de ejemplo simples para estos problemas de diseño.4. Resultados experimentales La Figura 3 muestra los resultados obtenidos de las simulaciones con tres agentes de aprendizaje en el sistema anterior utilizando los métodos de agrupación de K-means y K-Medoides respectivamente. Participamos el conjunto de datos total de 300 barcos en tres conjuntos de disjunto de 100 muestras cada una y asignamos cada una de estas a un agente de aprendizaje. El agente único está aprendiendo de todo el conjunto de datos. El parámetro K se establece en 10, ya que este es el valor óptimo para el conjunto de datos total de acuerdo con el índice Davies-Bouldin [9]. Para M-Select asumimos M = K que logra una Figura 3 constante 3: Resultados de rendimiento obtenidos para diferentes operaciones de integración en sociedades de alumnos homogéneas que utilizan el tamaño del modelo del modelo de métodos K-means (TOP) y K-Medoides (inferior). Para M-Join y M-Filter asumimos que M = 3 limita el grado en que los modelos aumentan con el tiempo. Durante cada experimento, los agentes de aprendizaje reciben descripciones de barcos en lotes de 10 muestras. Entre estos lotes, hay suficiente tiempo para intercambiar los modelos entre los agentes y recomputar los modelos si es necesario. Cada barco se describe utilizando atributos de ancho, longitud, borrador y velocidad con el objetivo de aprender a detectar qué buques han proporcionado descripciones falsas de sus propias propiedades. El conjunto de validación contiene 100 barcos falsos reales y 100 generados al azar. Para generar propiedades suficientemente realistas para los barcos falsos, sus valores de atributos individuales se toman de los barcos seleccionados al azar en el conjunto de validación (de modo que cada muestra falsa es una combinación de valores de atributo de varias naves existentes). En estos experimentos, estamos interesados principalmente en investigar si una forma simple de intercambio de conocimientos entre los agentes de aprendizaje egoístas podría mejorar el rendimiento del agente en comparación con una configuración de alumnos aislados. De este modo, distinguimos entre sociedades de alumnos homogéneas donde todos los agentes usan el mismo algoritmo de agrupación y los heterogéneos donde diferentes agentes usan diferentes algoritmos. Como se puede ver en los gráficos de rendimiento en la Figura 3 (caso homogéneo) y 4 (caso heterogéneo, dos agentes usan el mismo método y un agente usa el otro) Este es claramente el caso de las operaciones de integración de unión y filtro (sin restricciones) (m = k) En ambos casos. Esto es bastante natural, ya que estas operaciones equivalen a compartir todo el conocimiento del modelo disponible entre los agentes (bajo restricciones apropiadas dependiendo de cuán beneficioso parezca el intercambio a los agentes). Podemos ver que la calidad de estas operaciones está muy cerca del agente único que tiene acceso a todos los datos de capacitación. Para los métodos restringidos (m <k) m-unes, m-filter y m-select, también podemos observar una distinción interesante, la sexta intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 683 Figura 4: Resultados de rendimiento obtenidos para diferentes operaciones de integración en sociedades heterogéneas con la mayoría de los alumnos que usan los métodos de K-means (Top) y K-Medoides (abajo) que son, a saber, que estosActuar de manera similar al caso de alumno aislado en grupos de agentes homogéneos, pero mejor que los alumnos aislados en sociedades más heterogéneas. Esto sugiere que los alumnos heterogéneos pueden beneficiarse incluso del intercambio de conocimientos bastante limitado (y esto es lo que el uso de un M = 3 bastante pequeño equivale a que K = 10), mientras que esto no siempre es cierto para los agentes homogéneos. Esto ilustra bien cómo los diferentes algoritmos de aprendizaje o minería de datos pueden especializarse en diferentes partes del espacio de problemas y luego integrar sus resultados locales para lograr un mejor rendimiento individual. Además de estos obvios beneficios de rendimiento, la integración de los resultados de aprendizaje parcial también puede tener otras ventajas: la operación M-Filter, por ejemplo, disminuye el número de muestras de aprendizaje y, por lo tanto, puede acelerar el proceso de aprendizaje. El número relativo de ejemplos filtrados medidos en nuestros experimentos se muestra en la siguiente tabla.K-means K-Medoids que filtran 30-40 % 10-20 % M-filtering 20-30 % 5-15 % La conclusión general de la que podemos sacar de estos experimentos iniciales con nuestra arquitectura es que, dado que una aplicación muy simplista de sus principios haProbado de mejorar el rendimiento de los agentes de aprendizaje individuales, vale la pena investigar formas más complejas de intercambio de información sobre los procesos de aprendizaje entre los alumnos autónomos.5. Trabajo relacionado ya hemos mencionado el trabajo sobre el aprendizaje automático distribuido (no agente) y la minería de datos en el capítulo introductorio, por lo que en esta sección nos restringiremos a los enfoques que están más estrechamente relacionados con nuestra perspectiva de los sistemas de aprendizaje distribuidos. Muy a menudo, los enfoques que supuestamente están basados en el agente ignoran la autonomía del agente y prescriben procedimientos locales de toma de decisiones a priori. Un ejemplo típico para este tipo de sistema es el sugerido por Caragea et al.[6] que se basa en un enfoque de máquina de vectores de soporte distribuido donde los agentes unen incrementalmente sus conjuntos de datos de acuerdo con un algoritmo distribuido fijo. Un ejemplo similar es el trabajo de Weiss [24], donde los grupos de agentes clasificadores aprenden a organizar su actividad para optimizar el comportamiento del sistema global. La diferencia entre este tipo de sistemas de aprendizaje basados en agentes colaborativos [16] y nuestro propio marco es que estos enfoques asumen un objetivo de aprendizaje conjunto que todos los agentes perseguen en colaboración. Muchos enfoques dependen en gran medida de una suposición de homogeneidad: Plaza y Ontanon [15] sugieren métodos para la reutilización inteligente basada en agentes en el razonamiento basado en casos, pero solo son aplicables a sociedades de alumnos homogéneos (y acuñado hacia un método de aprendizaje específico). Klusch et al. Presentan un método basado en agente para integrar procesos de análisis de clúster distribuidos utilizando una estimación de densidad.[13] que también está diseñado específicamente para un algoritmo de aprendizaje particular. Lo mismo es cierto para [22, 23] que presentan mecanismos basados en el mercado para agregar la producción de múltiples agentes de aprendizaje, a pesar de que estos enfoques consideran mecanismos de interacción más interesantes entre los alumnos. También se han propuesto varios enfoques para compartir datos de aprendizaje [18]: Grecu y Becker [12] sugieren un intercambio de muestras de aprendizaje entre los agentes y Ghosh et al.[11] es un paso en la dirección correcta en términos de revelar solo información parcial sobre el proceso de aprendizaje, ya que trata el intercambio de información limitado en la agrupación distribuida. Papyrus [3] es un sistema que proporciona un lenguaje de marcado para la metadescripción de datos, hipótesis y resultados intermedios y permite un intercambio de toda esta información entre diferentes nodos, sin embargo, con un objetivo estrictamente cooperativo de distribuir la carga para datos distribuidos masivamentetareas mineras. El sistema masculino [19] era un sistema de aprendizaje multiagente muy temprano en el que los agentes utilizaron un enfoque de pizarra para comunicar sus hipótesis. Los agentes pudieron criticar hipótesis de los demás hasta llegar a un acuerdo. Sin embargo, todos los agentes en este sistema eran idénticos y el sistema era estrictamente cooperativo. El sistema de animales [10] se utilizó para simular el aprendizaje multiestrategia mediante la combinación de dos o más técnicas de aprendizaje (representadas por agentes heterogéneos) para superar las debilidades en los algoritmos individuales, sin embargo, también fue un sistema estrictamente cooperativo. Como muestran estos ejemplos y, según nuestro conocimiento, no ha habido intentos previos de proporcionar un marco que pueda acomodar agentes de aprendizaje independientes y heterogéneos y esto puede considerarse como la principal contribución de nuestro trabajo.6. Conclusión En este documento, describimos un marco genérico y abstracto para el aprendizaje automático distribuido y la minería de datos. Este marco constituye, hasta donde sabemos, el primer intento 684 el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) para capturar formas complejas de interacción entre los alumnos heterogéneos y/o interesados en una arquitectura que puede usarse como base para implementar sistemas que utilizan mecanismos de interacción y razonamiento complejos para permitir agentesPara informar y mejorar sus habilidades de aprendizaje con la información proporcionada por otros alumnos en el sistema, siempre que todos los agentes participen en una actividad de aprendizaje suficientemente similar. Para ilustrar que los principios abstractos de nuestra arquitectura pueden convertirse en sistemas concretos y computacionales, describimos un sistema de agrupación distribuido basado en el mercado que se evaluó en el dominio del seguimiento de los vasos para identificar el comportamiento desviado o sospechoso. Aunque nuestros resultados experimentales solo insinúan el potencial de usar nuestra arquitectura, subrayan que lo que estamos proponiendo es factible en principio y puede tener efectos beneficiosos incluso en su instanciación más simple. Sin embargo, hay una serie de problemas que no hemos abordado en la presentación de la arquitectura y su evaluación empírica: en primer lugar, no hemos considerado el costo de la comunicación y suponemos la suposición implícita de que la comunicación requerida es de forma gratuita. Por supuesto, esto es inadecuado si queremos evaluar nuestro método en términos del esfuerzo total requerido para producir una cierta calidad de resultados de aprendizaje. En segundo lugar, no hemos experimentado con agentes que usan algoritmos de aprendizaje completamente diferentes (por ejemplo, simbólicos y numéricos). En los sistemas compuestos por agentes completamente diferentes, las circunstancias bajo las cuales se puede lograr el intercambio de información exitoso puede ser muy diferente de los descritos aquí, y pueden ser necesarios métodos de comunicación y razonamiento mucho más complejos para lograr una integración útil de los diferentes procesos de aprendizaje de los agentes. Finalmente, se deben desarrollar criterios de evaluación más sofisticados para tales arquitecturas de aprendizaje distribuido para arrojar algo de luz sobre cuáles deberían ser las medidas correctas de optimización para los agentes de razonamiento y comunicación de forma autónoma. Estos problemas, junto con una investigación más sistemática y exhaustiva de los mecanismos avanzados de interacción y comunicación para agentes distribuidos, colaboradores y competidores serán objeto de nuestro trabajo futuro sobre el tema.

        "A Framework for Agent-Based Distributed Machine Learning and Data Mining Jan Tozicka Gerstner Laboratory Czech Technical University Technick«a 2, Prague, 166 27 Czech Republic tozicka@labe.felk.cvut.cz Michael Rovatsos School of Informatics The University of Edinburgh Edinburgh EH8 9LE United Kingdom mrovatso@inf.ed.ac.uk Michal Pechoucek Gerstner Laboratory Czech Technical University Technick«a 2, Prague, 166 27 Czech Republic pechouc@labe.felk.cvut.cz ABSTRACT This paper proposes a framework for agent-based distributed machine learning and data mining based on (i) the exchange of meta-level descriptions of individual learning processes among agents and (ii) online reasoning about learning success and learning progress by learning agents.",
        "We present an abstract architecture that enables agents to exchange models of their local learning processes and introduces a number of different methods for integrating these processes.",
        "This allows us to apply existing agent interaction mechanisms to distributed machine learning tasks, thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available in agent-based computing, and enables agents to engage in meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions.",
        "We apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which different learners may be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning algorithms.",
        "We report on experimental results obtained using this system, review related work on the subject, and discuss potential future extensions to the framework.",
        "General Terms Theory Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Multiagent Systems 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
        "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
        "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
        "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
        "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
        "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
        "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
        "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
        "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
        "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
        "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
        "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
        "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
        "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
        "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
        "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
        "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
        "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
        "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
        "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
        "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
        "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
        "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
        "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
        "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
        "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
        "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
        "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
        "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
        "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 679 training function ht performance measure solution quality qtgtft training set Dt hypothesis hypothesis ht−1 Figure 1: A generic model of a learning step i.e. the only requirement the transition relation →⊆ L × L makes is that the new hypothesis is the result of training the old hypothesis on all available sample data that belongs to the current step.",
        "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
        "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
        "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
        "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
        "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
        "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
        "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
        "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
        "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
        "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
        "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
        "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
        "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
        "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
        "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
        "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
        "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
        "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
        "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

        "This is too abstract and unspecific for our purposes: While it describes what agents should do (transform the settings for the next learning step in an optimal way), it doesnt specify how this can be achieved in practice. 2.2 Integrating learning process information To specify how an agents learning process can be affected by integrating information received from others, we need to flesh out the details of how the learning steps it will perform can be modified using incoming information about learning processes described by other agents (this includes the acquisition of new learning data from the environment as a special case).",
        "In the most general case, we can specify this in terms of the potential modifications to the existing information about learning histories that can be performed using new information.",
        "For ease of presentation, we will assume that agents are stationary learning processes that can only record the previously executed learning step and only exchange information about this one individual learning step (our model can be easily extended to cater for more complex settings).",

        "Considering all possible interactions at an abstract level, we basically obtain a matrix of possibilities for modifications of js learning step specification as shown in Table 1.",
        "In this matrix, each entry specifies a family of integration functions pc→c 1 , . . . , pc→c kc→c where c, c ∈ {D, H, f, g, h} and which define how agent js component cj will be modified using the information ci provided about (the same or a different component of) is learning step by applying pc→c r (ci, cj) for some r ∈ {1, . . . , kc→c }.",
        "To put it more simply, the collections of p-functions an agent j uses specifies how it will modify its own learning behaviour using information obtained from i.",
        "For the diagonal of this matrix, which contains the most common ways of integrating new information in ones own learning model, obvious ways of modifying ones own learning process include replacing cj by ci or ignoring ci altogether.",
        "More complex/subtle forms of learning process integration include: • Modification of Dj: append Di to Dj; filter out all elements from Dj which also appear in Di; append Di to Dj discarding all elements with attributes outside ranges which affect gj, or those elements already correctly classified by hj; • Modification of Hi: use the union/intersection of Hi and Hj; alternatively, discard elements of Hj that are inconsistent with Dj in the process of intersection or union, or filter out elements that cannot be obtained using fj (unless fj is modified at the same time) • Modification of fj: modify parameters or background knowledge of fj using information about fi; assess their relevance by simulating previous learning steps on Dj using gj and discard those that do not help improve own performance • Modification of hj: combine hj with hi using (say) logical or mathematical operators; make the use of hi contingent on a pre-integration assessment of its quality using own data Dj and gj While this list does not include fully fledged, concrete integration operations for learning processes, it is indicative of the broad range of interactions between individual agents learning processes that our framework enables.",
        "Note that the list does not include any modifications to gj.",
        "This is because we do not allow modifications to the agents own quality measure as this would render the model of rational (learning) action useless (if the quality measure is relative and volatile, we cannot objectively judge learning performance).",
        "Also note that some of the above examples require consulting other elements of lj than those appearing as arguments of the p-operations; we omit these for ease of notation, but emphasise that information-rich operations will involve consulting many different aspects of lj.",
        "Apart from operations along the diagonal of the matrix, more exotic integration operations are conceivable that combine information about different components.",
        "In theory we could fill most of the matrix with entries for them, but for lack of space we list only a few examples: • Modification of Dj using fi: pre-process samples in fi, e.g. to achieve intermediate representations that fj can be applied to • Modification of Dj using hi: filter out samples from Dj that are covered by hi and build hj using fj only on remaining samples • Modification of Hj using fi: filter out hypotheses from Hj that are not realisable using fi • Modification of hj using gi: if hj is composed of several sub-components, filter out those sub-components that do not perform well according to gi • . . .",
        "Finally, many messages received from others describing properties of their learning processes will contain information about several elements of a learning step, giving rise to yet more complex operations that depend on which kinds of information are available.",

        "It is the task of AIS agencies to detect anomalous behaviour so as to alarm police/coastguard units to further investigate unusual, potentially suspicious behaviour.",
        "Such behaviour might include things such as deviation from the standard routes between the declared origin and destination of the journey, unexpected close encounters between different vessels on sea, or unusual patterns in the choice of destination over multiple journeys, taking the type of vessel and reported freight into account.",
        "While the reasons for such unusual behaviour may range from pure coincidence or technical problems to criminal activity (such as smuggling, piracy, terrorist/military attacks) it is obviously useful to pre-process the huge amount of vessel (tracking) data that is available before engaging in further analysis by human experts.",
        "To support this automated pre-processing task, software used by these agencies applies clustering methods in order to identify outliers and flag those as potentially suspicious entities to the human user.",

        "The datasets and clustering algorithms available to individual agents, 2. the interaction mechanism used for exchanging descriptions of learning processes, and 3. the decision mechanism agents apply to make learning decisions.",
        "Regarding 1., our agents are equipped with their own private datasets in the form of vessel descriptions.",
        "Learning samples are represented by tuples containing data about individual vessels in terms of attributes A = {1, . . . , n} including things such as width, length, etc. with real-valued domains ([Ai] = R for all i).",
        "In terms of learning algorithm, we consider clustering with a fixed number of k clusters using the k-means and k-medoids clustering algorithms [5] (fixed meaning that the learning algorithm will always output k clusters; however, we allow agents to change the value of k over different learning cycles).",
        "This means that the hypothesis space can be defined as H = { c1, . . . , ck |ci ∈ R|A| } i.e. the set of all possible sets of k cluster centroids in |A|-dimensional Euclidean space.",
        "For each hypothesis h = c1, . . . , ck and any data point d ∈ ×n i=1[Ai] given domain [Ai] for the ith attribute of each sample, the assignment to clusters is given by C( c1, . . . , ck , d) = arg min 1≤j≤k |d − cj| i.e. d is assigned to that cluster whose centroid is closest to the data point in terms of Euclidean distance.",
        "For evaluation purposes, each dataset pertaining to a particular agent i is initially split into a training set Di and a validation Vi.",
        "Then, we generate a set of fake vessels Fi such that |Fi| = |Vi|.",
        "These two sets assess the agents ability to detect suspicious vessels.",
        "For this, we assign a confidence value r(h, d) to every ship d: r(h, d) = 1 |d − cC(h,d)| where C(h, d) is the index of the nearest centroid.",
        "Based on this measure, we classify any vessel in Fi ∪ Vi as fake if its r-value is below the median of all the confidences r(h, d) for d ∈ Fi ∪ Vi.",
        "With this, we can compute the quality gi(h) ∈ R as the ratio between all correctly classified vessels and all vessels in Fi ∪ Vi.",
        "As concerns 2., we use a simple Contract-Net Protocol (CNP) [20] based hypothesis trading mechanism: Before each learning iteration, agents issue (publicly broadcasted) Calls-For-Proposals (CfPs), advertising their own numerical model quality.",
        "In other words, the initiator of a CNP describes its own current learning state as (∗, ∗, ∗, gi(h), ∗) where h is their current hypothesis/model.",
        "We assume that agents are sincere when advertising their model quality, but note that this quality might be of limited relevance to other agents as they may specialise on specific regions of the data space not related to the test set of the sender of the CfP.",

        "To describe what is necessary for 3., we have to specify (i) under which conditions agents submit bids in response to a CfP, (ii) when they accept bids in the CNP negotiation process, and (iii) how they integrate the received information in their own learning process.",
        "Concerning (i) and (ii), we employ a very simple rule that is identical in both cases: let g be ones own model quality and g that advertised by the CfP (or highest bid, respectively).",
        "If g > g we respond to the CfP (accept the bid), else respond to the CfP (accept the bid) with probability P(g /g) and ignore (reject) it else.",
        "If two agents make a deal, they exchange their learning hypotheses (models).",
        "In our experiments, g and g are calculated by an additional agent that acts as a global validation mechanism for all agents (in a more realistic setting a comparison mechanism for different g functions would have to be provided).",
        "As for (iii), each agent uses a single model merging operator taken from the following two classes of operators (hj is the receivers own model and hi is the providers model): • ph→h (hi, hj) : - m-join: The m best clusters (in terms of coverage of Dj) from hypothesis hi are appended to hj. - m-select: The set of the m best clusters (in terms of coverage of Dj) from the union hi ∪hj is chosen as a new model. (Unlike m-join this method does not prefer own clusters over others.) • ph→D (hi, Dj) : - m-filter: The m best clusters (as above) from hi are identified and appended to a new model formed by using those samples not covered by these clusters applying the own learning algorithm fj.",
        "Whenever m is large enough to encompass all clusters, we simply write join or filter for them.",
        "In section 4 we analyse the performance of each of these two classes for different choices of m. It is noteworthy that this agent-based distributed data mining system is one of the simplest conceivable instances of our abstract architecture.",
        "While we have previously applied it also to a more complex market-based architecture using Inductive Logic Programming learners in a transport logistics domain [22], we believe that the system described here is complex enough to illustrate the key design decisions involved in using our framework and provides simple example solutions for these design issues. 4.",

        "The Single Agent is learning from the whole dataset.",

        "During each experiment the learning agents receive ship descriptions in batches of 10 samples.",
        "Between these batches, there is enough time to exchange the models among the agents and recompute the models if necessary.",
        "Each ship is described using width, length, draught and speed attributes with the goal of learning to detect which vessels have provided fake descriptions of their own properties.",
        "The validation set contains 100 real and 100 randomly generated fake ships.",
        "To generate sufficiently realistic properties for fake ships, their individual attribute values are taken from randomly selected ships in the validation set (so that each fake sample is a combination of attribute values of several existing ships).",
        "In these experiments, we are mainly interested in investigating whether a simple form of knowledge sharing between self-interested learning agents could improve agent performance compared to a setting of isolated learners.",
        "Thereby, we distinguish between homogeneous learner societies where all agents use the same clustering algorithm and heterogeneous ones where different agents use different algorithms.",
        "As can be seen from the performance plots in Figure 3 (homogeneous case) and 4 (heterogeneous case, two agents use the same method and one agent uses the other) this is clearly the case for the (unrestricted) join and filter integration operations (m = k) in both cases.",
        "This is quite natural, as these operations amount to sharing all available model knowledge among agents (under appropriate constraints depending on how beneficial the exchange seems to the agents).",
        "We can see that the quality of these operations is very close to the Single Agent that has access to all training data.",

        "This suggests that heterogeneous learners are able to benefit even from rather limited knowledge sharing (and this is what using a rather small m = 3 amounts to given that k = 10) while this is not always true for homogeneous agents.",
        "This nicely illustrates how different learning or data mining algorithms can specialise on different parts of the problem space and then integrate their local results to achieve better individual performance.",
        "Apart from these obvious performance benefits, integrating partial learning results can also have other advantages: The m-filter operation, for example, decreases the number of learning samples and thus can speed up the learning process.",
        "The relative number of filtered examples measured in our experiments is shown in the following table. k-means k-medoids filtering 30-40 % 10-20 % m-filtering 20-30 % 5-15 % The overall conclusion we can draw from these initial experiments with our architecture is that since a very simplistic application of its principles has proven capable of improving the performance of individual learning agents, it is worthwhile investigating more complex forms of information exchange about learning processes among autonomous learners. 5.",
        "RELATED WORK We have already mentioned work on distributed (nonagent) machine learning and data mining in the introductory chapter, so in this section we shall restrict ourselves to approaches that are more closely related to our outlook on distributed learning systems.",
        "Very often, approaches that are allegedly agent-based completely disregard agent autonomy and prescribe local decision-making procedures a priori.",
        "A typical example for this type of system is the one suggested by Caragea et al. [6] which is based on a distributed support-vector machine approach where agents incrementally join their datasets together according to a fixed distributed algorithm.",
        "A similar example is the work of Weiss [24], where groups of classifier agents learn to organise their activity so as to optimise global system behaviour.",
        "The difference between this kind of collaborative agentbased learning systems [16] and our own framework is that these approaches assume a joint learning goal that is pursued collaboratively by all agents.",
        "Many approaches rely heavily on a homogeneity assumption: Plaza and Ontanon [15] suggest methods for agentbased intelligent reuse of cases in case-based reasoning but is only applicable to societies of homogeneous learners (and coined towards a specific learning method).",
        "An agentbased method for integrating distributed cluster analysis processes using density estimation is presented by Klusch et al. [13] which is also specifically designed for a particular learning algorithm.",
        "The same is true of [22, 23] which both present market-based mechanisms for aggregating the output of multiple learning agents, even though these approaches consider more interesting interaction mechanisms among learners.",
        "A number of approaches for sharing learning data [18] have also been proposed: Grecu and Becker [12] suggest an exchange of learning samples among agents, and Ghosh et al. [11] is a step in the right direction in terms of revealing only partial information about ones learning process as it deals with limited information sharing in distributed clustering.",
        "Papyrus [3] is a system that provides a markup language for meta-description of data, hypotheses and intermediate results and allows for an exchange of all this information among different nodes, however with a strictly cooperative goal of distributing the load for massively distributed data mining tasks.",
        "The MALE system [19] was a very early multiagent learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses.",
        "Agents were able to critique each others hypotheses until agreement was reached.",
        "However, all agents in this system were identical and the system was strictly cooperative.",
        "The ANIMALS system [10] was used to simulate multistrategy learning by combining two or more learning techniques (represented by heterogeneous agents) in order to overcome weaknesses in the individual algorithms, yet it was also a strictly cooperative system.",
        "As these examples show and to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to provide a framework that can accommodate both independent and heterogeneous learning agents and this can be regarded as the main contribution of our work. 6.",

        "This framework constitutes, to our knowledge, the first attempt 684 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) to capture complex forms of interaction between heterogeneous and/or self-interested learners in an architecture that can be used as the foundation for implementing systems that use complex interaction and reasoning mechanisms to enable agents to inform and improve their learning abilities with information provided by other learners in the system, provided that all agents engage in a sufficiently similar learning activity.",
        "To illustrate that the abstract principles of our architecture can be turned into concrete, computational systems, we described a market-based distributed clustering system which was evaluated in the domain of vessel tracking for purposes of identifying deviant or suspicious behaviour.",
        "Although our experimental results only hint at the potential of using our architecture, they underline that what we are proposing is feasible in principle and can have beneficial effects even in its most simple instantiation.",
        "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
        "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
        "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
        "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
        "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",
        "These issues, together with a more systematic and thorough investigation of advanced interaction and communication mechanisms for distributed, collaborating and competing agents will be the subject of our future work on the subject.",

                "We present an abstract architecture that enables agents to exchange models of their local learning processes and introduces a number of different methods for integrating these processes.",
                "This allows us to apply existing <br>agent</br> interaction mechanisms to distributed machine learning tasks, thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available in <br>agent</br>-based computing, and enables agents to engage in meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions.",
                "We apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which different learners may be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning algorithms.",
                "We report on experimental results obtained using this system, review related work on the subject, and discuss potential future extensions to the framework.",
                "General Terms Theory Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Multiagent Systems 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of <br>agent</br> design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or <br>agent</br> objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the <br>agent</br> metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-<br>agent</br>) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by <br>agent</br> technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning <br>agent</br>, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-<br>agent</br> Systems (AAMAS 07) 679 training function ht performance measure solution quality qtgtft training set Dt hypothesis hypothesis ht−1 Figure 1: A generic model of a learning step i.e. the only requirement the transition relation →⊆ L × L makes is that the new hypothesis is the result of training the old hypothesis on all available sample data that belongs to the current step.",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning <br>agent</br> is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
                "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
                "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the <br>agent</br> as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
                "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
                "The goal of the <br>agent</br> is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
                "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

                "In the most general case, we can specify this in terms of the potential modifications to the existing information about learning histories that can be performed using new information.",
                "For ease of presentation, we will assume that agents are stationary learning processes that can only record the previously executed learning step and only exchange information about this one individual learning step (our model can be easily extended to cater for more complex settings).",

                "To put it more simply, the collections of p-functions an <br>agent</br> j uses specifies how it will modify its own learning behaviour using information obtained from i.",
                "For the diagonal of this matrix, which contains the most common ways of integrating new information in ones own learning model, obvious ways of modifying ones own learning process include replacing cj by ci or ignoring ci altogether.",
                "More complex/subtle forms of learning process integration include: • Modification of Dj: append Di to Dj; filter out all elements from Dj which also appear in Di; append Di to Dj discarding all elements with attributes outside ranges which affect gj, or those elements already correctly classified by hj; • Modification of Hi: use the union/intersection of Hi and Hj; alternatively, discard elements of Hj that are inconsistent with Dj in the process of intersection or union, or filter out elements that cannot be obtained using fj (unless fj is modified at the same time) • Modification of fj: modify parameters or background knowledge of fj using information about fi; assess their relevance by simulating previous learning steps on Dj using gj and discard those that do not help improve own performance • Modification of hj: combine hj with hi using (say) logical or mathematical operators; make the use of hi contingent on a pre-integration assessment of its quality using own data Dj and gj While this list does not include fully fledged, concrete integration operations for learning processes, it is indicative of the broad range of interactions between individual agents learning processes that our framework enables.",
                "Note that the list does not include any modifications to gj.",
                "This is because we do not allow modifications to the agents own quality measure as this would render the model of rational (learning) action useless (if the quality measure is relative and volatile, we cannot objectively judge learning performance).",
                "Also note that some of the above examples require consulting other elements of lj than those appearing as arguments of the p-operations; we omit these for ease of notation, but emphasise that information-rich operations will involve consulting many different aspects of lj.",
                "Apart from operations along the diagonal of the matrix, more exotic integration operations are conceivable that combine information about different components.",
                "In theory we could fill most of the matrix with entries for them, but for lack of space we list only a few examples: • Modification of Dj using fi: pre-process samples in fi, e.g. to achieve intermediate representations that fj can be applied to • Modification of Dj using hi: filter out samples from Dj that are covered by hi and build hj using fj only on remaining samples • Modification of Hj using fi: filter out hypotheses from Hj that are not realisable using fi • Modification of hj using gi: if hj is composed of several sub-components, filter out those sub-components that do not perform well according to gi • . . .",

(Unlike m-join this method does not prefer own clusters over others.) • ph→D (hi, Dj) : - m-filter: The m best clusters (as above) from hi are identified and appended to a new model formed by using those samples not covered by these clusters applying the own learning algorithm fj.",

                "RELATED WORK We have already mentioned work on distributed (nonagent) machine learning and data mining in the introductory chapter, so in this section we shall restrict ourselves to approaches that are more closely related to our outlook on distributed learning systems.",
                "Very often, approaches that are allegedly <br>agent</br>-based completely disregard <br>agent</br> autonomy and prescribe local decision-making procedures a priori.",
                "A typical example for this type of system is the one suggested by Caragea et al. [6] which is based on a distributed support-vector machine approach where agents incrementally join their datasets together according to a fixed distributed algorithm.",

                "An agentbased method for integrating distributed cluster analysis processes using density estimation is presented by Klusch et al. [13] which is also specifically designed for a particular learning algorithm.",
                "The same is true of [22, 23] which both present market-based mechanisms for aggregating the output of multiple learning agents, even though these approaches consider more interesting interaction mechanisms among learners.",
                "A number of approaches for sharing learning data [18] have also been proposed: Grecu and Becker [12] suggest an exchange of learning samples among agents, and Ghosh et al. [11] is a step in the right direction in terms of revealing only partial information about ones learning process as it deals with limited information sharing in distributed clustering.",
                "Papyrus [3] is a system that provides a markup language for meta-description of data, hypotheses and intermediate results and allows for an exchange of all this information among different nodes, however with a strictly cooperative goal of distributing the load for massively distributed data mining tasks.",
                "The MALE system [19] was a very early multiagent learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses.",
                "Agents were able to critique each others hypotheses until agreement was reached.",
                "However, all agents in this system were identical and the system was strictly cooperative.",
                "The ANIMALS system [10] was used to simulate multistrategy learning by combining two or more learning techniques (represented by heterogeneous agents) in order to overcome weaknesses in the individual algorithms, yet it was also a strictly cooperative system.",
                "As these examples show and to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to provide a framework that can accommodate both independent and heterogeneous learning agents and this can be regarded as the main contribution of our work. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION In this paper, we outlined a generic, abstract framework for distributed machine learning and data mining.",

                "To illustrate that the abstract principles of our architecture can be turned into concrete, computational systems, we described a market-based distributed clustering system which was evaluated in the domain of vessel tracking for purposes of identifying deviant or suspicious behaviour.",
                "Although our experimental results only hint at the potential of using our architecture, they underline that what we are proposing is feasible in principle and can have beneficial effects even in its most simple instantiation.",
                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",
                "These issues, together with a more systematic and thorough investigation of advanced interaction and communication mechanisms for distributed, collaborating and competing agents will be the subject of our future work on the subject.",

                "We present an abstract architecture that enables agents to exchange models of their local learning processes and introduces a number of different methods for integrating these processes.",
                "This allows us to apply existing agent interaction mechanisms to distributed <br>machine learning</br> tasks, thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available in agent-based computing, and enables agents to engage in meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions.",
                "We apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which different learners may be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning algorithms.",
                "We report on experimental results obtained using this system, review related work on the subject, and discuss potential future extensions to the framework.",
                "General Terms Theory Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Multiagent Systems 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of <br>machine learning</br> and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",

                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
                "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
                "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
                "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
                "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed <br>machine learning</br> and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

                "This is too abstract and unspecific for our purposes: While it describes what agents should do (transform the settings for the next learning step in an optimal way), it doesnt specify how this can be achieved in practice. 2.2 Integrating learning process information To specify how an agents learning process can be affected by integrating information received from others, we need to flesh out the details of how the learning steps it will perform can be modified using incoming information about learning processes described by other agents (this includes the acquisition of new learning data from the environment as a special case).",
                "In the most general case, we can specify this in terms of the potential modifications to the existing information about learning histories that can be performed using new information.",
                "For ease of presentation, we will assume that agents are stationary learning processes that can only record the previously executed learning step and only exchange information about this one individual learning step (our model can be easily extended to cater for more complex settings).",

                "In this matrix, each entry specifies a family of integration functions pc→c 1 , . . . , pc→c kc→c where c, c ∈ {D, H, f, g, h} and which define how agent js component cj will be modified using the information ci provided about (the same or a different component of) is learning step by applying pc→c r (ci, cj) for some r ∈ {1, . . . , kc→c }.",

                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",

                "We present an abstract architecture that enables agents to exchange models of their local learning processes and introduces a number of different methods for integrating these processes.",
                "This allows us to apply existing agent interaction mechanisms to distributed machine learning tasks, thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available in agent-based computing, and enables agents to engage in meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions.",
                "We apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which different learners may be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning algorithms.",
                "We report on experimental results obtained using this system, review related work on the subject, and discuss potential future extensions to the framework.",
                "General Terms Theory Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Multiagent Systems 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",

                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
                "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
                "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
                "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
                "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

                "This is too abstract and unspecific for our purposes: While it describes what agents should do (transform the settings for the next learning step in an optimal way), it doesnt specify how this can be achieved in practice. 2.2 Integrating learning process information To specify how an agents learning process can be affected by integrating information received from others, we need to flesh out the details of how the learning steps it will perform can be modified using incoming information about learning processes described by other agents (this includes the acquisition of new learning data from the environment as a special case).",
                "In the most general case, we can specify this in terms of the potential modifications to the existing information about learning histories that can be performed using new information.",
                "For ease of presentation, we will assume that agents are stationary learning processes that can only record the previously executed learning step and only exchange information about this one individual learning step (our model can be easily extended to cater for more complex settings).",

                "In this matrix, each entry specifies a family of integration functions pc→c 1 , . . . , pc→c kc→c where c, c ∈ {D, H, f, g, h} and which define how agent js component cj will be modified using the information ci provided about (the same or a different component of) is learning step by applying pc→c r (ci, cj) for some r ∈ {1, . . . , kc→c }.",
                "To put it more simply, the collections of p-functions an agent j uses specifies how it will modify its own learning behaviour using information obtained from i.",
                "For the diagonal of this matrix, which contains the most common ways of integrating new information in ones own learning model, obvious ways of modifying ones own learning process include replacing cj by ci or ignoring ci altogether.",
                "More complex/subtle forms of learning process integration include: • Modification of Dj: append Di to Dj; filter out all elements from Dj which also appear in Di; append Di to Dj discarding all elements with attributes outside ranges which affect gj, or those elements already correctly classified by hj; • Modification of Hi: use the union/intersection of Hi and Hj; alternatively, discard elements of Hj that are inconsistent with Dj in the process of intersection or union, or filter out elements that cannot be obtained using fj (unless fj is modified at the same time) • Modification of fj: modify parameters or background knowledge of fj using information about fi; assess their relevance by simulating previous learning steps on Dj using gj and discard those that do not help improve own performance • Modification of hj: combine hj with hi using (say) logical or mathematical operators; make the use of hi contingent on a pre-integration assessment of its quality using own data Dj and gj While this list does not include fully fledged, concrete integration operations for learning processes, it is indicative of the broad range of interactions between individual agents learning processes that our framework enables.",
                "Note that the list does not include any modifications to gj.",
                "This is because we do not allow modifications to the agents own quality measure as this would render the model of rational (learning) action useless (if the quality measure is relative and volatile, we cannot objectively judge learning performance).",
                "Also note that some of the above examples require consulting other elements of lj than those appearing as arguments of the p-operations; we omit these for ease of notation, but emphasise that information-rich operations will involve consulting many different aspects of lj.",
                "Apart from operations along the diagonal of the matrix, more exotic integration operations are conceivable that combine information about different components.",
                "In theory we could fill most of the matrix with entries for them, but for lack of space we list only a few examples: • Modification of Dj using fi: pre-process samples in fi, e.g. to achieve intermediate representations that fj can be applied to • Modification of Dj using hi: filter out samples from Dj that are covered by hi and build hj using fj only on remaining samples • Modification of Hj using fi: filter out hypotheses from Hj that are not realisable using fi • Modification of hj using gi: if hj is composed of several sub-components, filter out those sub-components that do not perform well according to gi • . . .",

                "To support this automated pre-processing task, software used by these agencies applies clustering methods in order to identify outliers and flag those as potentially suspicious entities to the human user.",

                "Considering that this is the reality of the domain in the real world, it is easy to see that a framework like the one we have suggested above might be useful to exploit the cooperation potential that is not exploited by current systems. 3.2 Agent-based distributed learning system design To describe a concrete design for the AIS domain, we need to specify the following elements of the overall system: 1.",

                "Learning samples are represented by tuples containing data about individual vessels in terms of attributes A = {1, . . . , n} including things such as width, length, etc. with real-valued domains ([Ai] = R for all i).",
                "In terms of learning algorithm, we consider clustering with a fixed number of k clusters using the k-means and k-medoids clustering algorithms [5] (fixed meaning that the learning algorithm will always output k clusters; however, we allow agents to change the value of k over different learning cycles).",
                "This means that the hypothesis space can be defined as H = { c1, . . . , ck |ci ∈ R|A| } i.e. the set of all possible sets of k cluster centroids in |A|-dimensional Euclidean space.",
                "For each hypothesis h = c1, . . . , ck and any data point d ∈ ×n i=1[Ai] given domain [Ai] for the ith attribute of each sample, the assignment to clusters is given by C( c1, . . . , ck , d) = arg min 1≤j≤k |d − cj| i.e. d is assigned to that cluster whose centroid is closest to the data point in terms of Euclidean distance.",
                "For evaluation purposes, each dataset pertaining to a particular agent i is initially split into a training set Di and a validation Vi.",
                "Then, we generate a set of fake vessels Fi such that |Fi| = |Vi|.",

                "For this, we assign a confidence value r(h, d) to every ship d: r(h, d) = 1 |d − cC(h,d)| where C(h, d) is the index of the nearest centroid.",
                "Based on this measure, we classify any vessel in Fi ∪ Vi as fake if its r-value is below the median of all the confidences r(h, d) for d ∈ Fi ∪ Vi.",
                "With this, we can compute the quality gi(h) ∈ R as the ratio between all correctly classified vessels and all vessels in Fi ∪ Vi.",
                "As concerns 2., we use a simple Contract-Net Protocol (CNP) [20] based hypothesis trading mechanism: Before each learning iteration, agents issue (publicly broadcasted) Calls-For-Proposals (CfPs), advertising their own numerical model quality.",
                "In other words, the initiator of a CNP describes its own current learning state as (∗, ∗, ∗, gi(h), ∗) where h is their current hypothesis/model.",

                "To describe what is necessary for 3., we have to specify (i) under which conditions agents submit bids in response to a CfP, (ii) when they accept bids in the CNP negotiation process, and (iii) how they integrate the received information in their own learning process.",
                "Concerning (i) and (ii), we employ a very simple rule that is identical in both cases: let g be ones own model quality and g that advertised by the CfP (or highest bid, respectively).",
                "If g > g we respond to the CfP (accept the bid), else respond to the CfP (accept the bid) with probability P(g /g) and ignore (reject) it else.",

                "In our experiments, g and g are calculated by an additional agent that acts as a global validation mechanism for all agents (in a more realistic setting a comparison mechanism for different g functions would have to be provided).",
                "As for (iii), each agent uses a single model merging operator taken from the following two classes of operators (hj is the receivers own model and hi is the providers model): • ph→h (hi, hj) : - m-join: The m best clusters (in terms of coverage of Dj) from hypothesis hi are appended to hj. - m-select: The set of the m best clusters (in terms of coverage of Dj) from the union hi ∪hj is chosen as a new model. (Unlike m-join this method does not prefer own clusters over others.) • ph→D (hi, Dj) : - m-filter: The m best clusters (as above) from hi are identified and appended to a new model formed by using those samples not covered by these clusters applying the own learning algorithm fj.",

                "To generate sufficiently realistic properties for fake ships, their individual attribute values are taken from randomly selected ships in the validation set (so that each fake sample is a combination of attribute values of several existing ships).",

                "As can be seen from the performance plots in Figure 3 (homogeneous case) and 4 (heterogeneous case, two agents use the same method and one agent uses the other) this is clearly the case for the (unrestricted) join and filter integration operations (m = k) in both cases.",
                "This is quite natural, as these operations amount to sharing all available model knowledge among agents (under appropriate constraints depending on how beneficial the exchange seems to the agents).",

                "This suggests that heterogeneous learners are able to benefit even from rather limited knowledge sharing (and this is what using a rather small m = 3 amounts to given that k = 10) while this is not always true for homogeneous agents.",
                "This nicely illustrates how different learning or data mining algorithms can specialise on different parts of the problem space and then integrate their local results to achieve better individual performance.",
                "Apart from these obvious performance benefits, integrating partial learning results can also have other advantages: The m-filter operation, for example, decreases the number of learning samples and thus can speed up the learning process.",

                "RELATED WORK We have already mentioned work on distributed (nonagent) machine learning and data mining in the introductory chapter, so in this section we shall restrict ourselves to approaches that are more closely related to our outlook on distributed learning systems.",

                "A typical example for this type of system is the one suggested by Caragea et al. [6] which is based on a distributed support-vector machine approach where agents incrementally join their datasets together according to a fixed distributed algorithm.",
                "A similar example is the work of Weiss [24], where groups of classifier agents learn to organise their activity so as to optimise global system behaviour.",
                "The difference between this kind of collaborative agentbased learning systems [16] and our own framework is that these approaches assume a joint learning goal that is pursued collaboratively by all agents.",
                "Many approaches rely heavily on a homogeneity assumption: Plaza and Ontanon [15] suggest methods for agentbased intelligent reuse of cases in case-based reasoning but is only applicable to societies of homogeneous learners (and coined towards a specific learning method).",
                "An agentbased method for integrating distributed cluster analysis processes using density estimation is presented by Klusch et al. [13] which is also specifically designed for a particular learning algorithm.",
                "The same is true of [22, 23] which both present market-based mechanisms for aggregating the output of multiple learning agents, even though these approaches consider more interesting interaction mechanisms among learners.",
                "A number of approaches for sharing learning data [18] have also been proposed: Grecu and Becker [12] suggest an exchange of learning samples among agents, and Ghosh et al. [11] is a step in the right direction in terms of revealing only partial information about ones learning process as it deals with limited information sharing in distributed clustering.",
                "Papyrus [3] is a system that provides a markup language for meta-description of data, hypotheses and intermediate results and allows for an exchange of all this information among different nodes, however with a strictly cooperative goal of distributing the load for massively distributed data mining tasks.",
                "The MALE system [19] was a very early multiagent learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses.",
                "Agents were able to critique each others hypotheses until agreement was reached.",

                "To illustrate that the abstract principles of our architecture can be turned into concrete, computational systems, we described a market-based distributed clustering system which was evaluated in the domain of vessel tracking for purposes of identifying deviant or suspicious behaviour.",
                "Although our experimental results only hint at the potential of using our architecture, they underline that what we are proposing is feasible in principle and can have beneficial effects even in its most simple instantiation.",
                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",
                "These issues, together with a more systematic and thorough investigation of advanced interaction and communication mechanisms for distributed, collaborating and competing agents will be the subject of our future work on the subject.",

                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",

                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",

                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",

                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",

                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",

                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",

                "As can be seen from the performance plots in Figure 3 (homogeneous case) and 4 (heterogeneous case, two agents use the same method and one agent uses the other) this is clearly the case for the (unrestricted) join and filter integration operations (m = k) in both cases.",
                "This is quite natural, as these operations amount to sharing all available model knowledge among agents (under appropriate constraints depending on how beneficial the exchange seems to the agents).",
                "We can see that the quality of these operations is very close to the Single Agent that has access to all training data.",
                "For the restricted (m < k) m-join, m-filter and m-select methods we can also observe an interesting distinction, The Sixth Intl.",

                "This suggests that heterogeneous learners are able to benefit even from rather limited knowledge sharing (and this is what using a rather small m = 3 amounts to given that k = 10) while this is not always true for homogeneous agents.",
                "This nicely illustrates how different learning or data mining algorithms can specialise on different parts of the problem space and then integrate their local results to achieve better individual performance.",
                "Apart from these obvious performance benefits, integrating partial learning results can also have other advantages: The m-filter operation, for example, decreases the number of learning samples and thus can speed up the learning process.",

                "RELATED WORK We have already mentioned work on distributed (nonagent) machine learning and data mining in the introductory chapter, so in this section we shall restrict ourselves to approaches that are more closely related to our outlook on distributed learning systems.",
                "Very often, approaches that are allegedly agent-based completely disregard agent autonomy and prescribe local decision-making procedures a priori.",
                "A typical example for this type of system is the one suggested by Caragea et al. [6] which is based on a distributed support-vector machine approach where agents incrementally join their datasets together according to a fixed distributed algorithm.",
                "A similar example is the work of Weiss [24], where groups of classifier agents learn to organise their activity so as to optimise global system behaviour.",
                "The difference between this kind of collaborative agentbased learning systems [16] and our own framework is that these approaches assume a joint learning goal that is pursued collaboratively by all agents.",
                "Many approaches rely heavily on a homogeneity assumption: Plaza and Ontanon [15] suggest methods for agentbased intelligent reuse of cases in case-based reasoning but is only applicable to societies of homogeneous learners (and coined towards a specific learning method).",
                "An agentbased method for integrating distributed cluster analysis processes using density estimation is presented by Klusch et al. [13] which is also specifically designed for a particular learning algorithm.",
                "The same is true of [22, 23] which both present market-based mechanisms for aggregating the output of multiple learning agents, even though these approaches consider more interesting interaction mechanisms among learners.",
                "A number of approaches for sharing learning data [18] have also been proposed: Grecu and Becker [12] suggest an exchange of learning samples among agents, and Ghosh et al. [11] is a step in the right direction in terms of revealing only partial information about ones learning process as it deals with limited information sharing in distributed clustering.",
                "Papyrus [3] is a system that provides a markup language for meta-description of data, hypotheses and intermediate results and allows for an exchange of all this information among different nodes, however with a strictly cooperative goal of distributing the load for massively distributed data mining tasks.",
                "The MALE system [19] was a very early multiagent learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses.",
                "Agents were able to critique each others hypotheses until agreement was reached.",
                "However, all agents in this system were identical and the system was strictly cooperative.",
                "The ANIMALS system [10] was used to simulate multistrategy learning by combining two or more learning techniques (represented by heterogeneous agents) in order to overcome weaknesses in the individual algorithms, yet it was also a strictly cooperative system.",
                "As these examples show and to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to provide a framework that can accommodate both independent and heterogeneous learning agents and this can be regarded as the main contribution of our work. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION In this paper, we outlined a generic, abstract framework for distributed machine learning and data mining.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) to capture complex forms of interaction between heterogeneous and/or self-interested learners in an architecture that can be used as the foundation for implementing systems that use complex interaction and reasoning mechanisms to enable agents to inform and improve their learning abilities with information provided by other learners in the system, provided that all agents engage in a sufficiently similar learning activity.",
                "To illustrate that the abstract principles of our architecture can be turned into concrete, computational systems, we described a market-based distributed clustering system which was evaluated in the domain of vessel tracking for purposes of identifying deviant or suspicious behaviour.",
                "Although our experimental results only hint at the potential of using our architecture, they underline that what we are proposing is feasible in principle and can have beneficial effects even in its most simple instantiation.",
                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",
                "These issues, together with a more systematic and thorough investigation of advanced interaction and communication mechanisms for distributed, collaborating and competing agents will be the subject of our future work on the subject.",

                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",

                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",

                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",

                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",

                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",

                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
                "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
                "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
                "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
                "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

                "This is too abstract and unspecific for our purposes: While it describes what agents should do (transform the settings for the next learning step in an optimal way), it doesnt specify how this can be achieved in practice. 2.2 Integrating learning process information To specify how an agents learning process can be affected by integrating information received from others, we need to flesh out the details of how the learning steps it will perform can be modified using incoming information about learning processes described by other agents (this includes the acquisition of new learning data from the environment as a special case).",
                "In the most general case, we can specify this in terms of the potential modifications to the existing information about learning histories that can be performed using new information.",
                "For ease of presentation, we will assume that agents are stationary learning processes that can only record the previously executed learning step and only exchange information about this one individual learning step (our model can be easily extended to cater for more complex settings).",

                "In this matrix, each entry specifies a family of integration functions pc→c 1 , . . . , pc→c kc→c where c, c ∈ {D, H, f, g, h} and which define how agent js component cj will be modified using the information ci provided about (the same or a different component of) is learning step by applying pc→c r (ci, cj) for some r ∈ {1, . . . , kc→c }.",
                "To put it more simply, the collections of p-functions an agent j uses specifies how it will modify its own learning behaviour using information obtained from i.",
                "For the diagonal of this matrix, which contains the most common ways of integrating new information in ones own learning model, obvious ways of modifying ones own learning process include replacing cj by ci or ignoring ci altogether.",
                "More complex/subtle forms of learning process integration include: • Modification of Dj: append Di to Dj; filter out all elements from Dj which also appear in Di; append Di to Dj discarding all elements with attributes outside ranges which affect gj, or those elements already correctly classified by hj; • Modification of Hi: use the union/intersection of Hi and Hj; alternatively, discard elements of Hj that are inconsistent with Dj in the process of intersection or union, or filter out elements that cannot be obtained using fj (unless fj is modified at the same time) • Modification of fj: modify parameters or background knowledge of fj using information about fi; assess their relevance by simulating previous learning steps on Dj using gj and discard those that do not help improve own performance • Modification of hj: combine hj with hi using (say) logical or mathematical operators; make the use of hi contingent on a pre-integration assessment of its quality using own data Dj and gj While this list does not include fully fledged, concrete integration operations for learning processes, it is indicative of the broad range of interactions between individual agents learning processes that our framework enables.",
                "Note that the list does not include any modifications to gj.",

                "To illustrate that the abstract principles of our architecture can be turned into concrete, computational systems, we described a market-based distributed clustering system which was evaluated in the domain of vessel tracking for purposes of identifying deviant or suspicious behaviour.",
                "Although our experimental results only hint at the potential of using our architecture, they underline that what we are proposing is feasible in principle and can have beneficial effects even in its most simple instantiation.",
                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",

                "We present an abstract architecture that enables agents to exchange models of their local learning processes and introduces a number of different methods for integrating these processes.",
                "This allows us to apply existing agent interaction mechanisms to distributed machine learning tasks, thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available in agent-based computing, and enables agents to engage in meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions.",
                "We apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which different learners may be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning algorithms.",
                "We report on experimental results obtained using this system, review related work on the subject, and discuss potential future extensions to the framework.",
                "General Terms Theory Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Multiagent Systems 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 679 training function ht performance measure solution quality qtgtft training set Dt hypothesis hypothesis ht−1 Figure 1: A generic model of a learning step i.e. the only requirement the transition relation →⊆ L × L makes is that the new hypothesis is the result of training the old hypothesis on all available sample data that belongs to the current step.",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
                "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
                "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
                "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
                "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

                "This is too abstract and unspecific for our purposes: While it describes what agents should do (transform the settings for the next learning step in an optimal way), it doesnt specify how this can be achieved in practice. 2.2 Integrating learning process information To specify how an agents learning process can be affected by integrating information received from others, we need to flesh out the details of how the learning steps it will perform can be modified using incoming information about learning processes described by other agents (this includes the acquisition of new learning data from the environment as a special case).",
                "In the most general case, we can specify this in terms of the potential modifications to the existing information about learning histories that can be performed using new information.",
                "For ease of presentation, we will assume that agents are stationary learning processes that can only record the previously executed learning step and only exchange information about this one individual learning step (our model can be easily extended to cater for more complex settings).",

                "Considering all possible interactions at an abstract level, we basically obtain a matrix of possibilities for modifications of js learning step specification as shown in Table 1.",
                "In this matrix, each entry specifies a family of integration functions pc→c 1 , . . . , pc→c kc→c where c, c ∈ {D, H, f, g, h} and which define how agent js component cj will be modified using the information ci provided about (the same or a different component of) is learning step by applying pc→c r (ci, cj) for some r ∈ {1, . . . , kc→c }.",
                "To put it more simply, the collections of p-functions an agent j uses specifies how it will modify its own learning behaviour using information obtained from i.",
                "For the diagonal of this matrix, which contains the most common ways of integrating new information in ones own learning model, obvious ways of modifying ones own learning process include replacing cj by ci or ignoring ci altogether.",
                "More complex/subtle forms of learning process integration include: • Modification of Dj: append Di to Dj; filter out all elements from Dj which also appear in Di; append Di to Dj discarding all elements with attributes outside ranges which affect gj, or those elements already correctly classified by hj; • Modification of Hi: use the union/intersection of Hi and Hj; alternatively, discard elements of Hj that are inconsistent with Dj in the process of intersection or union, or filter out elements that cannot be obtained using fj (unless fj is modified at the same time) • Modification of fj: modify parameters or background knowledge of fj using information about fi; assess their relevance by simulating previous learning steps on Dj using gj and discard those that do not help improve own performance • Modification of hj: combine hj with hi using (say) logical or mathematical operators; make the use of hi contingent on a pre-integration assessment of its quality using own data Dj and gj While this list does not include fully fledged, concrete integration operations for learning processes, it is indicative of the broad range of interactions between individual agents learning processes that our framework enables.",
                "Note that the list does not include any modifications to gj.",
                "This is because we do not allow modifications to the agents own quality measure as this would render the model of rational (learning) action useless (if the quality measure is relative and volatile, we cannot objectively judge learning performance).",
                "Also note that some of the above examples require consulting other elements of lj than those appearing as arguments of the p-operations; we omit these for ease of notation, but emphasise that information-rich operations will involve consulting many different aspects of lj.",
                "Apart from operations along the diagonal of the matrix, more exotic integration operations are conceivable that combine information about different components.",
                "In theory we could fill most of the matrix with entries for them, but for lack of space we list only a few examples: • Modification of Dj using fi: pre-process samples in fi, e.g. to achieve intermediate representations that fj can be applied to • Modification of Dj using hi: filter out samples from Dj that are covered by hi and build hj using fj only on remaining samples • Modification of Hj using fi: filter out hypotheses from Hj that are not realisable using fi • Modification of hj using gi: if hj is composed of several sub-components, filter out those sub-components that do not perform well according to gi • . . .",
                "Finally, many messages received from others describing properties of their learning processes will contain information about several elements of a learning step, giving rise to yet more complex operations that depend on which kinds of information are available.",

                "While the reasons for such unusual behaviour may range from pure coincidence or technical problems to criminal activity (such as smuggling, piracy, terrorist/military attacks) it is obviously useful to pre-process the huge amount of vessel (tracking) data that is available before engaging in further analysis by human experts.",

                "In section 4 we analyse the performance of each of these two classes for different choices of m. It is noteworthy that this agent-based distributed data mining system is one of the simplest conceivable instances of our abstract architecture.",
                "While we have previously applied it also to a more complex market-based architecture using Inductive Logic Programming learners in a transport logistics domain [22], we believe that the system described here is complex enough to illustrate the key design decisions involved in using our framework and provides simple example solutions for these design issues. 4.",

                "To generate sufficiently realistic properties for fake ships, their individual attribute values are taken from randomly selected ships in the validation set (so that each fake sample is a combination of attribute values of several existing ships).",
                "In these experiments, we are mainly interested in investigating whether a simple form of knowledge sharing between self-interested learning agents could improve agent performance compared to a setting of isolated learners.",
                "Thereby, we distinguish between homogeneous learner societies where all agents use the same clustering algorithm and heterogeneous ones where different agents use different algorithms.",
                "As can be seen from the performance plots in Figure 3 (homogeneous case) and 4 (heterogeneous case, two agents use the same method and one agent uses the other) this is clearly the case for the (unrestricted) join and filter integration operations (m = k) in both cases.",
                "This is quite natural, as these operations amount to sharing all available model knowledge among agents (under appropriate constraints depending on how beneficial the exchange seems to the agents).",

                "This suggests that heterogeneous learners are able to benefit even from rather limited knowledge sharing (and this is what using a rather small m = 3 amounts to given that k = 10) while this is not always true for homogeneous agents.",
                "This nicely illustrates how different learning or data mining algorithms can specialise on different parts of the problem space and then integrate their local results to achieve better individual performance.",

                "RELATED WORK We have already mentioned work on distributed (nonagent) machine learning and data mining in the introductory chapter, so in this section we shall restrict ourselves to approaches that are more closely related to our outlook on distributed learning systems.",
                "Very often, approaches that are allegedly agent-based completely disregard agent autonomy and prescribe local decision-making procedures a priori.",
                "A typical example for this type of system is the one suggested by Caragea et al. [6] which is based on a distributed support-vector machine approach where agents incrementally join their datasets together according to a fixed distributed algorithm.",

                "An agentbased method for integrating distributed cluster analysis processes using density estimation is presented by Klusch et al. [13] which is also specifically designed for a particular learning algorithm.",
                "The same is true of [22, 23] which both present market-based mechanisms for aggregating the output of multiple learning agents, even though these approaches consider more interesting interaction mechanisms among learners.",
                "A number of approaches for sharing learning data [18] have also been proposed: Grecu and Becker [12] suggest an exchange of learning samples among agents, and Ghosh et al. [11] is a step in the right direction in terms of revealing only partial information about ones learning process as it deals with limited information sharing in distributed clustering.",
                "Papyrus [3] is a system that provides a markup language for meta-description of data, hypotheses and intermediate results and allows for an exchange of all this information among different nodes, however with a strictly cooperative goal of distributing the load for massively distributed data mining tasks.",
                "The MALE system [19] was a very early multiagent learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses.",
                "Agents were able to critique each others hypotheses until agreement was reached.",
                "However, all agents in this system were identical and the system was strictly cooperative.",
                "The ANIMALS system [10] was used to simulate multistrategy learning by combining two or more learning techniques (represented by heterogeneous agents) in order to overcome weaknesses in the individual algorithms, yet it was also a strictly cooperative system.",
                "As these examples show and to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to provide a framework that can accommodate both independent and heterogeneous learning agents and this can be regarded as the main contribution of our work. 6.",

                "To illustrate that the abstract principles of our architecture can be turned into concrete, computational systems, we described a market-based distributed clustering system which was evaluated in the domain of vessel tracking for purposes of identifying deviant or suspicious behaviour.",
                "Although our experimental results only hint at the potential of using our architecture, they underline that what we are proposing is feasible in principle and can have beneficial effects even in its most simple instantiation.",
                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",

                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",

                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",
                "These issues, together with a more systematic and thorough investigation of advanced interaction and communication mechanisms for distributed, collaborating and competing agents will be the subject of our future work on the subject.",

                "We apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which different learners may be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning algorithms.",

                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",

                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
                "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
                "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
                "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
                "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

                "In the most general case, we can specify this in terms of the potential modifications to the existing information about learning histories that can be performed using new information.",
                "For ease of presentation, we will assume that agents are stationary learning processes that can only record the previously executed learning step and only exchange information about this one individual learning step (our model can be easily extended to cater for more complex settings).",

                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",

                "We present an abstract architecture that enables agents to exchange models of their local learning processes and introduces a number of different methods for integrating these processes.",
                "This allows us to apply existing agent interaction mechanisms to distributed machine learning tasks, thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available in agent-based computing, and enables agents to engage in meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions.",
                "We apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which different learners may be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning algorithms.",
                "We report on experimental results obtained using this system, review related work on the subject, and discuss potential future extensions to the framework.",
                "General Terms Theory Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Multiagent Systems 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or <br>consensusbased method</br>s for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",

                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
                "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
                "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
                "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
                "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

                "In the most general case, we can specify this in terms of the potential modifications to the existing information about learning histories that can be performed using new information.",
                "For ease of presentation, we will assume that agents are stationary learning processes that can only record the previously executed learning step and only exchange information about this one individual learning step (our model can be easily extended to cater for more complex settings).",

                "To put it more simply, the collections of p-functions an agent j uses specifies how it will modify its own learning behaviour using information obtained from i.",
                "For the diagonal of this matrix, which contains the most common ways of integrating new information in ones own learning model, obvious ways of modifying ones own learning process include replacing cj by ci or ignoring ci altogether.",
                "More complex/subtle forms of learning process integration include: • Modification of Dj: append Di to Dj; filter out all elements from Dj which also appear in Di; append Di to Dj discarding all elements with attributes outside ranges which affect gj, or those elements already correctly classified by hj; • Modification of Hi: use the union/intersection of Hi and Hj; alternatively, discard elements of Hj that are inconsistent with Dj in the process of intersection or union, or filter out elements that cannot be obtained using fj (unless fj is modified at the same time) • Modification of fj: modify parameters or background knowledge of fj using information about fi; assess their relevance by simulating previous learning steps on Dj using gj and discard those that do not help improve own performance • Modification of hj: combine hj with hi using (say) logical or mathematical operators; make the use of hi contingent on a pre-integration assessment of its quality using own data Dj and gj While this list does not include fully fledged, concrete integration operations for learning processes, it is indicative of the broad range of interactions between individual agents learning processes that our framework enables.",
                "Note that the list does not include any modifications to gj.",
                "This is because we do not allow modifications to the agents own quality measure as this would render the model of rational (learning) action useless (if the quality measure is relative and volatile, we cannot objectively judge learning performance).",
                "Also note that some of the above examples require consulting other elements of lj than those appearing as arguments of the p-operations; we omit these for ease of notation, but emphasise that information-rich operations will involve consulting many different aspects of lj.",
                "Apart from operations along the diagonal of the matrix, more exotic integration operations are conceivable that combine information about different components.",
                "In theory we could fill most of the matrix with entries for them, but for lack of space we list only a few examples: • Modification of Dj using fi: pre-process samples in fi, e.g. to achieve intermediate representations that fj can be applied to • Modification of Dj using hi: filter out samples from Dj that are covered by hi and build hj using fj only on remaining samples • Modification of Hj using fi: filter out hypotheses from Hj that are not realisable using fi • Modification of hj using gi: if hj is composed of several sub-components, filter out those sub-components that do not perform well according to gi • . . .",

                "While the reasons for such unusual behaviour may range from pure coincidence or technical problems to criminal activity (such as smuggling, piracy, terrorist/military attacks) it is obviously useful to pre-process the huge amount of vessel (tracking) data that is available before engaging in further analysis by human experts.",

(Unlike m-join this method does not prefer own clusters over others.) • ph→D (hi, Dj) : - m-filter: The m best clusters (as above) from hi are identified and appended to a new model formed by using those samples not covered by these clusters applying the own learning algorithm fj.",

                "Papyrus [3] is a system that provides a markup language for meta-description of data, hypotheses and intermediate results and allows for an exchange of all this information among different nodes, however with a strictly cooperative goal of distributing the load for massively distributed data mining tasks.",

                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",

                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) <br>communication and coordination</br> offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",

                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",

                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",

                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",

                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective <br>autonomous learning agent</br>s.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",

                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
                "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
                "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
                "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
                "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",

                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",

                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",

                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
                "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
                "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
                "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
                "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

                "In the most general case, we can specify this in terms of the potential modifications to the existing information about learning histories that can be performed using new information.",
                "For ease of presentation, we will assume that agents are stationary learning processes that can only record the previously executed learning step and only exchange information about this one individual learning step (our model can be easily extended to cater for more complex settings).",

                "Note that the list does not include any modifications to gj.",
                "This is because we do not allow modifications to the agents own quality measure as this would render the model of rational (learning) action useless (if the quality measure is relative and volatile, we cannot objectively judge learning performance).",
                "Also note that some of the above examples require consulting other elements of lj than those appearing as arguments of the p-operations; we omit these for ease of notation, but emphasise that information-rich operations will involve consulting many different aspects of lj.",
                "Apart from operations along the diagonal of the matrix, more exotic integration operations are conceivable that combine information about different components.",
                "In theory we could fill most of the matrix with entries for them, but for lack of space we list only a few examples: • Modification of Dj using fi: pre-process samples in fi, e.g. to achieve intermediate representations that fj can be applied to • Modification of Dj using hi: filter out samples from Dj that are covered by hi and build hj using fj only on remaining samples • Modification of Hj using fi: filter out hypotheses from Hj that are not realisable using fi • Modification of hj using gi: if hj is composed of several sub-components, filter out those sub-components that do not perform well according to gi • . . .",

                "To describe what is necessary for 3., we have to specify (i) under which conditions agents submit bids in response to a CfP, (ii) when they accept bids in the CNP negotiation process, and (iii) how they integrate the received information in their own learning process.",
                "Concerning (i) and (ii), we employ a very simple rule that is identical in both cases: let g be ones own model quality and g that advertised by the CfP (or highest bid, respectively).",

                "In our experiments, g and g are calculated by an additional agent that acts as a global validation mechanism for all agents (in a more realistic setting a comparison mechanism for different g functions would have to be provided).",
                "As for (iii), each agent uses a single model merging operator taken from the following two classes of operators (hj is the receivers own model and hi is the providers model): • ph→h (hi, hj) : - m-join: The m best clusters (in terms of coverage of Dj) from hypothesis hi are appended to hj. - m-select: The set of the m best clusters (in terms of coverage of Dj) from the union hi ∪hj is chosen as a new model. (Unlike m-join this method does not prefer own clusters over others.) • ph→D (hi, Dj) : - m-filter: The m best clusters (as above) from hi are identified and appended to a new model formed by using those samples not covered by these clusters applying the own learning algorithm fj.",

                "Thereby, we distinguish between homogeneous learner societies where all agents use the same clustering algorithm and heterogeneous ones where different agents use different algorithms.",
                "As can be seen from the performance plots in Figure 3 (homogeneous case) and 4 (heterogeneous case, two agents use the same method and one agent uses the other) this is clearly the case for the (unrestricted) join and filter integration operations (m = k) in both cases.",
                "This is quite natural, as these operations amount to sharing all available model knowledge among agents (under appropriate constraints depending on how beneficial the exchange seems to the agents).",

                "This suggests that heterogeneous learners are able to benefit even from rather limited knowledge sharing (and this is what using a rather small m = 3 amounts to given that k = 10) while this is not always true for homogeneous agents.",
                "This nicely illustrates how different learning or data mining algorithms can specialise on different parts of the problem space and then integrate their local results to achieve better individual performance.",
                "Apart from these obvious performance benefits, integrating partial learning results can also have other advantages: The m-filter operation, for example, decreases the number of learning samples and thus can speed up the learning process.",

                "RELATED WORK We have already mentioned work on distributed (nonagent) machine learning and data mining in the introductory chapter, so in this section we shall restrict ourselves to approaches that are more closely related to our outlook on distributed learning systems.",
                "Very often, approaches that are allegedly agent-based completely disregard agent autonomy and prescribe local decision-making procedures a priori.",
                "A typical example for this type of system is the one suggested by Caragea et al. [6] which is based on a distributed support-vector machine approach where agents incrementally join their datasets together according to a fixed distributed algorithm.",
                "A similar example is the work of Weiss [24], where groups of classifier agents learn to organise their activity so as to optimise global system behaviour.",
                "The difference between this kind of collaborative agentbased learning systems [16] and our own framework is that these approaches assume a joint learning goal that is pursued collaboratively by all agents.",

                "An agentbased method for integrating distributed cluster analysis processes using density estimation is presented by Klusch et al. [13] which is also specifically designed for a particular learning algorithm.",
                "The same is true of [22, 23] which both present market-based mechanisms for aggregating the output of multiple learning agents, even though these approaches consider more interesting interaction mechanisms among learners.",
                "A number of approaches for sharing learning data [18] have also been proposed: Grecu and Becker [12] suggest an exchange of learning samples among agents, and Ghosh et al. [11] is a step in the right direction in terms of revealing only partial information about ones learning process as it deals with limited information sharing in distributed clustering.",
                "Papyrus [3] is a system that provides a markup language for meta-description of data, hypotheses and intermediate results and allows for an exchange of all this information among different nodes, however with a strictly cooperative goal of distributing the load for massively distributed data mining tasks.",
                "The MALE system [19] was a very early multiagent learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses.",
                "Agents were able to critique each others hypotheses until agreement was reached.",
                "However, all agents in this system were identical and the system was strictly cooperative.",
                "The ANIMALS system [10] was used to simulate multistrategy learning by combining two or more learning techniques (represented by heterogeneous agents) in order to overcome weaknesses in the individual algorithms, yet it was also a strictly cooperative system.",
                "As these examples show and to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to provide a framework that can accommodate both independent and heterogeneous learning agents and this can be regarded as the main contribution of our work. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION In this paper, we outlined a generic, abstract framework for distributed machine learning and data mining.",

                "To illustrate that the abstract principles of our architecture can be turned into concrete, computational systems, we described a market-based distributed clustering system which was evaluated in the domain of vessel tracking for purposes of identifying deviant or suspicious behaviour.",
                "Although our experimental results only hint at the potential of using our architecture, they underline that what we are proposing is feasible in principle and can have beneficial effects even in its most simple instantiation.",
                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",
                "These issues, together with a more systematic and thorough investigation of advanced interaction and communication mechanisms for distributed, collaborating and competing agents will be the subject of our future work on the subject.",

                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",

                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",

                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
                "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
                "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
                "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
                "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from <br>multiagent learn</br>ing systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",

                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",

                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",

                "This allows us to apply existing agent interaction mechanisms to distributed machine learning tasks, thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available in agent-based computing, and enables agents to engage in meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions.",
                "We apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which different learners may be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning algorithms.",
                "We report on experimental results obtained using this system, review related work on the subject, and discuss potential future extensions to the framework.",
                "General Terms Theory Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Multiagent Systems 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In the areas of machine learning and data mining (cf. [14, 17] for overviews), it has long been recognised that parallelisation and distribution can be used to improve learning performance.",
                "Various techniques have been suggested in this respect, ranging from the low-level integration of independently derived learning hypotheses (e.g. combining different classifiers to make optimal classification decisions [4, 7], model averaging of Bayesian classifiers [8], or consensusbased methods for integrating different clusterings [11]), to the high-level combination of learning results obtained by heterogeneous learning agents using meta-learning (e.g. [3, 10, 21]).",
                "All of these approaches assume homogeneity of agent design (all agents apply the same learning algorithm) and/or agent objectives (all agents are trying to cooperatively solve a single, global learning problem).",
                "Therefore, the techniques they suggest are not applicable in societies of autonomous learners interacting in open systems.",
                "In such systems, learners (agents) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results (because of different data formats and representations, learning algorithms, or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [11]) and cannot always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion (discovered knowledge and collected data might be economic assets that should only be shared when this is deemed profitable; malicious agents might attempt to adversely influence others learning results, etc.).",
                "Examples for applications of this kind abound.",
                "Many distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g. exchange of patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) - however, they may permit the exchange of local learning hypotheses among different learners.",
                "In other areas, training data might be commercially valuable, so that agents would only make it available to others if those agents could provide something in return (e.g. in remote ship surveillance and tracking, where the different agencies involved are commercial service providers [1]).",
                "Furthermore, agents might have a vested interest in negatively affecting other agents learning performance.",
                "An example for this is that of fraudulent agents on eBay which may try to prevent reputationlearning agents from the construction of useful models for detecting fraud.",
                "Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and parallelisation in principle.",
                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",
                "Our hypothesis is a very simple one: If we can devise a sufficiently general, abstract view of describing learning processes, we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for (i) rational reasoning and (ii) communication and coordination offered by agent technology so as to build effective autonomous learning agents.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we introduce such an abstract architecture (section 2) and implement a simple, concrete instance of it in a real-world domain (section 3).",
                "We report on empirical results obtained with this implemented system that demonstrate the viability of our approach (section 4).",
                "Finally, we review related work (section 5) and conclude with a summary, discussion of our approach and outlook to future work on the subject (section 6). 2.",
                "ABSTRACT ARCHITECTURE Our framework is based on providing formal (meta-level) descriptions of learning processes, i.e. representations of all relevant components of the learning machinery used by a learning agent, together with information about the state of the learning process.",
                "To ensure that this framework is sufficiently general, we consider the following general description of a learning problem: Given data D ⊆ D taken from an instance space D, a hypothesis space H and an (unknown) target function c ∈ H1 , derive a function h ∈ H that approximates c as well as possible according to some performance measure g : H → Q where Q is a set of possible levels of learning performance. 1 By requiring this we are ensuring that the learning problem can be solved in principle using the given hypothesis space.",
                "This very broad definition includes a number of components of a learning problem for which more concrete specifications can be provided if we want to be more precise.",
                "For the cases of classification and clustering, for example, we can further specify the above as follows: Learning data can be described in both cases as D = ×n i=1[Ai] where [Ai] is the domain of the ith attribute and the set of attributes is A = {1, . . . , n}.",
                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",
                "In other words, one learning step always consists of applying the update function to all samples in D exactly once.",
                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",
                "We denote the set of all possible learning steps by L. For ease of notation, we denote the components of any l ∈ L by D(l), H(l), f(l) and g(l), respectively.",
                "The reason why such learning step specifications use a subset H of H instead of H itself is that learners often have explicit knowledge about which hypotheses are effectively ruled out by f given h in the future (if this is not the case, we can still set H = H).",
                "A learning process is a finite, non-empty sequence l = l1 → l2 → . . . → ln of learning steps such that ∀1 ≤ i < n .h(li+1) = f(li)(h(li), D(li)) The Sixth Intl.",

                "We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L (ignoring, for ease of notation, the fact that this set depends on H, D and the spaces of possible training and evaluation functions f and g).",
                "The performance trace associated with a learning process l is the sequence q1, . . . , qn ∈ Qn where qi = g(li)(h(li)), i.e. the sequence of quality values calculated by the performance measures of the individual learning steps on the respective hypotheses.",
                "Such specifications allow agents to provide a selfdescription of their learning process.",
                "However, in communication among learning agents, it is often useful to provide only partial information about ones internal learning process rather than its full details, e.g. when advertising this information in order to enter information exchange negotiations with others.",
                "For this purpose, we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes (in the sense of disjunctive choice) which we call learning process descriptions (LPDs) rather than by giving precise descriptions about a single, concrete learning process.",
                "This allows us to describe properties of a learning process without specifying its details exhaustively.",
                "As an example, the set {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) ≤ 100} describes all processes that have a training set of at most 100 samples (where all the other elements are arbitrary).",
                "Likewise, {l ∈ L|∀l = l[i].D(l) = {d}} is equivalent to just providing information about a single sample {d} and no other details about the process (this can be useful to model, for example, data received from the environment).",
                "Therefore, we use ℘(L), that is the set of all LPDs, as the basis for designing content languages for communication in the protocols we specify below.",
                "In practice, the actual content language chosen will of course be more restricted and allow only for a special type of subsets of L to be specified in a compact way, and its choice will be crucial for the interactions that can occur between learning agents.",
                "For our examples below, we simply assume explicit enumeration of all possible elements of the respective sets and function spaces (D, H, etc.) extended by the use of wildcard symbols ∗ (so that our second example above would become ({d}, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗)). 2.1 Learning agents In our framework, a learning agent is essentially a metareasoning function that operates on information about learning processes and is situated in an environment co-inhabited by other learning agents.",
                "This means that it is not only capable of meta-level control on how to learn, but in doing so it can take information into account that is provided by other agents or the environment.",
                "Although purely cooperative or hybrid cases are possible, for the purposes of this paper we will assume that agents are purely self-interested, and that while there may be a potential for cooperation considering how agents can mutually improve each others learning performance, there is no global mechanism that can enforce such cooperative behaviour.2 Formally speaking, an agents learning function is a function which, given a set of histories of previous learning processes (of oneself and potentially of learning processes about which other agents have provided information) and outputs a learning step which is its next learning action.",
                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",
                "Note that in λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) some elements li of the input learning process set may be descriptions of new learning data received from the environment.",
                "The λ-function can essentially be freely chosen by the agent as long as one requirement is met, namely that the learning data that is being used always stems from what has been previously observed.",
                "More formally, ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ „ D(l) ∪ [ l =li[j] D(l ) « ⊆ [ l =li[j] D(l ) i.e. whatever λ outputs as a new learning step and updated set of learning histories, it cannot invent new data; it has to work with the samples that have been made available to it earlier in the process through the environment or from other agents (and it can of course re-train on previously used data).",
                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",
                "One possibility of specifying this is to require that ∀{l1, . . . ln} ∈ ℘(L).λ({l1, . . . ln}) = (l, {l1, . . . ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e. the learning goal itself is not affected by agents behaviour in the environment. 680 The Sixth Intl.",

                "In the most general case, we can specify this in terms of the potential modifications to the existing information about learning histories that can be performed using new information.",
                "For ease of presentation, we will assume that agents are stationary learning processes that can only record the previously executed learning step and only exchange information about this one individual learning step (our model can be easily extended to cater for more complex settings).",

                "To put it more simply, the collections of p-functions an agent j uses specifies how it will modify its own learning behaviour using information obtained from i.",
                "For the diagonal of this matrix, which contains the most common ways of integrating new information in ones own learning model, obvious ways of modifying ones own learning process include replacing cj by ci or ignoring ci altogether.",
                "More complex/subtle forms of learning process integration include: • Modification of Dj: append Di to Dj; filter out all elements from Dj which also appear in Di; append Di to Dj discarding all elements with attributes outside ranges which affect gj, or those elements already correctly classified by hj; • Modification of Hi: use the union/intersection of Hi and Hj; alternatively, discard elements of Hj that are inconsistent with Dj in the process of intersection or union, or filter out elements that cannot be obtained using fj (unless fj is modified at the same time) • Modification of fj: modify parameters or background knowledge of fj using information about fi; assess their relevance by simulating previous learning steps on Dj using gj and discard those that do not help improve own performance • Modification of hj: combine hj with hi using (say) logical or mathematical operators; make the use of hi contingent on a pre-integration assessment of its quality using own data Dj and gj While this list does not include fully fledged, concrete integration operations for learning processes, it is indicative of the broad range of interactions between individual agents learning processes that our framework enables.",
                "Note that the list does not include any modifications to gj.",
                "This is because we do not allow modifications to the agents own quality measure as this would render the model of rational (learning) action useless (if the quality measure is relative and volatile, we cannot objectively judge learning performance).",
                "Also note that some of the above examples require consulting other elements of lj than those appearing as arguments of the p-operations; we omit these for ease of notation, but emphasise that information-rich operations will involve consulting many different aspects of lj.",
                "Apart from operations along the diagonal of the matrix, more exotic integration operations are conceivable that combine information about different components.",
                "In theory we could fill most of the matrix with entries for them, but for lack of space we list only a few examples: • Modification of Dj using fi: pre-process samples in fi, e.g. to achieve intermediate representations that fj can be applied to • Modification of Dj using hi: filter out samples from Dj that are covered by hi and build hj using fj only on remaining samples • Modification of Hj using fi: filter out hypotheses from Hj that are not realisable using fi • Modification of hj using gi: if hj is composed of several sub-components, filter out those sub-components that do not perform well according to gi • . . .",

                "However, many agencies active in this domain are competing enterprises and use their (partially overlapping, but distinct) datasets and learning hypotheses (models) as assets and hence cannot be expected to collaborate in a fully cooperative way to improve overall learning results.",
                "Considering that this is the reality of the domain in the real world, it is easy to see that a framework like the one we have suggested above might be useful to exploit the cooperation potential that is not exploited by current systems. 3.2 Agent-based distributed learning system design To describe a concrete design for the AIS domain, we need to specify the following elements of the overall system: 1.",

                "Learning samples are represented by tuples containing data about individual vessels in terms of attributes A = {1, . . . , n} including things such as width, length, etc. with real-valued domains ([Ai] = R for all i).",
                "In terms of learning algorithm, we consider clustering with a fixed number of k clusters using the k-means and k-medoids clustering algorithms [5] (fixed meaning that the learning algorithm will always output k clusters; however, we allow agents to change the value of k over different learning cycles).",
                "This means that the hypothesis space can be defined as H = { c1, . . . , ck |ci ∈ R|A| } i.e. the set of all possible sets of k cluster centroids in |A|-dimensional Euclidean space.",
                "For each hypothesis h = c1, . . . , ck and any data point d ∈ ×n i=1[Ai] given domain [Ai] for the ith attribute of each sample, the assignment to clusters is given by C( c1, . . . , ck , d) = arg min 1≤j≤k |d − cj| i.e. d is assigned to that cluster whose centroid is closest to the data point in terms of Euclidean distance.",
                "For evaluation purposes, each dataset pertaining to a particular agent i is initially split into a training set Di and a validation Vi.",
                "Then, we generate a set of fake vessels Fi such that |Fi| = |Vi|.",
                "These two sets assess the agents ability to detect suspicious vessels.",
                "For this, we assign a confidence value r(h, d) to every ship d: r(h, d) = 1 |d − cC(h,d)| where C(h, d) is the index of the nearest centroid.",
                "Based on this measure, we classify any vessel in Fi ∪ Vi as fake if its r-value is below the median of all the confidences r(h, d) for d ∈ Fi ∪ Vi.",

                "As concerns 2., we use a simple Contract-Net Protocol (CNP) [20] based hypothesis trading mechanism: Before each learning iteration, agents issue (publicly broadcasted) Calls-For-Proposals (CfPs), advertising their own numerical model quality.",
                "In other words, the initiator of a CNP describes its own current learning state as (∗, ∗, ∗, gi(h), ∗) where h is their current hypothesis/model.",

                "To describe what is necessary for 3., we have to specify (i) under which conditions agents submit bids in response to a CfP, (ii) when they accept bids in the CNP negotiation process, and (iii) how they integrate the received information in their own learning process.",
                "Concerning (i) and (ii), we employ a very simple rule that is identical in both cases: let g be ones own model quality and g that advertised by the CfP (or highest bid, respectively).",
                "If g > g we respond to the CfP (accept the bid), else respond to the CfP (accept the bid) with probability P(g /g) and ignore (reject) it else.",

                "In our experiments, g and g are calculated by an additional agent that acts as a global validation mechanism for all agents (in a more realistic setting a comparison mechanism for different g functions would have to be provided).",
                "As for (iii), each agent uses a single model merging operator taken from the following two classes of operators (hj is the receivers own model and hi is the providers model): • ph→h (hi, hj) : - m-join: The m best clusters (in terms of coverage of Dj) from hypothesis hi are appended to hj. - m-select: The set of the m best clusters (in terms of coverage of Dj) from the union hi ∪hj is chosen as a new model. (Unlike m-join this method does not prefer own clusters over others.) • ph→D (hi, Dj) : - m-filter: The m best clusters (as above) from hi are identified and appended to a new model formed by using those samples not covered by these clusters applying the own learning algorithm fj.",

                "To generate sufficiently realistic properties for fake ships, their individual attribute values are taken from randomly selected ships in the validation set (so that each fake sample is a combination of attribute values of several existing ships).",

                "As can be seen from the performance plots in Figure 3 (homogeneous case) and 4 (heterogeneous case, two agents use the same method and one agent uses the other) this is clearly the case for the (unrestricted) join and filter integration operations (m = k) in both cases.",
                "This is quite natural, as these operations amount to sharing all available model knowledge among agents (under appropriate constraints depending on how beneficial the exchange seems to the agents).",

                "This suggests that heterogeneous learners are able to benefit even from rather limited knowledge sharing (and this is what using a rather small m = 3 amounts to given that k = 10) while this is not always true for homogeneous agents.",
                "This nicely illustrates how different learning or data mining algorithms can specialise on different parts of the problem space and then integrate their local results to achieve better individual performance.",
                "Apart from these obvious performance benefits, integrating partial learning results can also have other advantages: The m-filter operation, for example, decreases the number of learning samples and thus can speed up the learning process.",

                "RELATED WORK We have already mentioned work on distributed (nonagent) machine learning and data mining in the introductory chapter, so in this section we shall restrict ourselves to approaches that are more closely related to our outlook on distributed learning systems.",

                "A typical example for this type of system is the one suggested by Caragea et al. [6] which is based on a distributed support-vector machine approach where agents incrementally join their datasets together according to a fixed distributed algorithm.",
                "A similar example is the work of Weiss [24], where groups of classifier agents learn to organise their activity so as to optimise global system behaviour.",
                "The difference between this kind of collaborative agentbased learning systems [16] and our own framework is that these approaches assume a joint learning goal that is pursued collaboratively by all agents.",
                "Many approaches rely heavily on a homogeneity assumption: Plaza and Ontanon [15] suggest methods for agentbased intelligent reuse of cases in case-based reasoning but is only applicable to societies of homogeneous learners (and coined towards a specific learning method).",
                "An agentbased method for integrating distributed cluster analysis processes using density estimation is presented by Klusch et al. [13] which is also specifically designed for a particular learning algorithm.",
                "The same is true of [22, 23] which both present market-based mechanisms for aggregating the output of multiple learning agents, even though these approaches consider more interesting interaction mechanisms among learners.",
                "A number of approaches for sharing learning data [18] have also been proposed: Grecu and Becker [12] suggest an exchange of learning samples among agents, and Ghosh et al. [11] is a step in the right direction in terms of revealing only partial information about ones learning process as it deals with limited information sharing in distributed clustering.",
                "Papyrus [3] is a system that provides a markup language for meta-description of data, hypotheses and intermediate results and allows for an exchange of all this information among different nodes, however with a strictly cooperative goal of distributing the load for massively distributed data mining tasks.",
                "The MALE system [19] was a very early multiagent learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses.",
                "Agents were able to critique each others hypotheses until agreement was reached.",
                "However, all agents in this system were identical and the system was strictly cooperative.",
                "The ANIMALS system [10] was used to simulate multistrategy learning by combining two or more learning techniques (represented by heterogeneous agents) in order to overcome weaknesses in the individual algorithms, yet it was also a strictly cooperative system.",
                "As these examples show and to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to provide a framework that can accommodate both independent and heterogeneous learning agents and this can be regarded as the main contribution of our work. 6.",

                "To illustrate that the abstract principles of our architecture can be turned into concrete, computational systems, we described a market-based distributed clustering system which was evaluated in the domain of vessel tracking for purposes of identifying deviant or suspicious behaviour.",
                "Although our experimental results only hint at the potential of using our architecture, they underline that what we are proposing is feasible in principle and can have beneficial effects even in its most simple instantiation.",
                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",
                "These issues, together with a more systematic and thorough investigation of advanced interaction and communication mechanisms for distributed, collaborating and competing agents will be the subject of our future work on the subject.",

                "Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents, many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels of detail without being forced to reveal private information that should not be disclosed, 2. decide to what extent they want to share information about their own learning processes and utilise information provided by other learners, and 3. reason about how this information can best be used to improve their own learning performance.",
                "Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e. with the overall objective of improving their own learning results).",

                "For the hypothesis space we obtain H ⊆ {h|h : D → {0, 1}} in the case of classification (i.e. a subset of the set of all possible classifiers, the nature of which depends on the expressivity of the learning algorithm used) and H ⊆ {h|h : D → N, h is total with range {1, . . . , k}} in the case of clustering (i.e. a subset of all sets of possible cluster assignments that map data points to a finite number of clusters numbered 1 to k).",
                "For classification, g might be defined in terms of the numbers of false negatives and false positives with respect to some validation set V ⊆ D, and clustering might use various measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of a current hypothesis, so that Q = R in both cases (but other sets of learning quality levels can be imagined).",
                "Next, we introduce a notion of learning step, which imposes a uniform basic structure on all learning processes that are supposed to exchange information using our framework.",
                "For this, we assume that each learner is presented with a finite set of data D = d1, . . . dk in each step (this is an ordered set to express that the order in which the samples are used for training matters) and employs a training/update function f : H × D∗ → H which updates h given a series of samples d1, . . . , dk.",

                "We define a learning step as a tuple l = D, H, f, g, h where we require that H ⊆ H and h ∈ H. The intuition behind this definition is that each learning step completely describes one learning iteration as shown in Figure 1: in step t, the learner updates the current hypothesis ht−1 with data Dt, and evaluates the resulting new hypothesis ht according to the current performance measure gt.",
                "Such a learning step is equivalent to the following steps of computation: 1. train the algorithm on all samples in D (once), i.e. calculate ft(ht−1, Dt) = ht, 2. calculate the quality gt of the resulting hypothesis gt(ht).",

                "In the most general sense, our learning agents internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g. by appending the new learning action to ones own learning process and leaving all information about others learning processes untouched).",

                "The goal of the agent is to output an optimal learning step in each iteration given the information that it has.",

                "We can see that the quality of these operations is very close to the Single Agent that has access to all training data.",
                "For the restricted (m < k) m-join, m-filter and m-select methods we can also observe an interesting distinction, The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 683 Figure 4: Performance results obtained for different integration operations in heterogeneous societies with the majority of learners using the k-means (top) and k-medoids (bottom) methods namely that these perform similarly to the isolated learner case in homogeneous agent groups but better than isolated learners in more heterogeneous societies.",
                "This suggests that heterogeneous learners are able to benefit even from rather limited knowledge sharing (and this is what using a rather small m = 3 amounts to given that k = 10) while this is not always true for homogeneous agents.",
                "This nicely illustrates how different learning or data mining algorithms can specialise on different parts of the problem space and then integrate their local results to achieve better individual performance.",
                "Apart from these obvious performance benefits, integrating partial learning results can also have other advantages: The m-filter operation, for example, decreases the number of learning samples and thus can speed up the learning process.",
                "The relative number of filtered examples measured in our experiments is shown in the following table. k-means k-medoids filtering 30-40 % 10-20 % m-filtering 20-30 % 5-15 % The overall conclusion we can draw from these initial experiments with our architecture is that since a very simplistic application of its principles has proven capable of improving the performance of individual learning agents, it is worthwhile investigating more complex forms of information exchange about learning processes among autonomous learners. 5.",
                "RELATED WORK We have already mentioned work on distributed (nonagent) machine learning and data mining in the introductory chapter, so in this section we shall restrict ourselves to approaches that are more closely related to our outlook on distributed learning systems.",
                "Very often, approaches that are allegedly agent-based completely disregard agent autonomy and prescribe local decision-making procedures a priori.",
                "A typical example for this type of system is the one suggested by Caragea et al. [6] which is based on a distributed support-vector machine approach where agents incrementally join their datasets together according to a fixed distributed algorithm.",
                "A similar example is the work of Weiss [24], where groups of classifier agents learn to organise their activity so as to optimise global system behaviour.",
                "The difference between this kind of collaborative agentbased learning systems [16] and our own framework is that these approaches assume a joint learning goal that is pursued collaboratively by all agents.",
                "Many approaches rely heavily on a homogeneity assumption: Plaza and Ontanon [15] suggest methods for agentbased intelligent reuse of cases in case-based reasoning but is only applicable to societies of homogeneous learners (and coined towards a specific learning method).",
                "An agentbased method for integrating distributed cluster analysis processes using density estimation is presented by Klusch et al. [13] which is also specifically designed for a particular learning algorithm.",
                "The same is true of [22, 23] which both present market-based mechanisms for aggregating the output of multiple learning agents, even though these approaches consider more interesting interaction mechanisms among learners.",
                "A number of approaches for sharing learning data [18] have also been proposed: Grecu and Becker [12] suggest an exchange of learning samples among agents, and Ghosh et al. [11] is a step in the right direction in terms of revealing only partial information about ones learning process as it deals with limited information sharing in distributed clustering.",
                "Papyrus [3] is a system that provides a markup language for meta-description of data, hypotheses and intermediate results and allows for an exchange of all this information among different nodes, however with a strictly cooperative goal of distributing the load for massively distributed data mining tasks.",
                "The MALE system [19] was a very early multiagent learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses.",
                "Agents were able to critique each others hypotheses until agreement was reached.",
                "However, all agents in this system were identical and the system was strictly cooperative.",
                "The ANIMALS system [10] was used to simulate multistrategy learning by combining two or more learning techniques (represented by heterogeneous agents) in order to overcome weaknesses in the individual algorithms, yet it was also a strictly cooperative system.",
                "As these examples show and to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to provide a framework that can accommodate both independent and heterogeneous learning agents and this can be regarded as the main contribution of our work. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION In this paper, we outlined a generic, abstract framework for distributed machine learning and data mining.",
                "This framework constitutes, to our knowledge, the first attempt 684 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) to capture complex forms of interaction between heterogeneous and/or self-interested learners in an architecture that can be used as the foundation for implementing systems that use complex interaction and reasoning mechanisms to enable agents to inform and improve their learning abilities with information provided by other learners in the system, provided that all agents engage in a sufficiently similar learning activity.",
                "To illustrate that the abstract principles of our architecture can be turned into concrete, computational systems, we described a market-based distributed clustering system which was evaluated in the domain of vessel tracking for purposes of identifying deviant or suspicious behaviour.",
                "Although our experimental results only hint at the potential of using our architecture, they underline that what we are proposing is feasible in principle and can have beneficial effects even in its most simple instantiation.",
                "Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.",
                "This is of course inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of learning results.",
                "Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g. symbolic and numerical).",
                "In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful integration of different agents learning processes.",
                "Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.",
                "These issues, together with a more systematic and thorough investigation of advanced interaction and communication mechanisms for distributed, collaborating and competing agents will be the subject of our future work on the subject.",
