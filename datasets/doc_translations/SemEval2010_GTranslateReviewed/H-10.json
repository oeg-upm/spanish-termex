In this paper, we propose a novel method for clustering documents using regularization. Unlike traditional globally regularized clustering methods, our method first construct a local regularized linear label predictor for each document vector, and then combine all those local regularizers with a global smoothness regularizer. So we call our algorithm Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR). We will show that the cluster memberships of the documents can be achieved by eigenvalue decomposition of a sparse symmetric matrix, which can be efficiently solved by iterative methods. Finally our experimental evaluations on several datasets are presented to show the superiorities of CLGR over traditional document clustering methods.

INTRODUCTION Document clustering has been receiving more and more attentions as an important and fundamental technique for unsupervised document organization, automatic topic extraction, and fast information retrieval or filtering. A good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies. As pointed out by [8], the information retrieval needs can be expressed by a spectrum ranged from narrow keyword-matching based search to broad information browsing such as what are the major international events in recent months. Traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum, i.e. they usually provide specified search for documents matching the users query, however, it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed. In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful. Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and partitioning methods. The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches. For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method. It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster. On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions. For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers. In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods. As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations. In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28]. Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community. The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points. Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph. For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g. Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph. After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal. In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph. In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix. However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer. So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR). The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail. The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2. THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) algorithm in detail. First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors. Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations). The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk. In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di. Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization. In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way. Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24]. For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi. By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector. Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function. A natural problem in Eq.(3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n). To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter. Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix. It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29]. However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set. According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space. In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points. For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes. The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it. Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering. The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi. Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors. In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors. Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj. Then using Eq.(6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik. The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited. Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq.(8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix. Proof. Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i . Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi. Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor. Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi. This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors. Combining Eq.(10) with Eq.(6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way. Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi . Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques. However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset. In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31]. Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x. The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field. Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold. We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points. Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq.(13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj. If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following way wij = e − xi−xj 2 2σ2 , (17) where σ is a dataset dependent parameter. It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18]. In summary, using Eq.(15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold. Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq.(12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg. However, the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space. And it has been shown that the manifold based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks [31]. 3 In this paper, we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi ∈ N(xj) or xj ∈ N(xi). constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem. A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q. Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection. First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later. Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik). Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq.(11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq.(12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc . (25) Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomes J = Jl + λJg = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 + λ(qc )T Lqc = C c=1 (qc )T (P − I)T (P − I) + λL qc = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q , (26) where Q = [q1 , q2 , · · · , qc ] is an n × c matrix, and trace(·) returns the trace of a matrix. The same as in Eq.(20), we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q. Then our optimization problem becomes minQ J = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q s.t. QT Q = I, (27) From the Ky Fan theorem [28], we know the optimal solution of the above problem is Q∗ = [q∗ 1, q∗ 2, · · · , q∗ C ]R, (28) where q∗ k (1 k C) is the eigenvector corresponds to the k-th smallest eigenvalue of matrix (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and R is an arbitrary C × C matrix. Since the values of the entries in Q∗ is continuous, we need to further discretize Q∗ to get the cluster assignments of all the data points. There are mainly two approaches to achieve this goal: 1. As in [20], we can treat the i-th row of Q as the embedding of xi in a C-dimensional space, and apply some traditional clustering methods like kmeans to clustering these embeddings into C clusters. 2. Since the optimal Q∗ is not unique (because of the existence of an arbitrary matrix R), we can pursue an optimal R that will rotate Q∗ to an indication matrix4 . The detailed algorithm can be referred to [26]. The detailed algorithm procedure for CLGR is summarized in table 1. 3. EXPERIMENTS In this section, experiments are conducted to empirically compare the clustering results of CLGR with other 8 representitive document clustering algorithms on 5 datasets. First we will introduce the basic informations of those datasets. 3.1 Datasets We use a variety of datasets, most of which are frequently used in the information retrieval research. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the datasets. 4 Here an indication matrix T is a n×c matrix with its (i, j)th entry Tij ∈ {0, 1} such that for each row of Q∗ there is only one 1. Then the xi can be assigned to the j-th cluster such that j = argjQ∗ ij = 1. Table 1: Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) Input: 1. Dataset X = {xi}n i=1; 2.

This is the dataset of the abstracts of technical reports published in the Department of Computer Science at a university. The dataset contained 476 abstracts, which were divided into four research areas: Natural Language Processing(NLP), Robotics/Vision, Systems, and Theory. WebKB. The WebKB dataset contains webpages gathered from university computer science departments. There are about 8280 documents and they are divided into 7 categories: student, faculty, staff, course, project, department and other. The raw text is about 27MB. Among these 7 categories, student, faculty, course and project are four most populous entity-representing categories. The associated subset is typically called WebKB4. Reuters. The Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Test collection contains documents collected from the Reuters newswire in 1987. It is a standard text categorization benchmark and contains 135 categories. In our experiments, we use a subset of the data collection which includes the 10 most frequent categories among the 135 topics and we call it Reuters-top 10. WebACE. The WebACE dataset was from WebACE project and has been used for document clustering [17][5]. The WebACE dataset contains 2340 documents consisting news articles from Reuters new service via the Web in October 1997. These documents are divided into 20 classes. News4. The News4 dataset used in our experiments are selected from the famous 20-newsgroups dataset5 . The topic rec containing autos, motorcycles, baseball and hockey was selected from the version 20news-18828. The News4 dataset contains 3970 document vectors. 5 http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/ To pre-process the datasets, we remove the stop words using a standard stop list, all HTML tags are skipped and all header fields except subject and organization of the posted articles are ignored. In all our experiments, we first select the top 1000 words by mutual information with class labels. 3.2 Evaluation Metrics In the experiments, we set the number of clusters equal to the true number of classes C for all the clustering algorithms. To evaluate their performance, we compare the clusters generated by these algorithms with the true classes by computing the following two performance measures. Clustering Accuracy (Acc). The first performance measure is the Clustering Accuracy, which discovers the one-toone relationship between clusters and classes and measures the extent to which each cluster contained data points from the corresponding class. It sums up the whole matching degree between all pair class-clusters. Clustering accuracy can be computed as: Acc = 1 N max   Ck,Lm T(Ck, Lm)   , (29) where Ck denotes the k-th cluster in the final results, and Lm is the true m-th class. T(Ck, Lm) is the number of entities which belong to class m are assigned to cluster k. Accuracy computes the maximum sum of T(Ck, Lm) for all pairs of clusters and classes, and these pairs have no overlaps. The greater clustering accuracy means the better clustering performance. Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). Another evaluation metric we adopt here is the Normalized Mutual Information NMI [23], which is widely used for determining the quality of clusters. For two random variable X and Y, the NMI is defined as: NMI(X, Y) = I(X, Y) H(X)H(Y) , (30) where I(X, Y) is the mutual information between X and Y, while H(X) and H(Y) are the entropies of X and Y respectively. One can see that NMI(X, X) = 1, which is the maximal possible value of NMI. Given a clustering result, the NMI in Eq.(30) is estimated as NMI = C k=1 C m=1 nk,mlog n·nk,m nk ˆnm C k=1 nklog nk n C m=1 ˆnmlog ˆnm n , (31) where nk denotes the number of data contained in the cluster Ck (1 k C), ˆnm is the number of data belonging to the m-th class (1 m C), and nk,m denotes the number of data that are in the intersection between the cluster Ck and the m-th class. The value calculated in Eq.(31) is used as a performance measure for the given clustering result. The larger this value, the better the clustering performance. 3.3 Comparisons We have conducted comprehensive performance evaluations by testing our method and comparing it with 8 other representative data clustering methods using the same data corpora. The algorithms that we evaluated are listed below. 1. Traditional k-means (KM). 2. Spherical k-means (SKM). The implementation is based on [9]. 3. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The implementation is based on [16]. 4. Spectral Clustering with Normalized Cuts (Ncut). The implementation is based on [26], and the variance of the Gaussian similarity is determined by Local Scaling [30]. Note that the criterion that Ncut aims to minimize is just the global regularizer in our CLGR algorithm except that Ncut used the normalized Laplacian. 5. Clustering using Pure Local Regularization (CPLR). In this method we just minimize Jl (defined in Eq.(24)), and the clustering results can be obtained by doing eigenvalue decomposition on matrix (I − P)T (I − P) with some proper discretization methods. 6. Adaptive Subspace Iteration (ASI). The implementation is based on [14]. 7. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The implementation is based on [27]. 8. Tri-Factorization Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (TNMF) [12]. The implementation is based on [15]. For computational efficiency, in the implementation of CPLR and our CLGR algorithm, we have set all the local regularization parameters {λi}n i=1 to be identical, which is set by grid search from {0.1, 1, 10}. The size of the k-nearest neighborhoods is set by grid search from {20, 40, 80}. For the CLGR method, its global regularization parameter is set by grid search from {0.1, 1, 10}. When constructing the global regularizer, we have adopted the local scaling method [30] to construct the Laplacian matrix. The final discretization method adopted in these two methods is the same as in [26], since our experiments show that using such method can achieve better results than using kmeans based methods as in [20]. 3.4 Experimental Results The clustering accuracies comparison results are shown in table 3, and the normalized mutual information comparison results are summarized in table 4. From the two tables we mainly observe that: 1. Our CLGR method outperforms all other document clustering methods in most of the datasets; 2. For document clustering, the Spherical k-means method usually outperforms the traditional k-means clustering method, and the GMM method can achieve competitive results compared to the Spherical k-means method; 3. The results achieved from the k-means and GMM type algorithms are usually worse than the results achieved from Spectral Clustering. Since Spectral Clustering can be viewed as a weighted version of kernel k-means, it can obtain good results the data clusters are arbitrarily shaped. This corroborates that the documents vectors are not regularly distributed (spherical or elliptical). 4. The experimental comparisons empirically verify the equivalence between NMF and Spectral Clustering, which Table 3: Clustering accuracies of the various methods CSTR WebKB4 Reuters WebACE News4 KM 0.4256 0.3888 0.4448 0.4001 0.3527 SKM 0.4690 0.4318 0.5025 0.4458 0.3912 GMM 0.4487 0.4271 0.4897 0.4521 0.3844 NMF 0.5713 0.4418 0.4947 0.4761 0.4213 Ncut 0.5435 0.4521 0.4896 0.4513 0.4189 ASI 0.5621 0.4752 0.5235 0.4823 0.4335 TNMF 0.6040 0.4832 0.5541 0.5102 0.4613 CPLR 0.5974 0.5020 0.4832 0.5213 0.4890 CLGR 0.6235 0.5228 0.5341 0.5376 0.5102 Table 4: Normalized mutual information results of the various methods CSTR WebKB4 Reuters WebACE News4 KM 0.3675 0.3023 0.4012 0.3864 0.3318 SKM 0.4027 0.4155 0.4587 0.4003 0.4085 GMM 0.4034 0.4093 0.4356 0.4209 0.3994 NMF 0.5235 0.4517 0.4402 0.4359 0.4130 Ncut 0.4833 0.4497 0.4392 0.4289 0.4231 ASI 0.5008 0.4833 0.4769 0.4817 0.4503 TNMF 0.5724 0.5011 0.5132 0.5328 0.4749 CPLR 0.5695 0.5231 0.4402 0.5543 0.4690 CLGR 0.6012 0.5434 0.4935 0.5390 0.4908 has been proved theoretically in [10]. It can be observed from the tables that NMF and Spectral Clustering usually lead to similar clustering results. 5. The co-clustering based methods (TNMF and ASI) can usually achieve better results than traditional purely document vector based methods. Since these methods perform an implicit feature selection at each iteration, provide an adaptive metric for measuring the neighborhood, and thus tend to yield better clustering results. 6. The results achieved from CPLR are usually better than the results achieved from Spectral Clustering, which supports Vapniks theory [24] that sometimes local learning algorithms can obtain better results than global learning algorithms. Besides the above comparison experiments, we also test the parameter sensibility of our method. There are mainly two sets of parameters in our CLGR algorithm, the local and global regularization parameters ({λi}n i=1 and λ, as we have said in section 3.3, we have set all λis to be identical to λ∗ in our experiments), and the size of the neighborhoods. Therefore we have also done two sets of experiments: 1. Fixing the size of the neighborhoods, and testing the clustering performance with varying λ∗ and λ. In this set of experiments, we find that our CLGR algorithm can achieve good results when the two regularization parameters are neither too large nor too small. Typically our method can achieve good results when λ∗ and λ are around 0.1. Figure 1 shows us such a testing example on the WebACE dataset. 2.

In this set of experiments, we find that the neighborhood with a too large or too small size will all deteriorate the final clustering results. This can be easily understood since when the neighborhood size is very small, then the data points used for training the local classifiers may not be sufficient; when the neighborhood size is very large, the trained classifiers will tend to be global and cannot capture the typical local characteristics. Figure 2 shows us a testing example on the WebACE dataset. Therefore, we can see that our CLGR algorithm (1) can achieve satisfactory results and (2) is not very sensitive to the choice of parameters, which makes it practical in real world applications. 4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS In this paper, we derived a new clustering algorithm called clustering with local and global regularization. Our method preserves the merit of local learning algorithms and spectral clustering. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms most of the state of the art algorithms on many benchmark datasets. In the future, we will focus on the parameter selection and acceleration issues of the CLGR algorithm. 5. REFERENCES [1] L. Baker and A. McCallum.

Introducción La agrupación de documentos ha recibido más y más atenciones como una técnica importante y fundamental para la organización de documentos no supervisada, la extracción automática de temas y la recuperación o el filtrado de información rápida. Un buen enfoque de agrupación de documentos puede ayudar a las computadoras a organizar automáticamente el corpus de documentos en una jerarquía de clúster significativa para navegación y navegación eficientes, lo cual es muy valioso para complementar las deficiencias de las tecnologías de recuperación de información tradicionales. Como se señaló por [8], las necesidades de recuperación de información pueden expresarse mediante un espectro que varió desde una búsqueda estrecha basada en la combinación de palabras clave hasta una amplia navegación de información, como cuáles son los principales eventos internacionales en los últimos meses. Los motores tradicionales de recuperación de documentos tienden a encajar bien con el final de la búsqueda del espectro, es decir, generalmente proporcionan una búsqueda especificada de documentos que coinciden con la consulta de los usuarios, sin embargo, es difícil para ellos satisfacer las necesidades del resto del espectro en la que más bien un bienSe necesita información amplia o vaga. En tales casos, la navegación eficiente a través de una buena jerarquía de clúster será definitivamente útil. En general, los métodos de agrupación de documentos se pueden clasificar principalmente en dos clases: métodos jerárquicos y métodos de partición. Los métodos jerárquicos agrupan los puntos de datos en una estructura de árbol jerárquico utilizando enfoques de abajo hacia arriba o de arriba hacia abajo. Por ejemplo, la agrupación aglomerativa jerárquica (HAC) [13] es un método de agrupación jerárquica típica de ascenso. Se toma cada punto de datos como un solo clúster para comenzar y luego construye grupos cada vez más grandes al agrupar puntos de datos similares hasta que todo el conjunto de datos se encapsule en un clúster final. Por otro lado, los métodos de partición descomponen el conjunto de datos en una serie de grupos de disjunto que generalmente son óptimos en términos de algunas funciones de criterio predefinidas. Por ejemplo, K-means [13] es un método de partición típico que tiene como objetivo minimizar la suma de la distancia al cuadrado entre los puntos de datos y sus centros de clúster correspondientes. En este artículo, nos centraremos en los métodos de partición. Como sabemos, hay dos problemas principales existentes en los métodos de partición (como Kmeans y el modelo de mezcla gaussiana (GMM) [16]): (1) El criterio predefinido suele ser no convexo, lo que causa muchas soluciones óptimas locales;(2) El procedimiento iterativo (p. Ej. En las últimas décadas, se han propuesto muchos métodos para superar los problemas anteriores de los métodos de partición [19] [28]. Recientemente, otro tipo de métodos de partición basados en la agrupación en los gráficos de datos ha despertado intereses considerables en la comunidad de aprendizaje automático y minería de datos. La idea básica detrás de estos métodos es primero modelar todo el conjunto de datos como un gráfico ponderado, en el que los nodos gráficos representan los puntos de datos, y los pesos en los bordes corresponden a las similitudes entre los puntos por pares. Luego, las asignaciones de clúster del conjunto de datos se pueden lograr optimizando algunos criterios definidos en el gráfico. Por ejemplo, la agrupación espectral es un tipo de enfoques de agrupación más representativos basados en gráficos, generalmente tiene como objetivo optimizar algún valor de corte (p. Ej. Corte normalizado [22], corte de relación [7], corte min-max [11]) definido en un gráfico no dirigido. Después de algunas relajaciones, estos criterios generalmente se pueden optimizar a través de decomposiciones propias, lo que garantiza que es global óptimo. De esta manera, la agrupación espectral evita de manera eficiente los problemas de los métodos de partición tradicionales como introdujimos en el último párrafo. En este artículo, proponemos un algoritmo de agrupación de documentos novedoso que hereda la superioridad de la agrupación espectral, es decir, los resultados finales del clúster también se pueden obtener explotando la estructura propia de una matriz simétrica. Sin embargo, a diferencia de la agrupación espectral, que solo impone una restricción de suavidad en las etiquetas de datos en todo el colector de datos [2], nuestro método construye primero un predictor de etiqueta lineal regularizado para cada punto de datos desde su vecindario como en [25], y luego combina, y luego combina.Los resultados de todos estos predictores de etiquetas locales con un regularizador de suavidad de etiqueta global. Entonces llamamos a nuestra agrupación de métodos con regularización local y global (CLGR). La idea de incorporar información local y global en la predicción de la etiqueta se inspira en los trabajos recientes sobre el aprendizaje semi-supervisado [31], y nuestras evaluaciones experimentales en varios conjuntos de datos de documentos reales muestran que CLGR funciona mejor que muchos de última generación.Métodos de agrupación. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la Sección 2 presentaremos nuestro algoritmo CLGR en detalle. Los resultados experimentales en varios conjuntos de datos se presentan en la Sección 3, seguidos de las conclusiones y discusiones en la Sección 4. 2. El algoritmo propuesto en esta sección, presentaremos nuestra agrupación con el algoritmo de regularización local y global (CLGR) en detalle. Primero veamos cómo se representan los documentos a lo largo de este documento.2.1 Representación del documento En nuestro trabajo, todos los documentos están representados por los vectores de frecuencia de término ponderado. Sea w = {w1, w2, · · ·, wm} el conjunto de vocabulario completo del corpus de documentos (que está preprocesado por la eliminación de las palabras de parada y las palabras de las operaciones vistas). El vector de frecuencia de término Xi del documento DI se define como xi = [xi1, xi2, · · ·, xim] t, xik = tik log n idfk, donde tik es la frecuencia del término de wk ∈ W, n es el tamaño deDocument Corpus, IDFK es el número de documentos que contienen Word WK. De esta manera, Xi también se llama TFIDF Representation of Document Di. Además, también normalizamos cada Xi (1 I n) para tener una longitud de unidad, de modo que cada documento esté representado por un vector TF-IDF normalizado.2.2 Regularización local Como su nombre lo indica, CLGR está compuesto por dos partes: regularización local y regularización global. En esta subsección presentaremos la parte de regularización local en detalle.2.2.1 Motivación Como sabemos que la agrupación es un tipo de técnicas de aprendizaje, su objetivo es organizar el conjunto de datos de manera razonable. En términos generales, el aprendizaje se puede plantear como un problema de estimación de funciones, de la cual podemos obtener una buena función de clasificación que asignará etiquetas al conjunto de datos de capacitación e incluso al conjunto de datos de prueba invisible con algún costo minimizado [24]. Por ejemplo, en el escenario de clasificación de dos clases1 (en el que conocemos exactamente la etiqueta de cada documento), un clasificador lineal con un ajuste de mínimo cuadrado tiene como objetivo aprender un vector de columna w de tal manera que el costo al cuadrado j = 1 n (wt xi--yi) 2 (1) se minimiza, donde yi ∈ {+1, −1} es la etiqueta de xi. Al tomar ∂j /∂w = 0, obtenemos la solución w ∗ = n i = 1 xext i −1 n i = 1 xiyi, (2) que se puede escribir en su forma matricial como w ∗ = xxt −1 xy,(3) donde x = [x1, x2, · · ·, xn] es una matriz de documentos m × n, y = [y1, y2, · · ·, yn] t es el vector de etiqueta. Luego, para un documento de prueba t, podemos determinar su etiqueta mediante l = signo (w ∗ t u), (4) donde el signo (·) es la función de signo. Un problema natural en la ecuación.(3) es que la matriz xxt puede ser singular y, por lo tanto, no invertible (por ejemplo, cuando m n). Para evitar tal problema, podemos agregar un término de regularización y minimizar el siguiente criterio j = 1 n n i = 1 (wt xi - yi) 2 + λ w 2, (5) donde λ es un parámetro de regularización. Luego, la solución óptima que minimiza J viene dada por W ∗ = xxt + λni −1 xy, (6) donde i es una matriz de identidad m × m. Se ha informado que el clasificador lineal regularizado puede lograr muy buenos resultados en los problemas de clasificación de texto [29]. Sin embargo, a pesar de su éxito empírico, el clasificador lineal regularizado es en la Tierra un clasificador global, es decir, W ∗ se estima utilizando todo el conjunto de capacitación. Según [24], esta puede no ser una idea inteligente, ya que una w ∗ única puede no ser lo suficientemente buena para predecir las etiquetas de todo el espacio de entrada. Para obtener mejores predicciones, [6] propuso entrenar clasificadores localmente y usarlos para clasificar los puntos de prueba. Por ejemplo, el clasificador local se clasificará con un punto de prueba entrenado utilizando los puntos de entrenamiento ubicados en la vecindad 1 En las siguientes discusiones, todos asumimos que los documentos provenientes de solo dos clases. Las generalizaciones de nuestro método a los casos de múltiples clases se discutirán en la Sección 2.5.de eso. Aunque este método parece lento y estúpido, se informa que puede obtener mejores actuaciones que usar un clasificador global único en ciertas tareas [6].2.2.2 Construcción de los predictores regularizados locales inspirados en su éxito, propusimos aplicar los algoritmos de aprendizaje locales para la agrupación. La idea básica es que, para cada documento Vector XI (1 I n), capacitamos a un predictor de etiqueta local basado en su NI del vecindario K-Nearest, y luego lo usamos para predecir la etiqueta de XI. Finalmente, combinaremos todos esos predictores locales minimizando la suma de sus errores de predicción. En esta subsección presentaremos cómo construir esos predictores locales. Debido a la simplicidad y efectividad del clasificador lineal regularizado que hemos introducido en la Sección 2.2.1, elegimos que sea nuestro predictor de etiqueta local, de modo que para cada documento XI, el siguiente criterio se minimiza ji = 1 ni xj ∈Niwt i xj - qj 2 + λi wi 2, (7) donde ni = | ni |es la cardinalidad de Ni, y QJ es la membresía de clúster de XJ. Luego usando la ecuación.(6), podemos obtener la solución óptima es w ∗ i = xixt i + λinii −1 xiqi, (8) donde xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · ·, xini], y usamos XIK para denotar el k-El vecino más cercano de Xi.Qi = [Qi1, Qi2, · · ·, Qini] t con qik que representa la asignación de clúster de XIK. El problema aquí es que Xixt I es una matriz M × M con M Ni, es decir, debemos calcular el inverso de una matriz M × M para cada vector de documentos, que se prohíbe computacionalmente. Afortunadamente, tenemos el siguiente teorema: Teorema 1. W ∗ I en la ecuación.(8) se puede reescribir como w ∗ i = xi xt i xi + λiniii −1 qi, (9) donde II es una matriz de identidad Ni × Ni. Prueba. Dado que w ∗ i = xext i + λinii −1 xiqi, entonces xext i + λinii w ∗ i = xiqi = ⇒ xext i w ∗ i + λiniw ∗ i = xiqi = ⇒ w ∗ i = (λini) −1 xi qi - utt - ut.i w ∗ i. Sea β = (λini) −1 qi - xt i w ∗ i, entonces w ∗ i = xiβ = ⇒ λiniβ = qi - xt i w ∗ i = qi - xt i xiβ = ⇒ qi = xt i xi + λiniii β = β β β β= Xt I xi + λiniii −1 qi. Por lo tanto, w ∗ i = xiβ = xi xt i xi + λiniii −1 qi 2 usando el teorema 1, solo necesitamos calcular el inverso de una matriz Ni × Ni para cada documento para entrenar un predictor de etiqueta local. Además, para un nuevo punto de prueba U que cae en NI, podemos clasificarlo mediante el signo de qu = w ∗ t i u = ut wi = ut xi xt i xi + λiniii −1 qi. Esta es una expresión atractiva ya que podemos determinar la asignación del clúster de U utilizando los productos internos entre los puntos en {U ∪ Ni}, lo que sugiere que un regularizador tan local puede ser fácilmente kernelizado [21] siempre que definamos AFunción de núcleo adecuada.2.2.3 Combinación de los predictores regularizados locales Después de que todos los predictores locales se hayan construido, los combinaremos minimizando jl = n i = 1 w ∗ t i xi - qi 2, (10) que representa la suma de los errores de predicciónpara todos los predictores locales. Combinando la ecuación.(10) con la ecuación.(6), podemos obtener jl = n i = 1 w ∗ t i xi - qi 2 = n i = 1 xt i xi xt i xi + λiniii −1 qi - qi 2 = pq - q 2, (11) donde q =[Q1, Q2, · · ·, Qn] t, y el P es una matriz N × N de la siguiente manera. Sea αi = xt i xi xt i xi + λiniii −1, entonces pij = αi j, si xj ∈ Ni 0, de lo contrario, (12) donde pij es la entrada (i, j) -th de p, y αi j representaLa entrada j-th de αi. Hasta ahora podemos escribir el criterio de agrupación combinando predictores de etiquetas lineales regularizadas localmente JL en una forma matemática explícita, y podemos minimizarlo directamente utilizando algunas técnicas de optimización estándar. Sin embargo, los resultados pueden no ser lo suficientemente buenos ya que solo explotamos las informaciones locales del conjunto de datos. En la próxima subsección, introduciremos un criterio global de regularización y lo combinaremos con JL, que tiene como objetivo encontrar un buen resultado de agrupación en una forma global local.2.3 Regularización global en la agrupación de datos, generalmente requerimos que las asignaciones de clúster de los puntos de datos sean suficientemente suaves con respecto al colector de datos subyacente, lo que implica (1) los puntos cercanos tienden a tener las mismas asignaciones de clúster;(2) Los puntos en la misma estructura (por ejemplo, submanifold o clúster) tienden a tener las mismas asignaciones de clúster [31]. Sin la pérdida de generalidad, suponemos que los puntos de datos residen (aproximadamente) en un colector de baja dimensión M2, y Q es la función de asignación de clúster definida en M, es decir, 2 creemos que los datos de texto también se muestrean a partir de algunas dimensiones de baja dimensiónManifold, ya que es imposible para ellos para ∀x ∈ M, Q (x) Devuelve la membresía del clúster de x. La suavidad de Q sobre M se puede calcular mediante la siguiente integral de Dirichlet [2] d [Q] = 1 2 m Q (x) 2 dm, (13) donde el gradiente Q es un vector en el espacio tangente t mx, yLa integral se toma con respecto a la medida estándar en M. Si restringimos la escala de Q por Q, Q M = 1 (donde ·, · m es el producto interno inducido en M), entonces resulta que encontrar el más suaveLa función minimización de D [Q] se reduce a encontrar las funciones propias del operador de Laplace Beltrami L, que se define como LQ -Div Q, (14) donde DIV es la divergencia de un campo vectorial. En general, el gráfico puede verse como la forma discretizada de colector. Podemos modelar el conjunto de datos como un gráfico no dirigido ponderado como en la agrupación espectral [22], donde los nodos gráficos son solo los puntos de datos, y los pesos en los bordes representan las similitudes entre los puntos de pareja. Entonces se puede demostrar que minimizar la ecuación.(13) corresponde a minimizar jg = qt lq = n i = 1 (qi - qj) 2 wij, (15) donde q = [q1, q2, · · ·, qn] t con qi = q (xi), l esEl gráfico la laplaciano con su (i, j) -th Entry lij =    di-wii, si i = j −wij, si xi y xj son adyacentes 0, de lo contrario, (16) donde di = j wij es el títulode Xi, WIJ es la similitud entre XI y XJ. Si Xi y Xj son adyacentes3, WIJ generalmente se calcula de la siguiente manera wij = e - xi - xj 2 2σ2, (17) donde σ es un parámetro dependiente del conjunto de datos. Se demuestra que bajo ciertas condiciones, una forma de WIJ para determinar los pesos en los bordes de los gráficos conduce a la convergencia del gráfico Laplacian al operador de Laplace Beltrami [3] [18]. En resumen, usando la ecuación.(15) con pesos exponenciales puede medir efectivamente la suavidad de las asignaciones de datos con respecto al colector de datos intrínsecos. Por lo tanto, lo adoptamos como un regularizador global para castigar la suavidad de las asignaciones de datos predichas.2.4 Agrupación con regularización local y global que combina los contenidos que hemos introducido en la Sección 2.2 y la Sección 2.3 Podemos derivar el criterio de agrupación es minQ J = JL + λJG = PQ - Q 2 + λQT LQ S.T.qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) donde p se define como en la ecuación.(12), y λ es un parámetro de regularización para intercambiar JL y JG. Sin embargo, el relleno discreto en todo el espacio de muestra de alta dimensión. Y se ha demostrado que los métodos basados en el colector pueden lograr buenos resultados en las tareas de clasificación de texto [31].3 En este documento, definimos Xi y XJ como adyacentes si xi ∈ N (xj) o xj ∈ N (xi).La restricción de PI hace que el problema sea un problema de programación de enteros de NP. Una forma natural de hacer el problema solucionable es eliminar la restricción y relajar el Qi para que sea continuo, entonces el objetivo de que nuestro objetivo es minimizar se convierte en j = pq - q 2 + λqt lq = qt (p - i) t (p - i) Q + λqt lq = qt (p - i) t (p - i) + λl q, (19) y agregamos una restricción qt q = 1 para restringir la escala de q. Entonces nuestro objetivo se convierte en minq j = qt (p - i) t (p - i) + λl q s.t.Qt Q = 1 (20) Usando el método lagrangiano, podemos derivar que la solución óptima Q corresponde al vector propio más pequeño de la matriz m = (p - i) t (p - i) + λl, y la asignación del clúster de xipuede determinarse mediante el signo de Qi, es decir, XI se clasificará como clase uno si Qi> 0, de lo contrario, se clasificará como Clase 2. 2.5 CLGR de clase múltiple En lo anterior Hemos introducido el marco básico de la agrupación con Local yRegularización global (CLGR) para el problema de agrupación de dos clases, y la extenderemos a la agrupación de múltiples clases en esta subsección. Primero suponemos que todos los documentos pertenecen a clases C indexadas por l = {1, 2, · · ·, c}.QC es la función de clasificación para la Clase C (1 C C), de modo que QC (XI) devuelve la confianza de que Xi pertenece a la Clase C.Nuestro objetivo es obtener el valor de QC (xi) (1 c c, 1 i n), y la asignación del clúster de Xi puede determinarse por {Qc (xi)} C C = 1 utilizando algunos métodos de discretización adecuados que introduciremosmás tarde. Por lo tanto, en este caso de múltiples clases, para cada documento xi (1 i n), construiremos C predictores de etiqueta regularizados localmente lineales cuyos vectores normales son wc ∗ i = xi xt i xi + λiniii −1 Qc I (1 c c), (21) donde xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · ·, xini] con xik siendo el vecino k-th de xi, y qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · ·, qc ini] t con qcik = QC (xik). Entonces (wc ∗ i) t xi devuelve la confianza prevista de xi perteneciente a la clase c.Por lo tanto, el error de predicción local para la clase C se puede definir como j c l = n i = 1 (wc ∗ i) t xi - qc i 2, (22) y el error de predicción local total se convierte en jl = c c = 1 j c l = cc = 1 n i = 1 (wc ∗ i) t xi - qc i 2.(23) Como en la ecuación.(11), podemos definir una matriz N × N P (ver ecuación (12)) y reescribir JL como JL = C C = 1 J C L = C C = 1 PQC - QC 2.(24) Del mismo modo podemos definir el regularizador de suavidad global en el caso de la clase múltiple como jg = c c = 1 n i = 1 (Qc I-Qc J) 2 wij = c c = 1 (qc) t lqc.(25) Luego, el criterio que se minimizará para CLGR en el caso de clase múltiple se convierte en j = jl + λjg = c c = 1 pqc-qc 2 + λ (qc) t lqc = c c = 1 (qc) t (p −I) t (p - i) + λl qc = traza qt (p - i) t (p - i) + λl q, (26) donde q = [q1, q2, · · ·, qc] es un n ×C Matriz, y Trace (·) devuelve el rastro de una matriz. Lo mismo que en la ecuación.(20), también agregamos la restricción de que qt q = i para restringir la escala de Q. Entonces nuestro problema de optimización se convierte en minq j = traza qt (p - i) t (p - i) + λl q s.t. Qt Q = I, (27) Del teorema del ventilador de Ky [28], sabemos que la solución óptima del problema anterior es q ∗ = [q ∗ 1, q ∗ 2, · · ·, q ∗ c] r, ((28) donde q ∗ k (1 k c) es el vector propio corresponde al valor propio más pequeño de K -th de la matriz (p-i) t (p-i) + λl, y r es una matriz C × C arbitraria. Dado que los valores de las entradas en Q ∗ son continuos, necesitamos discretizar aún más Q ∗ para obtener las asignaciones de clúster de todos los puntos de datos. Hay principalmente dos enfoques para lograr este objetivo: 1. Como en [20], podemos tratar la primera fila de Q como la incrustación de Xi en un espacio c-dimensional, y aplicar algunos métodos de agrupación tradicionales como Kmeans para agrupar estos incrustaciones en grupos C.2. Dado que la Q ∗ óptima no es única (debido a la existencia de una matriz arbitraria R), podemos perseguir una R óptima que girará Q ∗ a una matriz de indicación4. El algoritmo detallado se puede referir [26]. El procedimiento de algoritmo detallado para CLGR se resume en la Tabla 1. 3. Experimentos En esta sección, los experimentos se realizan para comparar empíricamente los resultados de agrupación de CLGR con otros 8 algoritmos de agrupación de documentos representativos en 5 conjuntos de datos. Primero presentaremos la información básica de esos conjuntos de datos.3.1 conjuntos de datos utilizamos una variedad de conjuntos de datos, la mayoría de los cuales se usan con frecuencia en la investigación de recuperación de información. La Tabla 2 resume las características de los conjuntos de datos.4 Aquí una matriz de indicación T es una matriz N × C con su (i, j) th entrada tij ∈ {0, 1} tal que para cada fila de q ∗ solo hay una 1. Entonces el Xi se puede asignar al clúster J-th de tal manera que j = argjq ∗ ij = 1. Tabla 1: Agrupación con entrada de regularización local y global (CLGR) Entrada: 1.

Este es el conjunto de datos de los resúmenes de los informes técnicos publicados en el Departamento de Ciencias de la Computación de una universidad. El conjunto de datos contenía 476 resúmenes, que se dividieron en cuatro áreas de investigación: procesamiento del lenguaje natural (PNL), robótica/visión, sistemas y teoría. Webkb. El conjunto de datos WebKB contiene páginas web reunidas de los departamentos de ciencias de la computación de la universidad. Hay alrededor de 8280 documentos y se dividen en 7 categorías: estudiante, facultad, personal, curso, proyecto, departamento y otros. El texto en bruto es de aproximadamente 27 MB. Entre estas 7 categorías, el estudiante, el profesorado, el curso y el proyecto se encuentran cuatro categorías de representación de entidades más pobladas. El subconjunto asociado generalmente se llama WebKB4. Reuters. La colección de pruebas de categorización de texto Reuters-21578 contiene documentos recopilados de Reuters Newswire en 1987. Es un punto de referencia de categorización de texto estándar y contiene 135 categorías. En nuestros experimentos, utilizamos un subconjunto de la recopilación de datos que incluye las 10 categorías más frecuentes entre los 135 temas y lo llamamos Reuters-Top 10. Webace. El conjunto de datos de Webace fue del proyecto Webace y se ha utilizado para la agrupación de documentos [17] [5]. El conjunto de datos de WebACE contiene 2340 documentos que consisten en artículos de noticias de Reuters New Service a través de la Web en octubre de 1997. Estos documentos se dividen en 20 clases. News4. El conjunto de datos News4 utilizado en nuestros experimentos se seleccionan del famoso conjunto de datos de 20 newsgroups5. El tema Rec que contiene autos, motocicletas, béisbol y hockey se seleccionó de la versión 20News-18828. El conjunto de datos News4 contiene 3970 vectores de documentos.5 http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20newsgroups/ Para preprocesar los conjuntos de datos, eliminamos las palabras de parada utilizando una lista de parada estándar, todas las etiquetas HTML se omiten y todos los campos de encabezado, excepto el sujeto y la organización de la organización de la organización de la organización delSe ignoran los artículos publicados. En todos nuestros experimentos, primero seleccionamos las 1000 palabras principales mediante información mutua con etiquetas de clase.3.2 Métricas de evaluación En los experimentos, establecemos el número de grupos igual al verdadero número de clases C para todos los algoritmos de agrupación. Para evaluar su rendimiento, comparamos los grupos generados por estos algoritmos con las clases verdaderas calculando las siguientes dos medidas de rendimiento. Precisión de agrupación (ACC). La primera medida de rendimiento es la precisión de agrupación, que descubre la relación individual entre grupos y clases y mide hasta qué punto cada clúster contenía puntos de datos de la clase correspondiente. Resume todo el grado de coincidencia entre todos los grupos de clase de par. La precisión de la agrupación se puede calcular como: ACC = 1 N MAX    CK, LM T (CK, LM)   , (29) donde CK denota el clúster K-Th en los resultados finales, y LM es el verdadero M-th.clase. T (CK, LM) es el número de entidades que pertenecen a la clase M se asignan al clúster k.La precisión calcula la suma máxima de T (CK, LM) para todos los pares de grupos y clases, y estos pares no tienen superposiciones. La mayor precisión de agrupación significa el mejor rendimiento de agrupación. Información mutua normalizada (NMI). Otra métrica de evaluación que adoptamos aquí es la información mutua normalizada NMI [23], que se usa ampliamente para determinar la calidad de los grupos. Para dos variables aleatorias x e y, el NMI se define como: nmi (x, y) = i (x, y) h (x) h (y), (30) donde yo (x, y) es la información mutuaEntre x e y, mientras que H (x) y H (y) son las entropías de x e y respectivamente. Se puede ver que NMI (x, x) = 1, que es el valor máximo posible de NMI. Dado un resultado de agrupación, el NMI en la ecuación.(30) se estima como nmi = c k = 1 c m = 1 nk, mlog n · nk, m nk ˆnm c k = 1 nklog nk n c m = 1 ˆnmlog ˆnm n, (31) donde nk denota el número deLos datos contenidos en el clúster CK (1 k c), ˆnm son el número de datos que pertenecen a la clase m-ta (1 m c) y nk, m denota el número de datos que están en la intersección entre el clúster ck yLa clase M-Th. El valor calculado en la ecuación.(31) se usa como medida de rendimiento para el resultado de agrupación dado. Cuanto mayor sea este valor, mejor será el rendimiento de la agrupación.3.3 Comparaciones Hemos realizado evaluaciones de rendimiento integrales al probar nuestro método y compararlo con otros 8 métodos de agrupación de datos representativos utilizando los mismos corpus de datos. Los algoritmos que evaluamos se enumeran a continuación.1. K-means tradicional (km).2. M-MEANS SPHERICAL (SKM). La implementación se basa en [9].3. Modelo de mezcla gaussiana (GMM). La implementación se basa en [16].4. Agrupación espectral con cortes normalizados (NCUT). La implementación se basa en [26], y la varianza de la similitud gaussiana está determinada por la escala local [30]. Tenga en cuenta que el criterio que NCUT tiene como objetivo minimizar es solo el regularizador global en nuestro algoritmo CLGR, excepto que NCUT usó el laplaciano normalizado.5. Agrupación utilizando regularización local pura (CPLR). En este método, simplemente minimizamos JL (definido en la ecuación (24)), y los resultados de la agrupación se pueden obtener haciendo la descomposición del valor propio en la matriz (i - p) t (i - p) con algunos métodos de discretización adecuados.6. Iteración del subespacio adaptativo (ASI). La implementación se basa en [14].7. Factorización de matriz no negativa (NMF). La implementación se basa en [27].8. TRI-Factorización de factorización de matriz no negativa (TNMF) [12]. La implementación se basa en [15]. Para la eficiencia computacional, en la implementación de CPLR y nuestro algoritmo CLGR, hemos establecido todos los parámetros de regularización locales {λi} n i = 1 para ser idénticos, que se establece mediante búsqueda de cuadrícula de {0.1, 1, 10}. El tamaño de los vecindarios K-Nears se establece mediante búsqueda de cuadrícula de {20, 40, 80}. Para el método CLGR, su parámetro de regularización global se establece mediante búsqueda de cuadrícula de {0.1, 1, 10}. Al construir el regularizador global, hemos adoptado el método de escala local [30] para construir la matriz de laplacia. El método de discretización final adoptado en estos dos métodos es el mismo que en [26], ya que nuestros experimentos muestran que el uso de dicho método puede lograr mejores resultados que usar métodos basados en Kmeans como en [20].3.4 Resultados experimentales Los resultados de comparación de precisiones de agrupación se muestran en la Tabla 3, y los resultados de comparación de información mutua normalizadas se resumen en la Tabla 4. De las dos tablas observamos principalmente que: 1. Nuestro método CLGR supera a todos los demás métodos de agrupación de documentos en la mayoría de los conjuntos de datos;2. Para la agrupación de documentos, el método esférico K-Means generalmente supera el método tradicional de agrupación de K-means, y el método GMM puede lograr resultados competitivos en comparación con el método esférico de K-means;3. Los resultados logrados de los algoritmos de tipo K-means y GMM suelen ser peores que los resultados logrados por la agrupación espectral. Dado que la agrupación espectral se puede ver como una versión ponderada de Kernel K-Means, puede obtener buenos resultados, los grupos de datos tienen una forma arbitraria. Esto corrobora que los vectores de documentos no se distribuyen regularmente (esférico o elíptico).4. Las comparaciones experimentales verifican empíricamente la equivalencia entre NMF y la agrupación espectral, cuya Tabla 3: Accuraciones de agrupación de los diversos métodos CSTR Webkb4 Reuters Webace News4 Km 0.4256 0.3888 0.4448 0.4001 0.3527 Skm 0.4690 0.44318 0.5025 0.44458 0.3912 Gmm 0.4447. 4521 0.3844 NMF 0.5713 0.4418 0.49470.4761 0.4213 NCUT 0.5435 0.4521 0.4896 0.4513 0.4189 ASI 0.5621 0.4752 0.5235 0.4823 0.4335 TNMF 0.6040 0.4832 0.5541 0.5102 0.4613 CPLR 5 0.5228 0.5341 0.5376 0.5102 Tabla 4: Resultados de información mutua normalizada de los diversos métodos CSTR WebKB4 Reuters Webace News4 Km 0.36750.3023 0.4012 0.3864 0.3318 SKM 0.4027 0.4155 0.4587 0.4003 0.4085 gmm 0.4034 0.4093 0.4356 0.4209 0.3994 NMF 0.5235 0.4517 0.4402 0.4359 0.4130 ncut 0.4833 0.44920 0.42892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892892N 1 ASI 0.5008 0.4833 0.4769 0.4817 0.4503 TNMF 0.5724 0.5011 0.5132 0.5328 0.4749 CPLR 0.5695 0.5231 0.4402 0.5543 0.4690 CLGR 0.6012 0.5434 0.49350.5390 0.4908 se ha demostrado teóricamente en [10]. Se puede observar desde las tablas que NMF y la agrupación espectral generalmente conducen a resultados de agrupación similares.5. Los métodos basados en co-agrupación (TNMF y ASI) generalmente pueden lograr mejores resultados que los métodos tradicionales basados en vectores puramente documentados. Dado que estos métodos realizan una selección de características implícitas en cada iteración, proporcionan una métrica adaptativa para medir el vecindario y, por lo tanto, tienden a obtener mejores resultados de agrupación.6. Los resultados logrados de CPLR suelen ser mejores que los resultados logrados por la agrupación espectral, que admite la teoría de Vapniks [24] que a veces los algoritmos de aprendizaje locales pueden obtener mejores resultados que los algoritmos de aprendizaje global. Además de los experimentos de comparación anteriores, también probamos la sensibilidad del parámetro de nuestro método. Hay principalmente dos conjuntos de parámetros en nuestro algoritmo CLGR, los parámetros de regularización local y global ({λi} n i = 1 y λ, como hemos dicho en la Sección 3.3, hemos establecido que todos los λis son idénticos a λ ∗ en nuestros experimentos), y el tamaño de los vecindarios. Por lo tanto, también hemos realizado dos conjuntos de experimentos: 1. Fijar el tamaño de los vecindarios y probar el rendimiento de la agrupación con λ λ ∗ y λ. En este conjunto de experimentos, encontramos que nuestro algoritmo CLGR puede lograr buenos resultados cuando los dos parámetros de regularización no son ni demasiado grandes ni demasiado pequeños. Por lo general, nuestro método puede lograr buenos resultados cuando λ ∗ y λ son alrededor de 0.1. La Figura 1 nos muestra tal ejemplo de prueba en el conjunto de datos de Webace.2.

En este conjunto de experimentos, encontramos que el vecindario con un tamaño demasiado grande o demasiado pequeño deteriorará los resultados finales de agrupación. Esto se puede entender fácilmente ya que cuando el tamaño del vecindario es muy pequeño, los puntos de datos utilizados para entrenar a los clasificadores locales pueden no ser suficientes;Cuando el tamaño del vecindario es muy grande, los clasificadores entrenados tenderán a ser globales y no pueden capturar las características locales típicas. La Figura 2 nos muestra un ejemplo de prueba en el conjunto de datos de Webace. Por lo tanto, podemos ver que nuestro algoritmo CLGR (1) puede lograr resultados satisfactorios y (2) no es muy sensible a la elección de los parámetros, lo que lo hace práctico en aplicaciones del mundo real.4. Conclusiones y trabajos futuros En este documento, derivamos un nuevo algoritmo de agrupación llamado clúster con regularización local y global. Nuestro método conserva el mérito de los algoritmos de aprendizaje locales y la agrupación espectral. Nuestros experimentos muestran que el algoritmo propuesto supera a la mayoría de los algoritmos de última generación en muchos conjuntos de datos de referencia. En el futuro, nos centraremos en los problemas de selección y aceleración de parámetros del algoritmo CLGR.5. Referencias [1] L. Baker y A. McCallum.

        "In this paper, we propose a novel method for clustering documents using regularization.",
        "Unlike traditional globally regularized clustering methods, our method first construct a local regularized linear label predictor for each document vector, and then combine all those local regularizers with a global smoothness regularizer.",
        "So we call our algorithm Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).",
        "We will show that the cluster memberships of the documents can be achieved by eigenvalue decomposition of a sparse symmetric matrix, which can be efficiently solved by iterative methods.",
        "Finally our experimental evaluations on several datasets are presented to show the superiorities of CLGR over traditional document clustering methods.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval-Clustering; I.2.6 [Artificial Intelligence]: Learning-Concept Learning General Terms Algorithms 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Document clustering has been receiving more and more attentions as an important and fundamental technique for unsupervised document organization, automatic topic extraction, and fast information retrieval or filtering.",
        "A good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies.",
        "As pointed out by [8], the information retrieval needs can be expressed by a spectrum ranged from narrow keyword-matching based search to broad information browsing such as what are the major international events in recent months.",
        "Traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum, i.e. they usually provide specified search for documents matching the users query, however, it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed.",
        "In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.",
        "Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and partitioning methods.",
        "The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.",
        "For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method.",
        "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
        "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
        "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
        "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
        "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
        "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
        "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
        "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
        "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
        "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
        "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
        "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
        "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
        "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
        "So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).",
        "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
        "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
        "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
        "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
        "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
        "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
        "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
        "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization.",
        "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
        "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
        "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
        "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
        "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
        "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
        "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
        "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
        "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
        "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
        "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
        "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
        "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
        "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
        "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
        "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
        "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
        "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
        "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
        "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
        "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
        "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
        "Proof.",
        "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
        "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
        "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
        "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
        "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
        "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
        "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
        "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
        "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
        "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
        "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
        "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
        "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.",
        "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",
        "Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq. (13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",
        "If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following way wij = e − xi−xj 2 2σ2 , (17) where σ is a dataset dependent parameter.",
        "It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18].",
        "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold.",
        "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",
        "However, the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space.",
        "And it has been shown that the manifold based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks [31]. 3 In this paper, we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi ∈ N(xj) or xj ∈ N(xi). constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem.",
        "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
        "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",
        "First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",
        "Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik).",
        "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc . (25) Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomes J = Jl + λJg = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 + λ(qc )T Lqc = C c=1 (qc )T (P − I)T (P − I) + λL qc = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q , (26) where Q = [q1 , q2 , · · · , qc ] is an n × c matrix, and trace(·) returns the trace of a matrix.",
        "The same as in Eq. (20), we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q.",
        "Then our optimization problem becomes minQ J = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q s.t.",
        "QT Q = I, (27) From the Ky Fan theorem [28], we know the optimal solution of the above problem is Q∗ = [q∗ 1, q∗ 2, · · · , q∗ C ]R, (28) where q∗ k (1 k C) is the eigenvector corresponds to the k-th smallest eigenvalue of matrix (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and R is an arbitrary C × C matrix.",
        "Since the values of the entries in Q∗ is continuous, we need to further discretize Q∗ to get the cluster assignments of all the data points.",
        "There are mainly two approaches to achieve this goal: 1.",
        "As in [20], we can treat the i-th row of Q as the embedding of xi in a C-dimensional space, and apply some traditional clustering methods like kmeans to clustering these embeddings into C clusters. 2.",
        "Since the optimal Q∗ is not unique (because of the existence of an arbitrary matrix R), we can pursue an optimal R that will rotate Q∗ to an indication matrix4 .",
        "The detailed algorithm can be referred to [26].",
        "The detailed algorithm procedure for CLGR is summarized in table 1. 3.",
        "EXPERIMENTS In this section, experiments are conducted to empirically compare the clustering results of CLGR with other 8 representitive document clustering algorithms on 5 datasets.",

(30) is estimated as NMI = C k=1 C m=1 nk,mlog n·nk,m nk ˆnm C k=1 nklog nk n C m=1 ˆnmlog ˆnm n , (31) where nk denotes the number of data contained in the cluster Ck (1 k C), ˆnm is the number of data belonging to the m-th class (1 m C), and nk,m denotes the number of data that are in the intersection between the cluster Ck and the m-th class.",
        "The value calculated in Eq. (31) is used as a performance measure for the given clustering result.",

                "A good <br>document clustering</br> approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies.",
                "As pointed out by [8], the information retrieval needs can be expressed by a spectrum ranged from narrow keyword-matching based search to broad information browsing such as what are the major international events in recent months.",
                "Traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum, i.e. they usually provide specified search for documents matching the users query, however, it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed.",
                "In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.",
                "Generally, <br>document clustering</br> methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and partitioning methods.",
                "The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.",
                "For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method.",
                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
                "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
                "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
                "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
                "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel <br>document clustering</br> algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
                "So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).",
                "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
                "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
                "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
                "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
                "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
                "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
                "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
                "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
                "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
                "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
                "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
                "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.",
                "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq.

                "It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18].",
                "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold.",
                "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",

                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",

Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",

                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc .

                "A good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies.",
                "As pointed out by [8], the information retrieval needs can be expressed by a spectrum ranged from narrow keyword-matching based search to broad information browsing such as what are the major international events in recent months.",
                "Traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum, i.e. they usually provide specified search for documents matching the users query, however, it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed.",
                "In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.",
                "Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and partitioning methods.",
                "The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.",
                "For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method.",
                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
                "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
                "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
                "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
                "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
                "So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global <br>regularization</br> (CLGR).",
                "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
                "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
                "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global <br>regularization</br> (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
                "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
                "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
                "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local <br>regularization</br> As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local <br>regularization</br> and global regularization.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local <br>regularization</br> part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a <br>regularization</br> term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a <br>regularization</br> parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
                "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
                "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
                "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",

                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global <br>regularization</br> criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global <br>regularization</br> In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",

If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",

(13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",

                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global <br>regularization</br> (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",

                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc .

                "A good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies.",
                "As pointed out by [8], the information retrieval needs can be expressed by a spectrum ranged from narrow keyword-matching based search to broad information browsing such as what are the major international events in recent months.",
                "Traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum, i.e. they usually provide specified search for documents matching the users query, however, it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed.",
                "In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.",
                "Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and partitioning methods.",
                "The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.",
                "For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method.",
                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
                "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
                "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
                "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
                "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
                "So we call our method Clustering with Local and <br>global regularization</br> (CLGR).",
                "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
                "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
                "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and <br>global regularization</br> (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
                "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
                "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
                "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and <br>global regularization</br>.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",

                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",

                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",

                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
                "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a <br>global regularization</br> criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 <br>global regularization</br> In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
                "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
                "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.",
                "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",

(13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",

                "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold.",
                "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and <br>global regularization</br> Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",

                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and <br>global regularization</br> (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",
                "First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",
                "Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik).",
                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc .

                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
                "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
                "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
                "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
                "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
                "So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).",
                "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
                "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
                "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
                "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
                "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
                "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
                "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
                "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
                "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
                "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
                "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
                "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.",
                "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq. (13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",
                "If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following way wij = e − xi−xj 2 2σ2 , (17) where σ is a dataset dependent parameter.",
                "It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18].",
                "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold.",
                "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",
                "However, the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space.",
                "And it has been shown that the manifold based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks [31]. 3 In this paper, we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi ∈ N(xj) or xj ∈ N(xi). constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem.",
                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",
                "First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",
                "Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik).",
                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc . (25) Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomes J = Jl + λJg = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 + λ(qc )T Lqc = C c=1 (qc )T (P − I)T (P − I) + λL qc = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q , (26) where Q = [q1 , q2 , · · · , qc ] is an n × c matrix, and trace(·) returns the trace of a matrix.",
                "The same as in Eq. (20), we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q.",
                "Then our optimization problem becomes minQ J = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q s.t.",
                "QT Q = I, (27) From the Ky Fan theorem [28], we know the optimal solution of the above problem is Q∗ = [q∗ 1, q∗ 2, · · · , q∗ C ]R, (28) where q∗ k (1 k C) is the eigenvector corresponds to the k-th smallest eigenvalue of matrix (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and R is an arbitrary C × C matrix.",
                "Since the values of the entries in Q∗ is continuous, we need to further discretize Q∗ to get the cluster assignments of all the data points.",

                "In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.",
                "Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and partitioning methods.",
                "The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.",
                "For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method.",
                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
                "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
                "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
                "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
                "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
                "So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).",
                "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
                "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
                "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
                "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
                "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
                "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
                "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
                "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
                "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
                "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
                "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
                "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.",
                "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq. (13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",
                "If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following way wij = e − xi−xj 2 2σ2 , (17) where σ is a dataset dependent parameter.",
                "It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18].",
                "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold.",
                "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",
                "However, the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space.",
                "And it has been shown that the manifold based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks [31]. 3 In this paper, we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi ∈ N(xj) or xj ∈ N(xi). constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem.",
                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",
                "First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",
                "Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik).",
                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc . (25) Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomes J = Jl + λJg = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 + λ(qc )T Lqc = C c=1 (qc )T (P − I)T (P − I) + λL qc = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q , (26) where Q = [q1 , q2 , · · · , qc ] is an n × c matrix, and trace(·) returns the trace of a matrix.",
                "The same as in Eq. (20), we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q.",
                "Then our optimization problem becomes minQ J = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q s.t.",
                "QT Q = I, (27) From the Ky Fan theorem [28], we know the optimal solution of the above problem is Q∗ = [q∗ 1, q∗ 2, · · · , q∗ C ]R, (28) where q∗ k (1 k C) is the eigenvector corresponds to the k-th smallest eigenvalue of matrix (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and R is an arbitrary C × C matrix.",
                "Since the values of the entries in Q∗ is continuous, we need to further discretize Q∗ to get the cluster assignments of all the data points.",

                "In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.",
                "Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and partitioning methods.",
                "The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.",
                "For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method.",
                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
                "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
                "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
                "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
                "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
                "So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).",
                "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
                "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
                "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
                "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
                "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
                "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
                "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
                "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
                "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
                "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
                "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
                "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.",
                "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq. (13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",
                "If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following way wij = e − xi−xj 2 2σ2 , (17) where σ is a dataset dependent parameter.",
                "It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18].",
                "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold.",
                "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",
                "However, the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space.",
                "And it has been shown that the manifold based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks [31]. 3 In this paper, we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi ∈ N(xj) or xj ∈ N(xi). constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem.",
                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",
                "First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",
                "Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik).",
                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc . (25) Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomes J = Jl + λJg = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 + λ(qc )T Lqc = C c=1 (qc )T (P − I)T (P − I) + λL qc = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q , (26) where Q = [q1 , q2 , · · · , qc ] is an n × c matrix, and trace(·) returns the trace of a matrix.",
                "The same as in Eq. (20), we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q.",
                "Then our optimization problem becomes minQ J = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q s.t.",
                "QT Q = I, (27) From the Ky Fan theorem [28], we know the optimal solution of the above problem is Q∗ = [q∗ 1, q∗ 2, · · · , q∗ C ]R, (28) where q∗ k (1 k C) is the eigenvector corresponds to the k-th smallest eigenvalue of matrix (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and R is an arbitrary C × C matrix.",
                "Since the values of the entries in Q∗ is continuous, we need to further discretize Q∗ to get the cluster assignments of all the data points.",

                "A good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies.",
                "As pointed out by [8], the information retrieval needs can be expressed by a spectrum ranged from narrow keyword-matching based search to broad information browsing such as what are the major international events in recent months.",
                "Traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum, i.e. they usually provide specified search for documents matching the users query, however, it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed.",
                "In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.",
                "Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: <br>hierarchical method</br>s and partitioning methods.",
                "The <br>hierarchical method</br>s group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.",
                "For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method.",
                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
                "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
                "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
                "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
                "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
                "So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).",
                "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
                "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
                "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
                "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
                "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
                "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
                "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
                "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
                "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
                "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
                "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
                "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.",
                "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq. (13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",
                "If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following way wij = e − xi−xj 2 2σ2 , (17) where σ is a dataset dependent parameter.",
                "It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18].",
                "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold.",
                "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",
                "However, the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space.",
                "And it has been shown that the manifold based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks [31]. 3 In this paper, we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi ∈ N(xj) or xj ∈ N(xi). constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem.",
                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",
                "First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",
                "Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik).",
                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc . (25) Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomes J = Jl + λJg = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 + λ(qc )T Lqc = C c=1 (qc )T (P − I)T (P − I) + λL qc = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q , (26) where Q = [q1 , q2 , · · · , qc ] is an n × c matrix, and trace(·) returns the trace of a matrix.",
                "The same as in Eq. (20), we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q.",
                "Then our optimization problem becomes minQ J = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q s.t.",
                "QT Q = I, (27) From the Ky Fan theorem [28], we know the optimal solution of the above problem is Q∗ = [q∗ 1, q∗ 2, · · · , q∗ C ]R, (28) where q∗ k (1 k C) is the eigenvector corresponds to the k-th smallest eigenvalue of matrix (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and R is an arbitrary C × C matrix.",
                "Since the values of the entries in Q∗ is continuous, we need to further discretize Q∗ to get the cluster assignments of all the data points.",

                "A good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies.",
                "As pointed out by [8], the information retrieval needs can be expressed by a spectrum ranged from narrow keyword-matching based search to broad information browsing such as what are the major international events in recent months.",
                "Traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum, i.e. they usually provide specified search for documents matching the users query, however, it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed.",
                "In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.",
                "Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and partitioning methods.",
                "The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.",
                "For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method.",
                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
                "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical <br>partitioning method</br> which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
                "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
                "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
                "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
                "So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).",
                "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
                "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
                "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
                "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
                "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
                "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
                "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
                "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
                "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
                "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
                "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
                "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.",
                "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq. (13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",
                "If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following way wij = e − xi−xj 2 2σ2 , (17) where σ is a dataset dependent parameter.",
                "It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18].",
                "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold.",
                "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",
                "However, the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space.",
                "And it has been shown that the manifold based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks [31]. 3 In this paper, we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi ∈ N(xj) or xj ∈ N(xi). constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem.",
                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",
                "First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",
                "Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik).",
                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc . (25) Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomes J = Jl + λJg = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 + λ(qc )T Lqc = C c=1 (qc )T (P − I)T (P − I) + λL qc = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q , (26) where Q = [q1 , q2 , · · · , qc ] is an n × c matrix, and trace(·) returns the trace of a matrix.",
                "The same as in Eq. (20), we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q.",
                "Then our optimization problem becomes minQ J = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q s.t.",
                "QT Q = I, (27) From the Ky Fan theorem [28], we know the optimal solution of the above problem is Q∗ = [q∗ 1, q∗ 2, · · · , q∗ C ]R, (28) where q∗ k (1 k C) is the eigenvector corresponds to the k-th smallest eigenvalue of matrix (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and R is an arbitrary C × C matrix.",
                "Since the values of the entries in Q∗ is continuous, we need to further discretize Q∗ to get the cluster assignments of all the data points.",

                "A good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies.",

                "Traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum, i.e. they usually provide specified search for documents matching the users query, however, it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed.",
                "In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.",
                "Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and partitioning methods.",
                "The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.",
                "For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method.",
                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
                "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
                "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
                "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
                "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
                "So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).",
                "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into <br>label prediction</br> is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
                "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
                "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
                "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
                "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
                "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
                "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
                "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
                "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
                "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
                "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
                "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.",
                "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq. (13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",
                "If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following way wij = e − xi−xj 2 2σ2 , (17) where σ is a dataset dependent parameter.",
                "It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18].",
                "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold.",
                "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",
                "However, the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space.",
                "And it has been shown that the manifold based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks [31]. 3 In this paper, we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi ∈ N(xj) or xj ∈ N(xi). constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem.",
                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",
                "First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",
                "Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik).",
                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc . (25) Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomes J = Jl + λJg = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 + λ(qc )T Lqc = C c=1 (qc )T (P − I)T (P − I) + λL qc = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q , (26) where Q = [q1 , q2 , · · · , qc ] is an n × c matrix, and trace(·) returns the trace of a matrix.",
                "The same as in Eq. (20), we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q.",
                "Then our optimization problem becomes minQ J = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q s.t.",
                "QT Q = I, (27) From the Ky Fan theorem [28], we know the optimal solution of the above problem is Q∗ = [q∗ 1, q∗ 2, · · · , q∗ C ]R, (28) where q∗ k (1 k C) is the eigenvector corresponds to the k-th smallest eigenvalue of matrix (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and R is an arbitrary C × C matrix.",
                "Since the values of the entries in Q∗ is continuous, we need to further discretize Q∗ to get the cluster assignments of all the data points.",

                "A good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies.",
                "As pointed out by [8], the information retrieval needs can be expressed by a spectrum ranged from narrow keyword-matching based search to broad information browsing such as what are the major international events in recent months.",
                "Traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum, i.e. they usually provide specified search for documents matching the users query, however, it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed.",
                "In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.",
                "Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and partitioning methods.",
                "The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.",
                "For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method.",
                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
                "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
                "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
                "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
                "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
                "So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).",
                "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
                "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
                "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
                "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
                "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
                "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of <br>function estimation</br>, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
                "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
                "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
                "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
                "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
                "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
                "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.",
                "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq. (13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",
                "If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following way wij = e − xi−xj 2 2σ2 , (17) where σ is a dataset dependent parameter.",
                "It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18].",
                "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold.",
                "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",
                "However, the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space.",
                "And it has been shown that the manifold based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks [31]. 3 In this paper, we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi ∈ N(xj) or xj ∈ N(xi). constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem.",
                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",
                "First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",
                "Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik).",
                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc . (25) Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomes J = Jl + λJg = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 + λ(qc )T Lqc = C c=1 (qc )T (P − I)T (P − I) + λL qc = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q , (26) where Q = [q1 , q2 , · · · , qc ] is an n × c matrix, and trace(·) returns the trace of a matrix.",
                "The same as in Eq. (20), we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q.",
                "Then our optimization problem becomes minQ J = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q s.t.",
                "QT Q = I, (27) From the Ky Fan theorem [28], we know the optimal solution of the above problem is Q∗ = [q∗ 1, q∗ 2, · · · , q∗ C ]R, (28) where q∗ k (1 k C) is the eigenvector corresponds to the k-th smallest eigenvalue of matrix (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and R is an arbitrary C × C matrix.",
                "Since the values of the entries in Q∗ is continuous, we need to further discretize Q∗ to get the cluster assignments of all the data points.",

                "A good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies.",
                "As pointed out by [8], the information retrieval needs can be expressed by a spectrum ranged from narrow keyword-matching based search to broad information browsing such as what are the major international events in recent months.",
                "Traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum, i.e. they usually provide specified search for documents matching the users query, however, it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed.",
                "In such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.",
                "Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and partitioning methods.",
                "The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.",
                "For example, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method.",
                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",
                "For instance, K-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.",
                "In this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.",
                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",
                "After some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.",
                "In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.",
                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data <br>manifold</br> [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",
                "So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).",
                "The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail.",
                "The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 2.",
                "THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM In this section, we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) algorithm in detail.",
                "First lets see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper. 2.1 Document Representation In our work, all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors.",
                "Let W = {w1, w2, · · · , wm} be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus (which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations).",
                "The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined as xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xim]T , xik = tik log n idfk , where tik is the term frequency of wk ∈ W, n is the size of the document corpus, idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk.",
                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
                "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
                "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
                "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
                "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data <br>manifold</br>, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional <br>manifold</br> M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional <br>manifold</br>, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
                "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
                "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of <br>manifold</br>.",
                "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq. (13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",
                "If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following way wij = e − xi−xj 2 2σ2 , (17) where σ is a dataset dependent parameter.",
                "It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18].",
                "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data <br>manifold</br>.",
                "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",
                "However, the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space.",
                "And it has been shown that the <br>manifold</br> based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks [31]. 3 In this paper, we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi ∈ N(xj) or xj ∈ N(xi). constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem.",
                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",
                "First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",
                "Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik).",
                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc . (25) Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomes J = Jl + λJg = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 + λ(qc )T Lqc = C c=1 (qc )T (P − I)T (P − I) + λL qc = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q , (26) where Q = [q1 , q2 , · · · , qc ] is an n × c matrix, and trace(·) returns the trace of a matrix.",
                "The same as in Eq. (20), we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q.",

                "It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.",
                "On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.",

                "As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations.",
                "In the last decades, many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].",
                "Recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community.",
                "The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.",
                "For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to optimize some cut value (e.g.",
                "Normalized Cut [22], Ratio Cut [7], Min-Max Cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.",

                "However, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.",

                "In this way, xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di.",
                "Furthermore, we also normalize each xi (1 i n) to have a unit length, so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector. 2.2 Local Regularization As its name suggests, CLGR is composed of two parts: local regularization and global regularization.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail. 2.2.1 Motivation As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques, it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way.",
                "Generally speaking, learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation, from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized [24].",
                "For example, in the two-class classification scenario1 (in which we exactly know the label of each document), a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared cost J = 1 n (wT xi − yi)2 (1) is minimized, where yi ∈ {+1, −1} is the label of xi.",
                "By taking ∂J /∂w = 0, we get the solution w∗ = n i=1 xixT i −1 n i=1 xiyi , (2) which can further be written in its matrix form as w∗ = XXT −1 Xy, (3) where X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] is an m × n document matrix, y = [y1, y2, · · · , yn]T is the label vector.",
                "Then for a test document t, we can determine its label by l = sign(w∗T u), (4) where sign(·) is the sign function.",
                "A natural problem in Eq. (3) is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable (e.g. when m n).",
                "To avoid such a problem, we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterion J = 1 n n i=1 (wT xi − yi)2 + λ w 2 , (5) where λ is a regularization parameter.",
                "Then the optimal solution that minimize J is given by w∗ = XXT + λnI −1 Xy, (6) where I is an m × m identity matrix.",
                "It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems [29].",
                "However, despite its empirical success, the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier, i.e. w∗ is estimated using the whole training set.",
                "According to [24], this may not be a smart idea, since a unique w∗ may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space.",
                "In order to get better predictions, [6] proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points.",
                "For example, a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1 In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes.",
                "The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5. of it.",
                "Although this method seems slow and stupid, it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks [6]. 2.2.2 Constructing the Local Regularized Predictors Inspired by their success, we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering.",
                "The basic idea is that, for each document vector xi (1 i n), we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni, and then use it to predict the label of xi.",
                "Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors.",
                "In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors.",
                "Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the cluster membership of xj.",
                "Then using Eq. (6), we can get the optimal solution is w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, (8) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ], and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi. qi = [qi1, qi2, · · · , qini ]T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik.",
                "The problem here is that XiXT i is an m × m matrix with m ni, i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m × m matrix for every document vector, which is computationally prohibited.",
                "Fortunately, we have the following theorem: Theorem 1. w∗ i in Eq. (8) can be rewritten as w∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi, (9) where Ii is an ni × ni identity matrix.",
                "Proof.",
                "Since w∗ i = XiXT i + λiniI −1 Xiqi, then XiXT i + λiniI w∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ XiXT i w∗ i + λiniw∗ i = Xiqi =⇒ w∗ i = (λini)−1 Xi qi − XT i w∗ i .",
                "Let β = (λini)−1 qi − XT i w∗ i , then w∗ i = Xiβ =⇒ λiniβ = qi − XT i w∗ i = qi − XT i Xiβ =⇒ qi = XT i Xi + λiniIi β =⇒ β = XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "Therefore w∗ i = Xiβ = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi 2 Using theorem 1, we only need to compute the inverse of an ni × ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor.",
                "Moreover, for a new testing point u that falls into Ni, we can classify it by the sign of qu = w∗T i u = uT wi = uT Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi.",
                "This is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in {u ∪ Ni}, which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized [21] as long as we define a proper kernel function. 2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.",
                "Combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (6), we can get Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 = n i=1 xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qi − qi 2 = Pq − q 2 , (11) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T , and the P is an n × n matrix constructing in the following way.",
                "Let αi = xT i Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 , then Pij = αi j, if xj ∈ Ni 0, otherwise , (12) where Pij is the (i, j)-th entry of P, and αi j represents the j-th entry of αi .",
                "Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form, and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques.",
                "However, the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset.",
                "In the next subsection, we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl, which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way. 2.3 Global Regularization In data clustering, we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold, which implies (1) the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments; (2) the points on the same structure (e.g. submanifold or cluster) tend to have the same cluster assignments [31].",
                "Without the loss of generality, we assume that the data points reside (roughly) on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M, i.e. 2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.",
                "The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral [2] D[q] = 1 2 M q(x) 2 dM, (13) where the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space T Mx, and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M. If we restrict the scale of q by q, q M = 1 (where ·, · M is the inner product induced on M), then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D[q] reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L, which is defined as Lq −div q, (14) where div is the divergence of a vector field.",
                "Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.",
                "We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering [22], where the graph nodes are just the data points, and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points.",
                "Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq. (13) corresponds to minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.",
                "If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following way wij = e − xi−xj 2 2σ2 , (17) where σ is a dataset dependent parameter.",
                "It is proved that under certain conditions, such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator [3][18].",
                "In summary, using Eq. (15) with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold.",
                "Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments. 2.4 Clustering with Local and Global Regularization Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + λJg = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq s.t. qi ∈ {−1, +1}, (18) where P is defined as in Eq. (12), and λ is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg.",
                "However, the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space.",
                "And it has been shown that the manifold based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks [31]. 3 In this paper, we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi ∈ N(xj) or xj ∈ N(xi). constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem.",
                "A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous, then the objective that we aims to minimize becomes J = Pq − q 2 + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I)q + λqT Lq = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q, (19) and we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q.",
                "Then our objective becomes minq J = qT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL q s.t. qT q = 1 (20) Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = (P − I)T (P − I) + λL, and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi, i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0, otherwise it will be classified as class 2. 2.5 Multi-Class CLGR In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) for the two-class clustering problem, and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection.",
                "First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = {1, 2, · · · , C}. qc is the classification function for class c (1 c C), such that qc (xi) returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c. Our goal is to obtain the value of qc (xi) (1 c C, 1 i n), and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by {qc (xi)}C c=1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later.",
                "Therefore, in this multi-class case, for each document xi (1 i n), we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are wc∗ i = Xi XT i Xi + λiniIi −1 qc i (1 c C), (21) where Xi = [xi1, xi2, · · · , xini ] with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi, and qc i = [qc i1, qc i2, · · · , qc ini ]T with qc ik = qc (xik).",
                "Then (wc∗ i )T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined as J c l = n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 , (22) And the total local prediction error becomes Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 n i=1 (wc∗ i ) T xi − qc i 2 . (23) As in Eq. (11), we can define an n×n matrix P (see Eq. (12)) and rewrite Jl as Jl = C c=1 J c l = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 . (24) Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizer in multi-class case as Jg = C c=1 n i=1 (qc i − qc j )2 wij = C c=1 (qc )T Lqc . (25) Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomes J = Jl + λJg = C c=1 Pqc − qc 2 + λ(qc )T Lqc = C c=1 (qc )T (P − I)T (P − I) + λL qc = trace QT (P − I)T (P − I) + λL Q , (26) where Q = [q1 , q2 , · · · , qc ] is an n × c matrix, and trace(·) returns the trace of a matrix.",
                "The same as in Eq. (20), we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q.",
