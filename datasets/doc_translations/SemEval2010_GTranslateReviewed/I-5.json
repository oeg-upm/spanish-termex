These techniques need to take into account the heterogeneity and potential unreliability of resources and resource consumers in a distributed environments. In this paper we propose a distributed algorithm that solves the resource allocation problem in distributed multiagent systems. Our solution is based on the self-organisation of agents, which does not require any facilitator or management layer. The resource allocation in the system is a purely emergent effect. We present results of the proposed resource allocation mechanism in the simulated static and dynamic multi-server environment.

INTRODUCTION With the increasing popularity of distributed computing technologies such as Grid [12] and Web services [20], the Internet is becoming a powerful computing platform where different software peers (e.g., agents) can use existing computing resources to perform tasks. In this sense, each agent is a resource consumer that acquires a certain amount of resources for the execution of its tasks. It is difficult for a central resource allocation mechanism to collect and manage the information about all shared resources and resource consumers to effectively perform the allocation of resources. Hence, distributed solutions of the resource allocation problem are required. Researchers have recognised these requirements [10] and proposed techniques for distributed resource allocation. A promising kind of such distributed approaches are based on economic market models [4], inspired by principles of real stock markets. Even if those approaches are distributed, they usually require a facilitator for pricing, resource discovery and dispatching jobs to resources [5, 9]. Another mainly unsolved problem of those approaches is the fine-tuning of price and time, budget constraints to enable efficient resource allocation in large, dynamic systems [22]. In this paper we propose a distributed solution of the resource allocation problem based on self-organisation of the resource consumers in a system with limited resources. In our approach, agents dynamically allocate tasks to servers that provide a limited amount of resources. In our approach, agents select autonomously the execution platform for the task rather than ask a resource broker to do the allocation. All control needed for our algorithm is distributed among the agents in the system. They optimise the resource allocation process continuously over their lifetime to changes in the availability of shared resources by learning from past allocation decisions. The only information available to all agents are resource load and allocation success information from past resource allocations. Additional resource load information about servers is not disseminated. The basic concept of our solution is inspired by inductive reasoning and bounded rationality introduced by W. Brian Arthur [2]. The proposed mechanism does not require a central controlling authority, resource management layer or introduce additional communication between agents to decide which task is allocated on which server. We demonstrate that this mechanism performs well dynamic systems with a large number of tasks and can easily be adapted to various system sizes. In addition, the overall system performance is not affected in case agents or servers fail or become unavailable. The proposed approach provides an easy way to implement distributed resource allocation and takes into account multi-agent system tendencies toward autonomy, heterogeneity and unreliability of resources and agents. This proposed technique can be easily supplemented by techniques for queuing or rejecting resource allocation requests of agents [11]. Such self-managing capabilities of software agents allow a reliable resource allocation even in an environment with unreliable resource providers. This can be achieved by the mutual interactions between agents by applying techniques from complex system theory. Selforganisation of all agents leads to a self-organisation of the 74 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS system resources and is an emergent property of the system [21]. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section gives an overview of the related work already done in the area of load balancing, resource allocation or scheduling. Section 3 describes the model of a multi-agent environment that was used to conduct simulations for a performance evaluation. Sections 4 and 5 describe the distributed resource allocation algorithm and presents various experimental results. A summary, conclusion and outlook to future work finish this paper. 2. RELATED WORK Resource allocation is an important problem in the area of computer science. Over the past years, solutions based on different assumptions and constraints have been proposed by different research groups [7, 3, 15, 10]. Generally speaking, resource allocation is a mechanism or policy for the efficient and effective management of the access to a limited resource or set of resources by its consumers. In the simplest case, resource consumers ask a central broker or dispatcher for available resources where the resource consumer will be allocated. The broker usually has full knowledge about all system resources. All incoming requests are directed to the broker who is the solely decision maker. In those approaches, the resource consumer cannot influence the allocation decision process. Load balancing [3] is a special case of the resource allocation problem using a broker that tries to be fair to all resources by balancing the system load equally among all resource providers. This mechanism works best in a homogeneous system. A simple distributed technique for resource management is capacity planning by refusing or queuing incoming agents to avoid resource overload [11]. From the resource owner perspective, this technique is important to prevent overload at the resource but it is not sufficient for effective resource allocation. This technique can only provide a good supplement for distributed resource allocation mechanisms. Most of todays techniques for resource allocation in grid computing toolkits like Globus [12] or Condor-G [13] coordinate the resource allocation with an auctioneer, arbitrator, dispatcher, scheduler or manager. Those coordinators usually need to have global knowledge on the state of all system resources. An example of a dynamic resource allocation algorithm is the Cactus project [1] for the allocation of computational very expensive jobs. The value of distributed solutions for the resource allocation problem has been recognised by research [10]. Inspired by the principles in stock markets, economic market models have been developed for trading resources for the regulation of supply and demand in the grid. These approaches use different pricing strategies such as posted price models, different auction methods or a commodity market model. Users try to purchase cheap resources required to run the job while providers try to make as much profit as possible and operate the available resources at full capacity. A collection of different distributed resource allocation techniques based on market models is presented in Clearwater [10]. Buyya et al. developed a resource allocation framework based on the regulation of supply and demand [4] for Nimrod-G [6] with the main focus on job deadlines and budget constraints. The Agent based Resource Allocation Model (ARAM) for grids is designed to schedule computational expensive jobs using agents. Drawback of this model is the extensive use of message exchange between agents for periodic monitoring and information exchange within the hierarchical structure. Subtasks of a job migrate through the network until they find a resource that meets the price constraints. The jobs migration itinerary is determined by the resources in connecting them in different topologies [17]. The proposed mechanism in this paper eliminates the need of periodic information exchange about resource loads and does not need a connection topology between the resources. There has been considerable work on decentralised resource allocation techniques using game theory published over recent years. Most of them are formulated as repetitive games in an idealistic and simplified environment. For example, Arthur [2] introduced the so called El Farol bar problem that does not allow a perfect, logical and rational solution. It is an ill-defined decision problem that assumes and models inductive reasoning. It is probably one of the most studied examples of complex adaptive systems derived from the human way of deciding ill-defined problems. A variation of the El Farol problem is the so called minority game [8]. In this repetitive decision game, an odd number of agents have to choose between two resources based on past success information trying to allocate itself at the resource with the minority. Galstyan et al. [14] studied a variation with more than two resources, changing resource capacities and information from neighbour agents. They showed that agents can adapt effectively to changing capacities in this environment using a set of simple look-up tables (strategies) per agent. Another distributed technique that is employed for solving the resource allocation problem is based on reinforcement learning [18]. Similar to our approach, a set of agents compete for a limited number of resources based only on prior individual experience. In this paper, the system objective is to maximise system throughput while ensuring fairness to resources, measured as the average processing time per job unit. A resource allocation approach for sensor networks based on self-organisation techniques and reinforcement learning is presented in [16] with main focus on the optimisation of energy consumption of network nodes. We [19] proposed a self-organising load balancing approach for a single server with focus on optimising the communication costs of mobile agents. A mobile agent will reject a migration to a remote agent server, if it expects the destination server to be already overloaded by other agents or server tasks. Agents make their decisions themselves based on forecasts of the server utilisation. In this paper a solution for a multi-server environment is presented without consideration of communication or migration costs. 3. MODEL DESCRIPTION We model a distributed multi-agent system as a network of servers L = {l1, . . . , lm}, agents A = {a1, . . . , an} and tasks T = {T1, ..., Tm}. Each agent has a number of tasks Ti that needs to be executed during its lifetime. A task Ti requires U(Ti, t) resources for its execution at time t independent from its execution server. Resources for the execution of tasks are provided by each server li. The tasks execution location in general is specified by the map L : T ×t → L. An agent has to know about the existence of server resources in order to allocate tasks at those resources. We write LS (ai) The Sixth Intl.

Resources in the system can be used by all agents for the execution of tasks. The amount of provided resources C(li, t) of each server can vary over time. The resource utilisation of a server li at time t is calculated using equation 1, by adding the resource consumption U(Tj, t) of each task Tj that is executed at the resource at time t. All resource units used in our model represent real metrics such as memory or processor cycles. U(li, t) = n j=1 U(Tj, t)| L(Tj, t) = li (1) Additional to the case that the total amount of system resources is enough to execute all tasks, we are also interested in the case that not enough system resources are provided to fulfil all allocation requests. That is, the overall shared resource capacity is lower than the amount of requested resources by agents. In this case, some agents must wait with their allocation request until free resources are expected. The multi-agent system model used for our simulations is illustrated in Fig. 1. 4. SELF-ORGANISING RESOURCE ALLOCATION The resource allocation algorithm as described in this section is integrated in each agent. The only information required in order to make a resource allocation decision for a task is the server utilisation from completed task allocations at those servers. There is no additional information dissemination about server resource utilisation or information about free resources. Our solution demonstrates that agents can self-organise in a dynamic environment without active monitoring information that causes a lot of network traffic overhead. Additionally, we do not have any central controlling authority. All behaviour that leads to the resource allocation is created by the effective competition of the agents for shared resources and is a purely emergent effect. The agents in our multi-agent system compete for resources or a set of resources to execute tasks. The collective action of these agents change the environment and, as time goes by, they have to adapt to these changes to compete more effectively in the newly created environment. Our approach is based on different agent beliefs, represented by predictors and different information about their environment. Agents prefer a task allocation at a server with free resources. However, there is no way to be sure of the amount of free server resources in advance. All agents have the same preferences and a agent will allocate a task on a server if it expects enough free resources for its execution. There is no communication between agents. Actions taken by agents influence the actions of other agents indirectly. The applied mechanism is inspired by inductive reasoning and bounded rationality principles [2]. It is derived from the human way of deciding ill-defined problems. Humans tend to keep in mind many hypotheses and act on the most plausible one. Therefore, each agent keeps track of the performance of a private collection of its predictors and selects the one that is currently most promising for decision making. 4.1 Resource Allocation Algorithm This section describes the decision mechanism for our selforganising resource allocation. All necessary control is integrated in the agents themselves. There is no higher controlling authority, management layer for decision support or information distribution. All agents have a set of predictors for each resource to forecast the future resource utilisation of these servers for potential task allocation. To do so, agents use historical information from past task allocations at those resources. Based on the forecasted resource utilisation, the agent will make its resource allocation decision. After the task has finished its execution and returned the results back to the agent, the predictor performances are evaluated and history information is updated. Algorithm 1 shows the resource allocation algorithm for each agent. The agent first predicts the next steps resource load for each server with historical information (line 3-7). If the predicted resource load plus the tasks resource consumption is below the last known server capacity, this server is added to the list of candidates for the allocation. The agent then evaluates if any free shared resources for the task allocation are expected. In the case, no free resources are expected (line 9), the agent will explore resources by allocating the task at a randomly selected server from all not predictable servers to gather resource load information. This is the standard case at the beginning of the agent life-cycle as there is no information about the environment available. The resource load prediction itself uses a set of r predictors P(a, l) := {pi|1 ≤ i ≤ r} per server. One predictor pA ∈ P of each set is called active predictor, which forecasts the next steps resource load. Each predictor is a function P : H → ℵ+ ∪ {0} from the space of history data H to a non-negative integer, which is the forecasted value. For example, a predictor could forecast a resource load equal to the average amount of occupied resources during the last execution at this resource. A history H of resource load information is a list of up to m history items hi = (xi, yi), comprising the observation date xi and the observed value yi. The most recent history item is h0. Hm(li) = ((x0, y0), ..., (xk, yk))| 0 ≤ k < m (2) Our algorithm uses a set of predictors rather than only one, to avoid that all agents make the same decision based on the predicted value leading to an invalidation of their beliefs. Imagine that only one shared resource is known by a number of agents using one predictor forecasting the 76 The Sixth Intl.

All agents that allocated a task at a server that was slightly overloaded would dismiss another allocation at this server as they expect the server to be overloaded again based on the predictions. As the result, the server would have a large amount of free resources. A set of different predictors that predict different values avoids this situation of invalidating the beliefs of the agents [19]. An example of a collected resource load information from the last 5 visits of an agent at a shared resource can be seen in Fig. 2(a). It shows that the resource was visited frequently, which means free resources for execution were available and an exploration of other servers was unnecessary. This may change in the future as the resource load has significantly increased recently. In the case where the set of servers predicted having free resources available is not empty (line 13), the agent selects one of those for allocation. We have implemented two alternative algorithms for the selection of a server for the task allocation. Algorithm 1 Resource Allocation algorithm of an agent 1 L ← ∅ //server with free resources 2 u ← U(T, t + 1) //task resource consumption 3 for all P(a, l)|l ∈ LS (a) do 4 U(l) ← resourceLoadPrediction(P(a, l), t + 1) 5 if U(l) + u ≤ C(l) then 6 L ← L ∪ {P(a, l)} 7 end if 8 end for 9 if L = ∅ then 10 //all unpredictable shared resources 11 E ← LS /{l ∈ LS (a)|P(a, l) ∈ L} 12 allocationServer ← a random element of E 13 else 14 allocationServer ← serverSelection (L) 15 end if 16 return allocationServer Algorithm 2 shows the first method, which is a non-deterministic selection according to the predictability of the server resource utilisation. A probability distribution is calculated from the confidence levels of the resource predictions. The confidence level depends on three factors: the accuracy of the active predictor, the amount of historical information about the server and the average age of the history information (see Eq. 3. The server with the highest confidence level has the biggest chance to be selected as the active server. G(P) = w1 · size(H) m + w2 · Age(H) max Age(H) + w3 · g(p) max (g(p)) (3) where: wi − weights size(H) − number of data in history m − maximal number of history values Age(H) − average age of historical data g(p) − see eq. 4 Algorithm 2 serverSelection(L)- best predictable server 1 for all P(a, l) ∈ L do 2 calculate G(P) 3 end for 4 transform all G(P) into a probability distribution 5 return l ∈ LS selected according to the probability distribution Algorithm 3 serverSelection(L) - most free resources 1 for all P(a, l) ∈ L do 2 c(l) ← C(l) − Ul 3 end for 4 return l ∈ LS |c(l) is maximum The second alternative selection method of a server from the set of predicted servers with free resources is deterministic and shown in algorithm 3. The server with most expected free resources from the set L of server with expected free resources is chosen. In the case where all agents predict the most free resources for one particular server, all agents will allocate the task at this server, which would invalidate the agents beliefs. However, our experiments show that different individual history information and the non-deterministic active predictor selection usually prevent this situation. In the case, the resource allocation algorithm does not return any server (Alg. 1, line 16), the allocation at a resource in not recommended. The agent will not allocate the task at a resource. This case happens only if a resource load prediction for all servers is possible but no free resources are expected. After the agent execution has finished, the evaluation process described in algorithm 4 is preformed. This process is divided into three cases. First, the task was not allocated at a resource. In this case, the agent cannot decide if the decision not to allocate the task was correct or not. The agent then removes old historical data. This is necessary for a successful adaptation in the future. If the agent would not delete old historical information, the prediction would always forecast that no free resources are available. The agent would never allocate a task at one of the resources in the future. Old historical information is removed from the agents resource history using a decay rate. The decay rate is a cumulative distribution function that calculates the probability that a history item is deleted after it has reached a certain The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 77 Age of the history data Decayrate 0 1 older Figure 3: Decay rate of historical information age. The current implementation uses a constant probability density function in a configurable domain. Figure 3 shows an example of such a cumulative distribution function for the decay rate. Depending on the environment, the probability density function must be altered. If the number of potential server per agent is high, historical information must be kept longer to avoid the exploration of unexplored resources. In addition, a dynamic environment requires more up-to-date information to make more reliable predictions. The second case in the evaluation process (Alg. 4, line 5) describes the actions taken after a server was visited the first time. The agent creates a new predictor set for this server and records the historical information. All predictors for this set are chosen randomly from some predefined set. g(p) = l i=0 ri (4) where: ri = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1 if ith correct decision 0 if ith unknown outcome −1 if ith wrong decision The general case (Alg. 4, line 8) is the evaluation after the agent allocated the task at a resource. The agent evaluates all predictors of the predictor set for this resource by predicting the resource load with all predictors based on the old historical data. Predictors that made a correct prediction meaning the resource allocation was correct, will receive a positive rating. This is the case that the resource was not overloaded and free resources for execution were predicted, or the resource was overloaded and this predictor would have prevented the allocation. All predictors that predicted values which would lead to wrong decisions will receive negative ratings. In all other cases, which includes that no prediction was possible, a neutral rating is given to the predictors. Based on these performance ratings, the confidence levels are calculated using equation 4. The confidence for all predictors that cannot predict with the current historical information about the server is set to zero to prevent the selection of those as the new active predictor. These values are transformed into a probability distribution. According to this probability distribution the new active predictor is chosen, implemented as a roulette wheel selection. Figure 2(b) illustrates the probabilities of a set of 10 predictors, which have been calculated from the predictor confidence levels. Even if predictor 9 has the highest selection probability, its was not chosen by roulette wheel selection process as the active predictor. This non-deterministic predictor selection prevents the invalidation of the agents beliefs in case agents have the same set of predictors. The prediction accuracy that is the error of the prediction compared to the observed value is not taken into consideration. Suppose the active predictor predicts slightly above the resource capacity which leads not to a allocation on a resources. In fact, enough resources for the execution would be available. A less accurate prediction which is far below the capacity would lead to the correct decision and is therefore preferred. The last action of the evaluation algorithm (Alg. 4, line 22) updates the history with the latest resource load information of the server. The oldest history data is overwritten if already m history values are recorded for the server.

This method assures that agents can compete more effectively in a changing environment. Different types of predictors are suitable for different situations and environments. Therefore, all predictors are being evaluated after each decision and the active predictor is selected. This nondeterministic of the new active predictor supports that the agents beliefs will not be invalidated, which happens in the case that all predictors are making the same decision. Especially if there is only one shared resource available and all agents have only the choice to go the this one shared resource or not [19]. Our self-organising approach is robust against failures of resources or agents in the system. If they join or leave, the system can self-organise quickly and adapts to the new conditions. There is no classical bottleneck or single point of failure like in centralised mechanisms. The limitations are the reliance on historical resource utilisation information about other servers. A forecast of the resource utilisation of a remote server is only possible if an agent has a number of historical information about a shared resource. If the number of servers per agent is very large, there is no efficient way to gather historical information about remote servers. This problem occurs if the amount of provided shared resources 78 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) is limited and not enough for all resource consumers. In this case, the an agent would randomly try all known servers until it will find one with free resources or there is no one. In the worst case, by the time for trying all servers, historical information of the servers is already outdated. 5. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION The first part of this section gives a short overview of the setup of our simulation environment. In the rest of the section, results of the experiments are presented and discussed. All experiments are conducted in a special testbed that simulates and models a multi-agent system. We have implemented this test-bed in the Java programming language, independent from any specific agent toolkit. It allows a variety of experiments in in stable as well as dynamic environments with a configurable number of agents, tasks and servers. An event-driven model is used to trigger all activities in the system. For all simulations, we limited the number of history data for each server to 10, the number of performance ratings per predictor to 10 and assigned 10 predictors to every predictor set for each agent. All predictors are chosen randomly from a arbitrary predefined set of 32 predictors of the following type. Predictors differ in different cycles or window sizes. - n-cycle predictor: p(n) = yn uses the nth -last history value - n-mean predictor: p(n) = 1 n · n i=1 yi uses the mean value of the n-last history values - n-linear regression predictor: p(n, t) = a·t+b uses the linear regression value from the last n history values where a, b are calculated using linear regression with least squares fitting under consideration of the last n history data. - n-distribution predictor: uses a random value from the frequency distribution of the n last history values - n-mirror predictor: p(n) = 2 · H − yn uses the mirror image around the mean of all history values of the nth last history value The efficiency of our proposed self-organising resource allocation is assessed by the resource load development of each server over the simulation as well as the total resource load development cumulated over all shared resources. Resource loads for each server are calculated using equation 1 as the sum of the resource consumption of all currently executed agents at this server. The total resource load of the system is calculated as the sum of the resources load of all resources. The self-organising resource allocation algorithm has random elements. Therefore, the presented results show mean values and standard derivation calculated over 100 repeated experiments. 5.1 Experimental Setup The following parameters have an impact on the resource allocation process. We give an overview of the parameters and a short description. - Agents: The number of agents involved in the resource allocation. This number varies in the experiments between 650 and 750 dependent on the total amount of available system resources. - Resource consumption: Each task consumes server resources for its execution. The resource consumption is assigned randomly to each task prior to its allocation from an interval. Resource consumption is specified in resource units which corresponds to real world metrics like memory or processor cycles. - Agent home server: All agents are located on a home agent server. The resources of those servers not considered in our simulation and does not affect the resource allocation performance. - Server resources: Experiments use servers with different amount of available shared resources. The first experiment is conducted in a static server environment that provides the same amount of shared resources, while the other experiment varies the available server resource during the simulation. The total amount of resources remains constant in both experiments. - Execution time: The execution time of a task for the execution, independent from the execution platform. For this time the task consumes the assigned amount of server resources. This parameter is randomly assigned before the execution. - Task creation time: The time before the next task is created after successful or unsuccessful completion. This parameter influences the age of the historical information about resources and has a major influence on the length of the initial adaptation phase. This parameter is randomly assigned after the task was completed. 5.2 Experimental Results This section shows results from selected experiments that demonstrate the performance of our proposed resource allocation mechanism. The first experiment show the performance in a stable environment where a number of agents allocate tasks to servers that provide a constant amount of resources. The second experiment was conducted in a dynamic server environment with a constant number of agents. The first experiment shows our model in a stable 3-server environment that provide a total amount of 7000 resource units. The resource capacity of each server remains constant over the experiment. We used 650 agents with the parameters of the execution time between 1 and 15 time units and a task creation time in the interval [0 − 30] time units. The tasks resource consumption is randomly assigned from the interval [1 − 45] resource units. Figure 4 shows the results from 100 repetitions of this experiment. Figure 4(a) shows that the total amount of provided resources is larger than the demand of resource in average. At the beginning of the experiment, all agents allocate their tasks randomly at one of the available servers and explore the available capacities and resource utilisations for about 150 time units. This initial exploration phase shows that the average resource load of each server has a similar level. This causes an overload situation at server 1 because of its low capacity of shared resources, and a large amount of free resources on server 2. Agents that allocated tasks to server 1 detect the overload situation and explore randomly other available servers. They find free resources at server 2. After learning period, the agents have self-organised themselves in this stable environment and find a stable solution for the allocation of The Sixth Intl.

The standard deviation of the resource loads are small for each server, which indicates that our distributed approach find stable solutions in almost every run. This experiment used algorithm 2 for the selection of the active server. We also ran the same experiment with the most free resources selection mechanism to select the active server. The resource allocation for each server is similar. The absolute amount of free resources per server is almost the same. Experiment 2 was conducted in a dynamic 3-server environment with a number of 750 agents. The amount of resources of server 0 and server 1 changes periodically, while the total amount of available resources remains constant. Server 0 has an initial capacity of 1000 units, server 1 start with a capacity of 4000 units. The change in capacity starts after 150 time units, which is approximately the end of the learning phase. Figure 5 (b, c, d) shows the behaviour of our self-organising resource allocation in this environment. All agents use the deterministic most free resources selection mechanism to select the active server. It can bee seen in Fig. 5(b) and 5(c) that the number of allocated resources to server 0 and server 1 changes periodically with the amount of provided resources. This shows that agents can sense available resources in this dynamic environment and are able to adapt to those changes. The resource load development of server 2 (see Fig. 5(d)) shows a periodic change because some agent try to be allocated tasks to this server in case their previously favoured server reduce the amount of shared resources. The total resource load of all shared resources is constant over the experiments, which indicates the all agents allocate their tasks to one of the shared resource (comp. Fig. 4(a)). 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper a self-organising distributed resource allocation technique for multi-agent systems was presented. We enable agents to select the execution platform for their tasks themselves before each execution at run-time. In our approach the agents compete for an allocation at one of the 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 Time 0 2,500 5,000 7,500 ResourceLoad (a) Total resource load versus total shared resource capacity 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 Time 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 ResourceLoad (b) Resource load server 1 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 Time 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 ResourceLoad (c) Resource load server 2 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 Time 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 ResourceLoad (d) Resource load server 3 Figure 5: Results of experiment 2 in a dynamic server environment averaged over 100 repetitions. available shared resource. Agents sense their server environment and adopt their action to compete more efficient in the new created environment. This process is adaptive and has a strong feedback as allocation decisions influence indirectly decisions of other agents. The resource allocation is a purely emergent effect. Our mechanism demonstrates that resource allocation can be done by the effective competition of individual and autonomous agents. Neither do they need coordination or information from a higher authority nor is an additional direct communication between agents required. This mechanism was inspired by inductive reasoning and bounded rationality principles which enables the agents adaptation of their strategies to compete effectively in a dynamic environment. In the case of a server becomes unavailable, the agents can adapt quickly to this new situation by exploring new resources or remain at the home server if an allocation is not possible. Especially in dynamic and scalable environments such as grid systems, a robust and distributed mechanism for resource allocation is required. Our self-organising resource allocation approach was evaluated with a number of simulation experiments in a dynamic environment of agents and server resources. The presented results for this new approach for strategic migration optimisation are very promising and justify further investigation in a real multi-agent system environment. It is a distributed, scalable and easy-to-understand policy for the regulation of supply and demand of resources. All control is implemented in the agents. A simple decision mechanism based on different beliefs of the agent creates an emergent behaviour that leads to effective resource allocation. This approach can be easily extended or supported by resource balancing/queuing mechanisms provided by resources. Our approach adapts to changes in the environment but it is not evolutionary. There is no discovery of new strategies by the agents. The set of predictors stays the same over the whole life. In fact, we believe that this could further improve the systems behaviour over a long term period and could be 80 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) investigated in the future. The evolution would be very slow and selective and will not influence the system behaviour in a short-term period that is covered by our experimental results. In the near future we will investigate if an automatic adaptation of the decay rate of historical information our algorithm is possible and can improve the resource allocation performance. The decay rate is currently predefined and must be altered manually depending on the environment. A large number of shared resources requires older historical information to avoid a too frequently resources exploration. In contrast, a dynamic environment with varying capacities requires more up-to-date information to make more reliable predictions. We are aware of the long learning phase in environments with a large number of shared resources known by each agent. In the case that more resources are requested by agents than shared resources are provided by all servers, all agents will randomly explore all known servers. This process of acquiring resource load information about all servers can take a long time in the case that no not enough shared resources for all tasks are provided. In the worst case, by the time for exploring all servers, historical information of some servers could be already outdated and the exploration starts again. In this situation, it is difficult for an agent to efficiently gather historical information about all remote servers. This issue needs more investigation in the future. 7. REFERENCES [1] G.

Estas técnicas deben tener en cuenta la heterogeneidad y la posible falta de fiabilidad de los recursos y los consumidores de recursos en entornos distribuidos. En este artículo proponemos un algoritmo distribuido que resuelva el problema de asignación de recursos en sistemas multiagentes distribuidos. Nuestra solución se basa en la autoorganización de los agentes, que no requiere ningún facilitador o capa de gestión. La asignación de recursos en el sistema es un efecto puramente emergente.

Introducción Con la creciente popularidad de las tecnologías informáticas distribuidas como la red [12] y los servicios web [20], Internet se está convirtiendo en una poderosa plataforma informática donde diferentes pares de software (por ejemplo, agentes) pueden usar recursos informáticos existentes para realizar tareas. En este sentido, cada agente es un consumidor de recursos que adquiere una cierta cantidad de recursos para la ejecución de sus tareas. Es difícil para un mecanismo de asignación de recursos centrales recopilar y administrar la información sobre todos los recursos compartidos y los consumidores de recursos para realizar efectivamente la asignación de recursos. Por lo tanto, se requieren soluciones distribuidas del problema de asignación de recursos. Los investigadores han reconocido estos requisitos [10] y técnicas propuestas para la asignación de recursos distribuidos. Un tipo prometedor de enfoques distribuidos se basa en modelos de mercado económico [4], inspirados en principios de los mercados de valores reales. Incluso si esos enfoques se distribuyen, generalmente requieren un facilitador para los precios, el descubrimiento de recursos y el envío de trabajos a recursos [5, 9]. Otro problema principalmente sin resolver de esos enfoques es el ajuste de precios y tiempo, limitaciones presupuestarias para permitir una asignación eficiente de recursos en sistemas grandes y dinámicos [22]. En este artículo proponemos una solución distribuida del problema de asignación de recursos basado en la autoorganización de los consumidores de recursos en un sistema con recursos limitados. En nuestro enfoque, los agentes asignan dinámicamente tareas a servidores que proporcionan una cantidad limitada de recursos. En nuestro enfoque, los agentes seleccionan de forma autónoma la plataforma de ejecución para la tarea en lugar de pedirle a un corredor de recursos que realice la asignación. Todo el control necesario para nuestro algoritmo se distribuye entre los agentes del sistema. Optimizan el proceso de asignación de recursos continuamente durante su vida a los cambios en la disponibilidad de recursos compartidos al aprender de las decisiones de asignación pasadas. La única información disponible para todos los agentes es la información de éxito de recursos y la asignación de la información de éxito de las asignaciones de recursos pasados. La información de carga de recursos adicional sobre los servidores no se difunde. El concepto básico de nuestra solución está inspirado en el razonamiento inductivo y la racionalidad limitada introducida por W. Brian Arthur [2]. El mecanismo propuesto no requiere una autoridad de control central, una capa de gestión de recursos o introducir comunicación adicional entre los agentes para decidir qué tarea se asigna en qué servidor. Demostramos que este mecanismo realiza sistemas dinámicos bien con una gran cantidad de tareas y se puede adaptar fácilmente a varios tamaños del sistema. Además, el rendimiento general del sistema no se ve afectado en caso de que los agentes o servidores fallen o no estén disponibles. El enfoque propuesto proporciona una manera fácil de implementar la asignación distribuida de recursos y tiene en cuenta las tendencias del sistema múltiple hacia la autonomía, la heterogeneidad y la falta de fiabilidad de los recursos y los agentes. Esta técnica propuesta puede complementarse fácilmente mediante técnicas para hacer cola o rechazar las solicitudes de asignación de recursos de los agentes [11]. Dichas capacidades de autogestión de los agentes de software permiten una asignación confiable de recursos incluso en un entorno con proveedores de recursos poco confiables. Esto se puede lograr mediante las interacciones mutuas entre los agentes aplicando técnicas de la teoría del sistema complejo. La autoorganización de todos los agentes conduce a una autoorganización de los 74 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS System Resources y es una propiedad emergente del sistema [21]. El resto del documento está estructurado de la siguiente manera: la siguiente sección ofrece una visión general del trabajo relacionado ya realizado en el área de equilibrio de carga, asignación de recursos o programación. La Sección 3 describe el modelo de un entorno de múltiples agentes que se utilizó para realizar simulaciones para una evaluación de rendimiento. Las secciones 4 y 5 describen el algoritmo de asignación de recursos distribuidos y presenta varios resultados experimentales. Un resumen, conclusión y perspectiva para el trabajo futuro terminan este documento.2. La asignación de recursos laborales relacionados es un problema importante en el área de la informática. En los últimos años, los diferentes grupos de investigación han propuesto soluciones basadas en diferentes supuestos y restricciones [7, 3, 15, 10]. En términos generales, la asignación de recursos es un mecanismo o política para la gestión eficiente y efectiva del acceso a un recurso limitado o un conjunto de recursos por parte de sus consumidores. En el caso más simple, los consumidores de recursos solicitan a un corredor o despachador central los recursos disponibles donde se asignará al consumidor de recursos. El corredor generalmente tiene pleno conocimiento sobre todos los recursos del sistema. Todas las solicitudes entrantes están dirigidas al corredor que es el único tomador de decisiones. En esos enfoques, el consumidor de recursos no puede influir en el proceso de decisión de asignación. El equilibrio de carga [3] es un caso especial del problema de asignación de recursos utilizando un corredor que intenta ser justo con todos los recursos al equilibrar la carga del sistema por igual entre todos los proveedores de recursos. Este mecanismo funciona mejor en un sistema homogéneo. Una técnica distribuida simple para la gestión de recursos es la planificación de la capacidad al rechazar o hacer cola a los agentes entrantes para evitar la sobrecarga de recursos [11]. Desde la perspectiva del propietario de los recursos, esta técnica es importante para evitar la sobrecarga en el recurso, pero no es suficiente para una asignación efectiva de recursos. Esta técnica solo puede proporcionar un buen suplemento para los mecanismos de asignación de recursos distribuidos. La mayoría de las técnicas de hoy para la asignación de recursos en los kits de herramientas de computación de la red como Globus [12] o Condor-G [13] coordinan la asignación de recursos con un subastador, árbitro, despachador, programador o gerente. Esos coordinadores generalmente necesitan tener conocimiento global sobre el estado de todos los recursos del sistema. Un ejemplo de un algoritmo de asignación de recursos dinámicos es el proyecto Cactus [1] para la asignación de trabajos computacionales muy caros. La investigación ha reconocido el valor de las soluciones distribuidas para el problema de asignación de recursos [10]. Inspirados por los principios en los mercados de valores, se han desarrollado modelos de mercado económico para la negociación de recursos para la regulación de la oferta y la demanda en la red. Estos enfoques utilizan diferentes estrategias de precios, como modelos de precios publicados, diferentes métodos de subastas o un modelo de mercado de productos básicos. Los usuarios intentan comprar recursos baratos necesarios para ejecutar el trabajo, mientras que los proveedores intentan obtener la mayor cantidad de ganancias posible y operar los recursos disponibles a plena capacidad. Una colección de diferentes técnicas de asignación de recursos distribuidos basadas en modelos de mercado se presenta en Clearwater [10]. Buyya et al.desarrolló un marco de asignación de recursos basado en la regulación de la oferta y la demanda [4] para Nimrod-G [6] con el enfoque principal en los plazos de trabajo y las limitaciones presupuestarias. El Modelo de asignación de recursos basado en agentes (ARAM) para cuadrículas está diseñado para programar trabajos computacionales costosos utilizando agentes. El inconveniente de este modelo es el uso extenso del intercambio de mensajes entre agentes para el monitoreo periódico y el intercambio de información dentro de la estructura jerárquica. Las subtareas de un trabajo migran a través de la red hasta que encuentran un recurso que cumpla con las limitaciones de precios. El itinerario de migración de empleos está determinado por los recursos para conectarlos en diferentes topologías [17]. El mecanismo propuesto en este documento elimina la necesidad de un intercambio de información periódico sobre las cargas de recursos y no necesita una topología de conexión entre los recursos. Ha habido un trabajo considerable sobre técnicas descentralizadas de asignación de recursos utilizando la teoría de juegos publicada en los últimos años. La mayoría de ellos están formulados como juegos repetitivos en un entorno idealista y simplificado. Por ejemplo, Arthur [2] introdujo el llamado problema de la barra de El Farol que no permite una solución perfecta, lógica y racional. Es un problema de decisión mal definido que asume y modela el razonamiento inductivo. Es probablemente uno de los ejemplos más estudiados de sistemas adaptativos complejos derivados de la forma humana de decidir problemas mal definidos. Una variación del problema de El Farol es el llamado juego minoritario [8]. En este juego de decisión repetitivo, un número impar de agentes debe elegir entre dos recursos basados en la información de éxito pasada que intenta asignarse en el recurso con la minoría. Galstyan et al.[14] estudiaron una variación con más de dos recursos, cambiando las capacidades de recursos e información de los agentes vecinos. Mostraron que los agentes pueden adaptarse de manera efectiva a las capacidades cambiantes en este entorno utilizando un conjunto de tablas de búsqueda (estrategias) simples por agente. Otra técnica distribuida que se emplea para resolver el problema de asignación de recursos se basa en el aprendizaje de refuerzo [18]. Similar a nuestro enfoque, un conjunto de agentes compiten por un número limitado de recursos basados solo en experiencia individual previa. En este documento, el objetivo del sistema es maximizar el rendimiento del sistema al tiempo que garantiza la equidad con los recursos, medido como el tiempo de procesamiento promedio por unidad de trabajo. En [16] se presenta un enfoque de asignación de recursos para redes de sensores basado en técnicas de autoorganización y aprendizaje de refuerzo con el enfoque principal en la optimización del consumo de energía de los nodos de red. [19] propusimos un enfoque de equilibrio de carga autoorganizado para un solo servidor con enfoque en optimizar los costos de comunicación de los agentes móviles. Un agente móvil rechazará una migración a un servidor de agente remoto, si espera que el servidor de destino ya esté sobrecargado por otros agentes o tareas del servidor. Los agentes toman sus decisiones por sí mismos en función de los pronósticos de la utilización del servidor. En este documento, se presenta una solución para un entorno de servidor múltiple sin tener en cuenta los costos de comunicación o migración.3. Descripción del modelo Modelo Un sistema distribuido de múltiples agentes como una red de servidores l = {L1 ,..., lm}, agentes a = {a1 ,..., an} y tareas t = {t1, ..., tm}. Cada agente tiene una serie de tareas TI que deben ejecutarse durante su vida. Una tarea TI requiere recursos U (Ti, T) para su ejecución en el momento t independiente de su servidor de ejecución. Los recursos para la ejecución de tareas son proporcionados por cada servidor LI. La ubicación de ejecución de tareas en general es especificada por el mapa L: T × T → L. Un agente debe saber sobre la existencia de recursos del servidor para asignar tareas a esos recursos. Escribimos ls (ai) el sexto intl.

Los recursos en el sistema pueden ser utilizados por todos los agentes para la ejecución de tareas. La cantidad de recursos proporcionados C (Li, T) de cada servidor puede variar con el tiempo. La utilización de recursos de un servidor LI en el momento t se calcula utilizando la Ecuación 1, agregando el consumo de recursos u (TJ, t) de cada tarea TJ que se ejecuta en el recurso en el momento t.Todas las unidades de recursos utilizadas en nuestro modelo representan métricas reales, como los ciclos de memoria o procesador. U (li, t) = n j = 1 u (tj, t) |L (tj, t) = li (1) adicional al caso de que la cantidad total de recursos del sistema es suficiente para ejecutar todas las tareas, también estamos interesados en el caso de que no se proporcionen suficientes recursos del sistema para cumplir con todas las solicitudes de asignación. Es decir, la capacidad general de recursos compartidos es menor que la cantidad de recursos solicitados por los agentes. En este caso, algunos agentes deben esperar con su solicitud de asignación hasta que se esperen recursos gratuitos. El modelo de sistema de múltiples agentes utilizado para nuestras simulaciones se ilustra en la Fig. 1. 4. Asignación de recursos autoorganizantes El algoritmo de asignación de recursos como se describe en esta sección se integra en cada agente. La única información requerida para tomar una decisión de asignación de recursos para una tarea es la utilización del servidor a partir de asignaciones de tareas completadas en esos servidores. No existe una difusión de información adicional sobre la utilización de recursos del servidor o la información sobre los recursos gratuitos. Nuestra solución demuestra que los agentes pueden autoorganizarse en un entorno dinámico sin información de monitoreo activo que causa una gran cantidad de sobrecarga de tráfico de red. Además, no tenemos ninguna autoridad de control central. Todo el comportamiento que conduce a la asignación de recursos es creado por la competencia efectiva de los agentes para los recursos compartidos y es un efecto puramente emergente. Los agentes en nuestro sistema de múltiples agentes compiten por recursos o un conjunto de recursos para ejecutar tareas. La acción colectiva de estos agentes cambia el entorno y, a medida que pasa el tiempo, tienen que adaptarse a estos cambios para competir de manera más efectiva en el entorno recién creado. Nuestro enfoque se basa en diferentes creencias de agentes, representadas por predictores e información diferente sobre su entorno. Los agentes prefieren una asignación de tareas en un servidor con recursos gratuitos. Sin embargo, no hay forma de estar seguro de la cantidad de recursos gratuitos del servidor por adelantado. Todos los agentes tienen las mismas preferencias y un agente asignará una tarea en un servidor si espera suficientes recursos gratuitos para su ejecución. No hay comunicación entre los agentes. Las acciones tomadas por los agentes influyen indirectamente en las acciones de otros agentes. El mecanismo aplicado está inspirado en el razonamiento inductivo y los principios de racionalidad limitados [2]. Se deriva de la forma humana de decidir problemas mal definidos. Los humanos tienden a tener en cuenta muchas hipótesis y actúan sobre la más plausible. Por lo tanto, cada agente realiza un seguimiento del rendimiento de una colección privada de sus predictores y selecciona la que actualmente es más prometedor para la toma de decisiones.4.1 Algoritmo de asignación de recursos Esta sección describe el mecanismo de decisión para nuestra asignación de recursos de autoorganización. Todo el control necesario está integrado en los propios agentes. No existe una mayor autoridad de control, capa de gestión para el apoyo a la decisión o la distribución de información. Todos los agentes tienen un conjunto de predictores para cada recurso para pronosticar la utilización futura de recursos de estos servidores para la asignación de tareas potenciales. Para hacerlo, los agentes usan información histórica de asignaciones de tareas pasadas en esos recursos. Basado en la utilización de recursos previstas, el agente tomará su decisión de asignación de recursos. Una vez que la tarea ha terminado su ejecución y devolvió los resultados al agente, se evalúan los rendimientos predictores y se actualiza la información del historial. El algoritmo 1 muestra el algoritmo de asignación de recursos para cada agente. El agente primero predice la carga de recursos de los siguientes pasos para cada servidor con información histórica (línea 3-7). Si la carga de recursos prevista más el consumo de recursos de tareas está por debajo de la última capacidad de servidor conocida, este servidor se agrega a la lista de candidatos para la asignación. Luego, el agente evalúa si se espera algún recurso compartido gratuito para la asignación de tareas. En el caso, no se esperan recursos gratuitos (línea 9), el agente explorará los recursos asignando la tarea en un servidor seleccionado al azar de todos los servidores no predecibles para recopilar información de carga de recursos. Este es el caso estándar al comienzo del ciclo de vida del agente, ya que no hay información sobre el entorno disponible. La predicción de carga de recursos en sí utiliza un conjunto de predictores R P (A, L): = {PI | 1 ≤ I ≤ R} por servidor. Un predictor pa ∈ P de cada conjunto se llama predictor activo, que pronostica la carga de recursos de los siguientes pasos. Cada predictor es una función P: H → ℵ+ ∪ {0} Desde el espacio de los datos de la historia H a un entero no negativo, que es el valor previsto. Por ejemplo, un predictor podría pronosticar una carga de recursos igual a la cantidad promedio de recursos ocupados durante la última ejecución en este recurso. Un historial de información de carga de recursos es una lista de los elementos de Historial de hasta M HI = (XI, YI), que comprende la fecha de observación XI y el valor observado yi. El elemento de la historia más reciente es H0. Hm (li) = ((x0, y0), ..., (xk, yk)) |0 ≤ k <m (2) Nuestro algoritmo utiliza un conjunto de predictores en lugar de solo uno, para evitar que todos los agentes tomen la misma decisión basada en el valor predicho que conduce a una invalidación de sus creencias. Imagine que solo un recurso compartido es conocido por varios agentes que usan un predictor que pronostica el 76 el sexto intl.

Todos los agentes que asignaron una tarea en un servidor que estaba ligeramente sobrecargado descartaría otra asignación en este servidor, ya que esperan que el servidor se sobrecargue nuevamente en función de las predicciones. Como resultado, el servidor tendría una gran cantidad de recursos gratuitos. Un conjunto de diferentes predictores que predicen diferentes valores evita esta situación de invalidar las creencias de los agentes [19]. Un ejemplo de una información de carga de recursos recopilada de las últimas 5 visitas de un agente en un recurso compartido se puede ver en la Fig. 2 (a). Muestra que el recurso fue visitado con frecuencia, lo que significa que los recursos gratuitos para la ejecución estaban disponibles y una exploración de otros servidores era innecesaria. Esto puede cambiar en el futuro a medida que la carga de recursos ha aumentado significativamente recientemente. En el caso de que el conjunto de servidores predicho que tiene recursos gratuitos disponibles no está vacío (línea 13), el agente selecciona uno de ellos para la asignación. Hemos implementado dos algoritmos alternativos para la selección de un servidor para la asignación de tareas. Algoritmo 1 Algoritmo de asignación de recursos de un agente 1 l ← ∅ // servidor con recursos gratuitos 2 u ← u (t, t + 1) // Consumo de recursos de tareas 3 para todos los p (a, l) | l ∈ Ls (a)do 4 u (l) ← Resourceloadpredicción (p (a, l), t + 1) 5 si u (l) + u ≤ c (l) entonces 6 l ← l ∪ {p (a, l)} 7 final si8 Fin para 9 si l = ∅ entonces 10 // Todos los recursos compartidos impredecibles 11 E ← LS /{L ∈ LS (a) | P (A, L) ∈ L} 12 Allocationserver ← Un elemento aleatorio de E 13 más 14 AllocationServerver← La elección del servidor (l) 15 final si 16 algoritmo de retorno de asignación 2 muestra el primer método, que es una selección no determinista de acuerdo con la previsibilidad de la utilización de recursos del servidor. Una distribución de probabilidad se calcula a partir de los niveles de confianza de las predicciones de recursos. El nivel de confianza depende de tres factores: la precisión del predictor activo, la cantidad de información histórica sobre el servidor y la edad promedio de la información del historial (ver Ec. 3. El servidor con el nivel de confianza más alto tiene la mayor oportunidad de ser seleccionado como servidor activo. G (p) = w1 · tamaño (h) m + w2 · edad (h) máx.- Número de datos en la historia M - Número máximo de valores del historial Edad (H) - Edad promedio de los datos históricos G (P) - Ver Eq.4 Algoritmo 2 Elección de servidores (l)- Mejor servidor predecible 1 para todos p (a, l) ∈ L do 2 Calcule g (p) 3 extremo para 4 transformar todo g (p) en una distribución de probabilidad 5 return l ∈ Ls seleccionado segúnal algoritmo de distribución de probabilidad 3 selección de servidores (l): la mayoría de los recursos libres 1 para todos p (a, l) ∈ L do 2 c (l) ← c (l) - ul 3 extremo para 4 retorno l ∈ Ls | c (l) es máximo El segundo método de selección alternativa de un servidor del conjunto de servidores predichos con recursos libres es determinista y se muestra en el Algoritmo 3. Se elige el servidor con la mayoría de los recursos gratuitos esperados del Set L del servidor con los recursos gratuitos esperados. En el caso de que todos los agentes predicen los recursos más gratuitos para un servidor en particular, todos los agentes asignarán la tarea en este servidor, lo que invalidará las creencias de los agentes. Sin embargo, nuestros experimentos muestran que la información de la historia individual diferente y la selección del predictor activo no determinista generalmente impiden esta situación. En el caso, el algoritmo de asignación de recursos no devuelve ningún servidor (Alg. 1, línea 16), la asignación en un recurso no recomendado. El agente no asignará la tarea en un recurso. Este caso ocurre solo si es posible una predicción de carga de recursos para todos los servidores, pero no se esperan recursos gratuitos. Una vez que la ejecución del agente ha terminado, se realiza el proceso de evaluación descrito en el Algoritmo 4. Este proceso se divide en tres casos. Primero, la tarea no se asignó en un recurso. En este caso, el agente no puede decidir si la decisión de no asignar la tarea era correcta o no. El agente luego elimina los viejos datos históricos. Esto es necesario para una adaptación exitosa en el futuro. Si el agente no eliminara la información histórica antigua, la predicción siempre pronosticaría que no hay recursos gratuitos disponibles. El agente nunca asignaría una tarea en uno de los recursos en el futuro. La información histórica antigua se elimina del historial de recursos de los agentes utilizando una tasa de descomposición. La tasa de descomposición es una función de distribución acumulativa que calcula la probabilidad de que un elemento de historial se elimine después de que haya alcanzado un cierto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 77 Edad del historial Datos Decayrate 0 1 Figura más antigua 3: Tasa de descomposición de la edad de información histórica. La implementación actual utiliza una función de densidad de probabilidad constante en un dominio configurable. La Figura 3 muestra un ejemplo de dicha función de distribución acumulativa para la tasa de descomposición. Dependiendo del entorno, la función de densidad de probabilidad debe ser alterada. Si el número de servidor potencial por agente es alto, la información histórica debe mantenerse más tiempo para evitar la exploración de recursos inexplorados. Además, un entorno dinámico requiere información más actualizada para hacer predicciones más confiables. El segundo caso en el proceso de evaluación (Alg. 4, línea 5) describe las acciones tomadas después de que se visitó un servidor por primera vez. El agente crea un nuevo conjunto de predictor para este servidor y registra la información histórica. Todos los predictores para este conjunto se eligen al azar de algún conjunto predefinido.g (p) = l i = 0 ri (4) donde: ri = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ ⎩ 1 Si es una decisión correcta 0 si es un resultado desconocido −1 si es una decisión incorrecta, el caso general (Alg. 4, línea 8) es la evaluación después deEl agente asignó la tarea en un recurso. El agente evalúa todos los predictores del conjunto de predictor para este recurso prediciendo la carga de recursos con todos los predictores basados en los datos históricos antiguos. Los predictores que hicieron una predicción correcta, lo que significa que la asignación de recursos era correcta, recibirá una calificación positiva. Este es el caso de que el recurso no estaba sobrecargado y se predijeron recursos gratuitos para la ejecución, o el recurso se sobrecargó y este predictor habría evitado la asignación. Todos los predictores que predijeron valores que conducirían a decisiones incorrectas recibirán calificaciones negativas. En todos los demás casos, que incluyen que no fue posible predicción, se otorga una calificación neutral a los predictores. Según estas calificaciones de rendimiento, los niveles de confianza se calculan utilizando la Ecuación 4. La confianza para todos los predictores que no pueden predecir con la información histórica actual sobre el servidor se establece en cero para evitar la selección de ellos como el nuevo predictor activo. Estos valores se transforman en una distribución de probabilidad. De acuerdo con esta distribución de probabilidad, se elige el nuevo predictor activo, implementado como una selección de ruedas de ruleta. La Figura 2 (b) ilustra las probabilidades de un conjunto de 10 predictores, que se han calculado a partir de los niveles de confianza del predictor. Incluso si el predictor 9 tiene la mayor probabilidad de selección, no fue elegido por el proceso de selección de la rueda de la ruleta como predictor activo. Esta selección predictor no determinista evita la invalidación de las creencias de los agentes en el caso de que los agentes tengan el mismo conjunto de predictores. La precisión de la predicción que es el error de la predicción en comparación con el valor observado no se tiene en cuenta. Supongamos que el predictor activo predice ligeramente por encima de la capacidad de recursos que no lleva a una asignación de recursos. De hecho, suficientes recursos para la ejecución estarían disponibles. Una predicción menos precisa que está muy por debajo de la capacidad conduciría a la decisión correcta y, por lo tanto, se prefiere. La última acción del algoritmo de evaluación (Alg. 4, línea 22) actualiza el historial con la última información de carga de recursos del servidor. Los datos del historial más antiguos se sobrescriben si ya se registran los valores de Historial M para el servidor. Algoritmo 4 Evaluación de decisión 1 Si l ∈ LE entonces 2 para todos p (a, l) | l ∈ Ls (a) HACE 3 Evaporar datos históricos antiguos 4 End para 5 más si p (a, l) = nulo entonces 6 crea (P (a, l)) 7 Actualización H (l) 8 más 9 Para todas las p ∈ P (A, L) Do 10 pred ← Resourceloadpredicción (p) 11 if (u (l) ≤ c (l) y pred + u(a, t) ≤ c (l)) o (u (l)> c (l) y pred + u (a, t)> c (l)) Entonces 12 addPositiverating (p) 13 más si u (l)≤ c (l) y pred + u (a, t)> c (l) o u (l) ≤ c (l) y pred + u (a, t)> c (l) luego 14 addnegativerating (p) 15else 16 addneutrating (p) 17 final si 18 terminan para 19 calcule todo g (p);g (p) ← 0, si P no funciona 20 transforma todo G (p) en una distribución de probabilidad 21 Pa ← P ∈ P (A, L) se selecciona de acuerdo con esta Distribución de probabilidad 22 Actualización H (l) 23 Fin si4.2 Observaciones y limitación del enfoque Nuestro mecanismo de predicción utiliza varios tipos diferentes de predictores simples en lugar de un predictor sofisticado. Este método asegura que los agentes puedan competir de manera más efectiva en un entorno cambiante. Los diferentes tipos de predictores son adecuados para diferentes situaciones y entornos. Por lo tanto, todos los predictores se están evaluando después de cada decisión y se selecciona el predictor activo. Este no determinista del nuevo predictor activo respalda que las creencias de los agentes no se invalidarán, lo que ocurre en el caso de que todos los predictores están tomando la misma decisión. Especialmente si solo hay un recurso compartido disponible y todos los agentes solo tienen la opción de ir este recurso compartido o no [19]. Nuestro enfoque autoorganizado es robusto contra las fallas de recursos o agentes en el sistema. Si se unen o se van, el sistema puede autoorganizarse rápidamente y adaptarse a las nuevas condiciones. No hay un cuello de botella clásico o un único punto de falla como en mecanismos centralizados. Las limitaciones son la dependencia de la información de utilización de recursos históricos sobre otros servidores. Un pronóstico de la utilización de recursos de un servidor remoto solo es posible si un agente tiene una serie de información histórica sobre un recurso compartido. Si el número de servidores por agente es muy grande, no hay una forma eficiente de recopilar información histórica sobre servidores remotos. Este problema ocurre si la cantidad de recursos compartidos proporcionados 78 el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) es limitado y no es suficiente para todos los consumidores de recursos. En este caso, el agente un agente intentaría aleatoriamente todos los servidores conocidos hasta que encuentre uno con recursos gratuitos o no hay nadie. En el peor de los casos, para probar todos los servidores, la información histórica de los servidores ya está desactualizada.5. Evaluación experimental La primera parte de esta sección ofrece una breve descripción de la configuración de nuestro entorno de simulación. En el resto de la sección, se presentan y discuten los resultados de los experimentos. Todos los experimentos se llevan a cabo en un Bed de prueba especial que simula y modela un sistema de múltiples agentes. Hemos implementado este lecho de prueba en el lenguaje de programación de Java, independientemente de cualquier kit de herramientas de agente específico. Permite una variedad de experimentos en entornos estables y dinámicos con un número configurable de agentes, tareas y servidores. Se utiliza un modelo basado en eventos para desencadenar todas las actividades en el sistema. Para todas las simulaciones, limitamos el número de datos de historial para cada servidor a 10, el número de calificaciones de rendimiento por predictor a 10 y asignamos 10 predictores a cada conjunto de predictor para cada agente. Todos los predictores se eligen al azar de un conjunto predefinido arbitrario de 32 predictores del siguiente tipo. Los predictores difieren en diferentes ciclos o tamaños de ventana.-predictor de ciclo N: P (n) = yn usa el valor de historial en nth -last -predictor de n -mean: p (n) = 1 n · n i = 1 yi usa el valor medio de los valores de historial n -last -n n -n-La predictor de regresión lineal: p (n, t) = a · t+b usa el valor de regresión lineal de los últimos n valores de historial donde a, b se calculan utilizando regresión lineal con mínimos cuadrados que se ajustan bajo la consideración de los últimos n datos del historial.- Predictor de N-Distribución: utiliza un valor aleatorio de la distribución de frecuencia de los N valores de N Últimos Historia- N-Mirror Predictor: P (N) = 2 · H- Yn usa la imagen del espejo alrededor de la media de todos los valores de historia del enésimoLast History Value La eficiencia de nuestra asignación de recursos autoorganizado propuesta se evalúa mediante el desarrollo de la carga de recursos de cada servidor a través de la simulación, así como el desarrollo total de la carga de recursos acumulado en todos los recursos compartidos. Las cargas de recursos para cada servidor se calculan utilizando la Ecuación 1 como la suma del consumo de recursos de todos los agentes ejecutados actualmente en este servidor. La carga total de recursos del sistema se calcula como la suma de la carga de recursos de todos los recursos. El algoritmo de asignación de recursos autoorganizado tiene elementos aleatorios. Por lo tanto, los resultados presentados muestran valores medios y derivación estándar calculada en 100 experimentos repetidos.5.1 Configuración experimental Los siguientes parámetros tienen un impacto en el proceso de asignación de recursos. Damos una descripción general de los parámetros y una breve descripción.- Agentes: el número de agentes involucrados en la asignación de recursos. Este número varía en los experimentos entre 650 y 750 que dependen de la cantidad total de recursos del sistema disponibles.- Consumo de recursos: cada tarea consume recursos del servidor para su ejecución. El consumo de recursos se asigna aleatoriamente a cada tarea antes de su asignación desde un intervalo. El consumo de recursos se especifica en unidades de recursos que corresponden a métricas del mundo real como los ciclos de memoria o procesador.- Agente Servidor Home: todos los agentes están ubicados en un servidor de agente local. Los recursos de esos servidores no se consideran en nuestra simulación y no afectan el rendimiento de asignación de recursos.- Recursos del servidor: los experimentos utilizan servidores con una cantidad diferente de recursos compartidos disponibles. El primer experimento se realiza en un entorno de servidor estático que proporciona la misma cantidad de recursos compartidos, mientras que el otro experimento varía el recurso del servidor disponible durante la simulación. La cantidad total de recursos permanece constante en ambos experimentos.- Tiempo de ejecución: el tiempo de ejecución de una tarea para la ejecución, independiente de la plataforma de ejecución. Para este momento, la tarea consume la cantidad asignada de recursos del servidor. Este parámetro se asigna aleatoriamente antes de la ejecución.- Tiempo de creación de tareas: el tiempo antes de la próxima tarea se crea después de una finalización exitosa o no exitosa. Este parámetro influye en la edad de la información histórica sobre los recursos y tiene una gran influencia en la duración de la fase de adaptación inicial. Este parámetro se asigna aleatoriamente después de que se completó la tarea.5.2 Resultados experimentales Esta sección muestra resultados de experimentos seleccionados que demuestran el rendimiento de nuestro mecanismo de asignación de recursos propuesto. El primer experimento muestra el rendimiento en un entorno estable donde varios agentes asignan tareas a servidores que proporcionan una cantidad constante de recursos. El segundo experimento se realizó en un entorno de servidor dinámico con un número constante de agentes. El primer experimento muestra nuestro modelo en un entorno estable de 3 servidores que proporcionan una cantidad total de 7000 unidades de recursos. La capacidad de recursos de cada servidor permanece constante sobre el experimento. Utilizamos 650 agentes con los parámetros del tiempo de ejecución entre 1 y 15 unidades horarias y un tiempo de creación de tareas en las unidades de tiempo de intervalo [0 - 30]. El consumo de recursos de tareas se asigna aleatoriamente desde las unidades de recursos de intervalo [1 - 45]. La Figura 4 muestra los resultados de 100 repeticiones de este experimento. La Figura 4 (a) muestra que la cantidad total de recursos proporcionados es mayor que la demanda de recursos en promedio. Al comienzo del experimento, todos los agentes asignan sus tareas al azar en uno de los servidores disponibles y exploran las capacidades disponibles y las utilizaciones de recursos para aproximadamente 150 unidades horarias. Esta fase de exploración inicial muestra que la carga promedio de recursos de cada servidor tiene un nivel similar. Esto causa una situación de sobrecarga en el servidor 1 debido a su baja capacidad de recursos compartidos y una gran cantidad de recursos gratuitos en el servidor 2. Los agentes que asignaron tareas al servidor 1 detectan la situación de sobrecarga y exploran al azar otros servidores disponibles. Encuentran recursos gratuitos en el servidor 2. Después del período de aprendizaje, los agentes se han autoorganizado en este entorno estable y encuentran una solución estable para la asignación del sexto INTL.

La desviación estándar de las cargas de recursos es pequeña para cada servidor, lo que indica que nuestro enfoque distribuido encuentra soluciones estables en casi todas las ejecuciones. Este experimento utilizó el Algoritmo 2 para la selección del servidor activo. También ejecutamos el mismo experimento con el mecanismo de selección de recursos más gratuito para seleccionar el servidor activo. La asignación de recursos para cada servidor es similar. La cantidad absoluta de recursos gratuitos por servidor es casi la misma. El experimento 2 se realizó en un entorno dinámico de 3 servidores con varios 750 agentes. La cantidad de recursos del servidor 0 y el servidor 1 cambia periódicamente, mientras que la cantidad total de recursos disponibles permanece constante. El servidor 0 tiene una capacidad inicial de 1000 unidades, el servidor 1 comienza con una capacidad de 4000 unidades. El cambio en la capacidad comienza después de 150 unidades de tiempo, que es aproximadamente el final de la fase de aprendizaje. La Figura 5 (B, C, D) muestra el comportamiento de nuestra asignación de recursos autoorganizados en este entorno. Todos los agentes usan el mecanismo de selección de recursos gratuitos deterministas para seleccionar el servidor activo. Se puede ver en la Fig. 5 (b) y 5 (c) que el número de recursos asignados al servidor 0 y el servidor 1 cambia periódicamente con la cantidad de recursos proporcionados. Esto muestra que los agentes pueden detectar recursos disponibles en este entorno dinámico y pueden adaptarse a esos cambios. El desarrollo de carga de recursos del servidor 2 (ver Fig. 5 (d)) muestra un cambio periódico porque a algún agente intentan ser tareas asignadas a este servidor en caso de que su servidor previamente favorecido reduzca la cantidad de recursos compartidos. La carga total de recursos de todos los recursos compartidos es constante sobre los experimentos, lo que indica que todos los agentes asignan sus tareas a uno de los recursos compartidos (comp. Fig. 4 (a)).6. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro en este documento se presentó una técnica de asignación de recursos distribuidos autoorganizados para sistemas de múltiples agentes. Permitimos a los agentes seleccionar la plataforma de ejecución para sus tareas en sí mismas antes de cada ejecución en tiempo de ejecución. En nuestro enfoque, los agentes compiten por una asignación en uno de los 0 500 1,000 1,000 1,500 2,000 Tiempo 0 2,500 5,000 7,500 ResourCelsoad (a) Carga total de recursos versus Capacidad total de recursos compartidos 0 500 1,000 1,000 1,500 2,000 Tiempo 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,000ResourCelOad (b) Servidor de carga de recursos 1 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 Tiempo 0 500 1,000 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 ResourceCelsoad (C) Servidor de carga de recursos 2 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 Tiempo 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 Resource Celload (D)Servidor de carga de recursos 3 Figura 5: Resultados del Experimento 2 en un entorno de servidor dinámico promedió más de 100 repeticiones.Recurso compartido disponible. Los agentes sienten el entorno de su servidor y adoptan su acción para competir más eficiente en el nuevo entorno creado. Este proceso es adaptativo y tiene una fuerte retroalimentación, ya que las decisiones de asignación influyen indirectamente en las decisiones de otros agentes. La asignación de recursos es un efecto puramente emergente. Nuestro mecanismo demuestra que la asignación de recursos puede ser realizada por la competencia efectiva de los agentes individuales y autónomos. Tampoco necesitan coordinación o información de una autoridad superior ni se requiere una comunicación directa adicional entre los agentes. Este mecanismo se inspiró en el razonamiento inductivo y los principios de racionalidad limitados que permiten a los agentes adaptar sus estrategias competir de manera efectiva en un entorno dinámico. En el caso de que un servidor no esté disponible, los agentes pueden adaptarse rápidamente a esta nueva situación explorando nuevos recursos o permanecer en el servidor doméstico si no es posible una asignación. Especialmente en entornos dinámicos y escalables como sistemas de cuadrícula, se requiere un mecanismo robusto y distribuido para la asignación de recursos. Nuestro enfoque de asignación de recursos autoorganizados se evaluó con una serie de experimentos de simulación en un entorno dinámico de agentes y recursos del servidor. Los resultados presentados para este nuevo enfoque para la optimización de migración estratégica son muy prometedores y justifican una investigación adicional en un entorno de sistema real de múltiples agentes. Es una política distribuida, escalable y fácil de entender para la regulación de la oferta y la demanda de recursos. Todo el control se implementa en los agentes. Un mecanismo de decisión simple basado en diferentes creencias del agente crea un comportamiento emergente que conduce a una asignación efectiva de recursos. Este enfoque puede extenderse o apoyarse fácilmente por mecanismos de equilibrio/cola de recursos proporcionados por los recursos. Nuestro enfoque se adapta a los cambios en el medio ambiente, pero no es evolutivo. No hay descubrimiento de nuevas estrategias por parte de los agentes. El conjunto de predictores permanece igual durante toda la vida. De hecho, creemos que esto podría mejorar aún más el comportamiento de los sistemas durante un período a largo plazo y podría ser 80 el sexto INTL. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) investigados en el futuro. La evolución sería muy lenta y selectiva y no influirá en el comportamiento del sistema en un período a corto plazo cubierto por nuestros resultados experimentales. En el futuro cercano investigaremos si una adaptación automática de la tasa de descomposición de información histórica, nuestro algoritmo es posible y puede mejorar el rendimiento de la asignación de recursos. La tasa de descomposición actualmente está predefinida y debe modificarse manualmente dependiendo del medio ambiente. Una gran cantidad de recursos compartidos requieren información histórica más antigua para evitar una exploración de recursos con demasiada frecuencia. Por el contrario, un entorno dinámico con capacidades variables requiere información más actualizada para hacer predicciones más confiables. Somos conscientes de la larga fase de aprendizaje en entornos con una gran cantidad de recursos compartidos conocidos por cada agente. En el caso de que los agentes soliciten más recursos que todos los servidores proporcionan más recursos, todos los agentes explorarán aleatoriamente todos los servidores conocidos. Este proceso de adquisición de información de carga de recursos sobre todos los servidores puede llevar mucho tiempo en el caso de que no se proporcionen suficientes recursos compartidos para todas las tareas. En el peor de los casos, para explorar todos los servidores, la información histórica de algunos servidores ya podría estar desactualizado y la exploración comienza nuevamente. En esta situación, es difícil para un agente recopilar eficientemente información histórica sobre todos los servidores remotos. Este problema necesita más investigación en el futuro.7.

                "In this paper we propose a <br>distributed algorithm</br> that solves the resource allocation problem in distributed multiagent systems.",
                "Our solution is based on the self-organisation of agents, which does not require any facilitator or management layer.",

                "INTRODUCTION With the increasing popularity of distributed computing technologies such as Grid [12] and Web services [20], the Internet is becoming a powerful computing platform where different software peers (e.g., agents) can use existing computing resources to perform tasks.",
                "In this sense, each agent is a resource consumer that acquires a certain amount of resources for the execution of its tasks.",
                "It is difficult for a central resource allocation mechanism to collect and manage the information about all shared resources and resource consumers to effectively perform the allocation of resources.",
                "Hence, distributed solutions of the resource allocation problem are required.",
                "Researchers have recognised these requirements [10] and proposed techniques for distributed resource allocation.",
                "A promising kind of such distributed approaches are based on economic market models [4], inspired by principles of real stock markets.",
                "Even if those approaches are distributed, they usually require a facilitator for pricing, resource discovery and dispatching jobs to resources [5, 9].",
                "Another mainly unsolved problem of those approaches is the fine-tuning of price and time, budget constraints to enable efficient resource allocation in large, dynamic systems [22].",
                "In this paper we propose a distributed solution of the resource allocation problem based on self-organisation of the resource consumers in a system with limited resources.",
                "In our approach, agents dynamically allocate tasks to servers that provide a limited amount of resources.",
                "In our approach, agents select autonomously the execution platform for the task rather than ask a resource broker to do the allocation.",
                "All control needed for our algorithm is distributed among the agents in the system.",
                "They optimise the resource allocation process continuously over their lifetime to changes in the availability of shared resources by learning from past allocation decisions.",
                "The only information available to all agents are resource load and allocation success information from past resource allocations.",
                "Additional resource load information about servers is not disseminated.",
                "The basic concept of our solution is inspired by inductive reasoning and bounded rationality introduced by W. Brian Arthur [2].",
                "The proposed mechanism does not require a central controlling authority, resource management layer or introduce additional communication between agents to decide which task is allocated on which server.",
                "We demonstrate that this mechanism performs well dynamic systems with a large number of tasks and can easily be adapted to various system sizes.",
                "In addition, the overall system performance is not affected in case agents or servers fail or become unavailable.",
                "The proposed approach provides an easy way to implement distributed resource allocation and takes into account multi-agent system tendencies toward autonomy, heterogeneity and unreliability of resources and agents.",
                "This proposed technique can be easily supplemented by techniques for queuing or rejecting resource allocation requests of agents [11].",
                "Such self-managing capabilities of software agents allow a reliable resource allocation even in an environment with unreliable resource providers.",
                "This can be achieved by the mutual interactions between agents by applying techniques from complex system theory.",

                "Generally speaking, resource allocation is a mechanism or policy for the efficient and effective management of the access to a limited resource or set of resources by its consumers.",
                "In the simplest case, resource consumers ask a central broker or dispatcher for available resources where the resource consumer will be allocated.",
                "The broker usually has full knowledge about all system resources.",
                "All incoming requests are directed to the broker who is the solely decision maker.",
                "In those approaches, the resource consumer cannot influence the allocation decision process.",
                "Load balancing [3] is a special case of the resource allocation problem using a broker that tries to be fair to all resources by balancing the system load equally among all resource providers.",
                "This mechanism works best in a homogeneous system.",
                "A simple distributed technique for resource management is capacity planning by refusing or queuing incoming agents to avoid resource overload [11].",
                "From the resource owner perspective, this technique is important to prevent overload at the resource but it is not sufficient for effective resource allocation.",
                "This technique can only provide a good supplement for distributed resource allocation mechanisms.",
                "Most of todays techniques for resource allocation in grid computing toolkits like Globus [12] or Condor-G [13] coordinate the resource allocation with an auctioneer, arbitrator, dispatcher, scheduler or manager.",

                "Subtasks of a job migrate through the network until they find a resource that meets the price constraints.",
                "The jobs migration itinerary is determined by the resources in connecting them in different topologies [17].",
                "The proposed mechanism in this paper eliminates the need of periodic information exchange about resource loads and does not need a connection topology between the resources.",
                "There has been considerable work on decentralised resource allocation techniques using game theory published over recent years.",
                "Most of them are formulated as repetitive games in an idealistic and simplified environment.",
                "For example, Arthur [2] introduced the so called El Farol bar problem that does not allow a perfect, logical and rational solution.",

                "A variation of the El Farol problem is the so called minority game [8].",
                "In this repetitive decision game, an odd number of agents have to choose between two resources based on past success information trying to allocate itself at the resource with the minority.",
