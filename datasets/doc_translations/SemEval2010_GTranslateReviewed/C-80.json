Satyanarayanan Carnegie Mellon University {ntolia,satya}@cs.cmu.edu ABSTRACT With the growing use of dynamic web content generated from relational databases, traditional caching solutions for throughput and latency improvements are ineffective. We describe a middleware layer called Ganesh that reduces the volume of data transmitted without semantic interpretation of queries or results. It achieves this reduction through the use of cryptographic hashing to detect similarities with previous results. These benefits do not require any compromise of the strict consistency semantics provided by the back-end database. Further, Ganesh does not require modifications to applications, web servers, or database servers, and works with closed-source applications and databases. Using two benchmarks representative of dynamic web sites, measurements of our prototype show that it can increase end-to-end throughput by as much as twofold for non-data intensive applications and by as much as tenfold for data intensive ones. Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication Networks]: Distributed Systems; H.2.4 [Database Management]: Systems General Terms Design, Performance 1. INTRODUCTION An increasing fraction of web content is dynamically generated from back-end relational databases. Even when database content remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors. In a multitiered architecture, each web request can stress the WAN link between the web server and the database. This causes user experience to be highly variable because there is no caching to insulate the client from bursty loads. Previous attempts in caching dynamic database content have generally weakened transactional semantics [3, 4] or required application modifications [15, 34]. We report on a new solution that takes the form of a databaseagnostic middleware layer called Ganesh. Ganesh makes no effort to semantically interpret the contents of queries or their results. Instead, it relies exclusively on cryptographic hashing to detect similarities with previous results. Hash-based similarity detection has seen increasing use in distributed file systems [26, 36, 37] for improving performance on low-bandwidth networks. However, these techniques have not been used for relational databases. Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement. One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases. First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure. This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness. In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection. Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques. Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available. This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code. Our experiments show that Ganesh, while conceptually simple, can improve performance significantly at bandwidths representative of todays commercial Internet. On benchmarks modeling multitiered web applications, the throughput improvement was as high as tenfold for data-intensive workloads. For workloads that were not data-intensive, throughput improvements of up to twofold were observed. Even when bandwidth was not a constraint, Ganesh had low overhead and did not hurt performance. Our experiments also confirm that exploiting the structure present in database results is crucial to this performance improvement. 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 Dynamic Content Generation As the World Wide Web has grown, many web sites have decentralized their data and functionality by pushing them to the edges of the Internet. Today, eBusiness systems often use a three-tiered architecture consisting of a front-end web server, an application server, and a back-end database server. Figure 1 illustrates this architecture. The first two tiers can be replicated close to a concentration of clients at the edge of the Internet. This improves user experience by lowering end-to-end latency and reducing exposure WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 311 Back-End Database Server Front-End Web and Application Servers Figure 1: Multi-Tier Architecture to backbone traffic congestion. It can also increase the availability and scalability of web services. Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers. While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7]. As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38]. Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2]. In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries. As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links. The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2. These techniques rely on some basic assumptions. Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant. In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output. The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible. Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions. The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur. Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier. A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission. The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17]. However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh. All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data. Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function. While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple. There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g. SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent. No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site. Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways. For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results. As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results. When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments. Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results. In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication. Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects. We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results. Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system. We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected. There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments. The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results. Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm. When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37]. Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash. Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value. The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size. These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects. As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data. The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions. However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data. Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes. In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries. Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection. The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows. It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows. The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary. It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data. Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints. Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult. If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows. However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results. WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use. Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks. Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure. The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting. Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers. Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact. Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption. Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement. We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal. This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software. It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure. These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems. The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files. Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism. Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application. As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications. The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition. As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface. The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results. At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy. This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database. The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation. Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor. Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database. It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results. The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver. It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy. To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results. This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results. No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates. The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh. Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time. The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b). The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy. The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver. Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found. While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN. To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache. One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available. This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result. However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments. To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache. Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence. Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments. In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments. If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them. Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes. This allows the proxy to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.

It examines this output to see if a Java object of type ResultSet is present. The JDBC interface uses this data type to store results of database queries. If a ResultSet object is found, it is shrunk as discussed below. All other Java objects are passed through unmodified. As discussed in Section 3.1, the proxy uses the row boundaries defined in the ResultSet to partition it into fragments consisting of single result rows. All ResultSet objects are converted into objects of a new type called RecipeResultSet. We use the term recipe for this compact description of a database result because of its similarity to a file recipe in the CASPER file system [37]. The conversion replaces each result fragment that is likely to be present in the Ganesh drivers cache by a SHA-1 hash of that fragment. Previously unseen result fragments are retained verbatim. The proxy also retains hashes for the new result fragments as they will be present in the drivers cache in the future. Note that the proxy only caches hashes for result fragments and does not cache recipes. The proxy constructs a RecipeResultSet by checking for similarity at the entire result and then the row level. If the entire result is predicted to be present in the Ganesh drivers cache, the RecipeResultSet is simply a single hash of the entire result. Otherwise, it contains hashes for those rows predicted to be present in that cache; all other rows are retained verbatim. If the proxy estimates an overall space savings, it will transmit the RecipeResultSet. Otherwise the original ResultSet is transmitted. The RecipeResultSet objects are transformed back into ResultSet objects by the Ganesh driver. Figure 4 illustrates ResultSet handling at both ends. Each SHA-1 hash found in a RecipeResultSet is looked up in the local cache of result fragments. On a hit, the hash is replaced by the corresponding fragment. On a miss, the driver contacts the Ganesh proxy to fetch the fragment. All previously unseen result fragments that were retained verbatim by the proxy are hashed and added to the result cache. There should be very few misses if the proxy has accurately tracked the Ganesh drivers cache state. A future optimization would be to batch the fetch of missing fragments. This would be valuable when there are many small missing fragments in a high-latency WAN. Once the transformation is complete, the fully reconstructed ResultSet object is passed up to the application. 4. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION Three questions follow from the goals and design of Ganesh: • First, can performance can be improved significantly by exploiting similarity across database results? Benchmark Dataset Details 500,000 Users, 12,000 Stories BBOARD 2.0 GB 3,298,000 Comments AUCTION 1.3 GB 1,000,000 Users, 34,000 Items Table 1: Benchmark Dataset Details • Second, how important is Ganeshs structural similarity detection relative to Rabin fingerprintings similarity detection? • Third, is the overhead of the proxy-based design acceptable? Our evaluation answers these question through controlled experiments with the Ganesh prototype. This section describes the benchmarks used, our evaluation procedure, and the experimental setup. Results of the experiments are presented in Sections 5, 6, and 7. 4.1 Benchmarks Our evaluation is based on two benchmarks [18] that have been widely used by other researchers to evaluate various aspects of multi-tier [27] and eBusiness architectures [9]. The first benchmark, BBOARD, is modeled after Slashdot, a technology-oriented news site. The second benchmark, AUCTION, is modeled after eBay, an online auction site. In both benchmarks, most content is dynamically generated from information stored in a database. Details of the datasets used can be found in Table 1. 4.1.1 The BBOARD Benchmark The BBOARD benchmark, also known as RUBBoS [18], models Slashdot, a popular technology-oriented web site. Slashdot aggregates links to news stories and other topics of interest found elsewhere on the web. The site also serves as a bulletin board by allowing users to comment on the posted stories in a threaded conversation form. It is not uncommon for a story to gather hundreds of comments in a matter of hours. The BBOARD benchmark is similar to the site and models the activities of a user, including readonly operations such as browsing the stories of the day, browsing story categories, and viewing comments as well as write operations such as new user registration, adding and moderating comments, and story submission. The benchmark consists of three different phases: a short warmup phase, a runtime phase representing the main body of the workload, and a short cool-down phase. In this paper we only report results from the runtime phase. The warm-up phase is important in establishing dynamic system state, but measurements from that phase are not significant for our evaluation. The cool-down phase is solely for allowing the benchmark to shut down. The warm-up, runtime, and cool-down phases are 2, 15, and 2 minutes respectively. The number of simulated clients were 400, 800, 1200, and 1600. The benchmark is available in a Java Servlets and PHP version and has different datasets; we evaluated Ganesh using the Java Servlets version and the Expanded dataset. The BBOARD benchmark defines two different workloads. The first, the Authoring mix, consists of 70% read-only operations and 30% read-write operations. The second, the Browsing mix, contains only read-only operations and does not update the database. 4.1.2 The AUCTION Benchmark The AUCTION benchmark, also known as RUBiS [18], models eBay, the online auction site. The eBay web site is used to buy and sell items via an auction format. The main activities of a user include browsing, selling, or bidding for items. Modeling the activities on this site, this benchmark includes read-only activities such as browsing items by category and by region, as well as read-write WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 314 NetEm Router Ganesh Proxy Clients Web and Application Server Database Server Figure 5: Experimental Setup activities such as bidding for items, buying and selling items, and leaving feedback. As with BBOARD, the benchmark consists of three different phases. The warm-up, runtime, and cool-down phases for this experiment are 1.5, 15, and 1 minutes respectively. We tested Ganesh with four client configurations where the number of test clients was set to 400, 800, 1200, and 1600. The benchmark is available in a Enterprise Java Bean (EJB), Java Servlets, and PHP version and has different datasets; we evaluated Ganesh with the Java Servlets version and the Expanded dataset. The AUCTION benchmark defines two different workloads. The first, the Bidding mix, consists of 70% read-only operations and 30% read-write operations. The second, the Browsing mix, contains only read-only operations and does not update the database. 4.2 Experimental Procedure Both benchmarks involve a synthetic workload of clients accessing a web server. The number of clients emulated is an experimental parameter. Each emulated client runs an instance of the benchmark in its own thread, using a matrix to transition between different benchmark states. The matrix defines a stochastic model with probabilities of transitioning between the different states that represent typical user actions. An example transition is a user logging into the AUCTION system and then deciding on whether to post an item for sale or bid on active auctions. Each client also models user think time between requests. The think time is modeled as an exponential distribution with a mean of 7 seconds. We evaluate Ganesh along two axes: number of clients and WAN bandwidth. Higher loads are especially useful in understanding Ganeshs performance when the CPU or disk of the database server or proxy is the limiting factor. A previous study has shown that approximately 50% of the wide-area Internet bottlenecks observed had an available bandwidth under 10 Mb/s [1]. Based on this work, we focus our evaluation on the WAN bandwidth of 5 Mb/s with 66 ms of round-trip latency, representative of severely constrained network paths, and 20 Mb/s with 33 ms of round-trip latency, representative of a moderately constrained network path. We also report Ganeshs performance at 100 Mb/s with no added round-trip latency. This bandwidth, representative of an unconstrained network, is especially useful in revealing any potential overhead of Ganesh in situations where WAN bandwidth is not the limiting factor. For each combination of number of clients and WAN bandwidth, we measured results from the two configurations listed below: • Native: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(a). Native avoids Ganeshs overhead in using a proxy and performing Java object serialization. • Ganesh: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(b). For a given number of clients and WAN bandwidth, comparing these results to the corresponding Native results gives the performance benefit due to the Ganesh middleware system. The metric used to quantify the improvement in throughput is the number of client requests that can be serviced per second. The metric used to quantify Ganeshs overhead is the average response time for a client request. For all of the experiments, the Ganesh driver used by the application server used a cache size of 100,000 items1 . The proxy was effective in tracking the Ganesh drivers cache state; for all of our experiments the miss rate on the driver never exceeded 0.7%. 4.3 Experimental Setup The experimental setup used for the benchmarks can be seen in Figure 5. All machines were 3.2 GHz Pentium 4s (with HyperThreading enabled.) With the exception of the database server, all machines had 2 GB of SDRAM and ran the Fedora Core Linux distribution. The database server had 4 GB of SDRAM. We used Apaches Tomcat as both the application server that hosted the Java Servlets and the web server. Both benchmarks used Java Servlets to generate the dynamic content. The database server used the open source MySQL database. For the native JDBC drivers, we used the Connector/J drivers provided by MySQL. The application server used Suns Java Virtual Machine as the runtime environment for the Java Servlets. The sysstat tool was used to monitor the CPU, network, disk, and memory utilization on all machines. The machines were connected by a switched gigabit Ethernet network. As shown in Figure 5, the front-end web and application server was separated from the proxy and database server by a NetEm router [16]. This router allowed us to control the bandwidth and latency settings on the network. The NetEm router is a standard PC with two network cards running the Linux Traffic Control and Network Emulation software. The bandwidth and latency constraints were only applied to the link between the application server and the database for the native case and between the application server and the proxy for the Ganesh case. There is no communication between the application server and the database with Ganesh as all data flows through the proxy. As our focus was on the WAN link between the application server and the database, there were no constraints on the link between the simulated test clients and the web server. 5. THROUGHPUT AND RESPONSE TIME In this section, we address the first question raised in Section 4: Can performance can be improved significantly by exploiting similarity across database results? To answer this question, we use results from the BBOARD and AUCTION benchmarks. We use two metrics to quantify the performance improvement obtainable through the use of Ganesh: throughput, from the perspective of the web server, and average response time, from the perspective of the client. Throughput is measured in terms of the number of client requests that can be serviced per second. 5.1 BBOARD Results and Analysis 5.1.1 Authoring Mix Figures 6 (a) and (b) present the average number of requests serviced per second and the average response time for these requests as perceived by the clients for BBOARDs Authoring Mix. As Figure 6 (a) shows, Native easily saturates the 5 Mb/s link. At 400 clients, the Native solution delivers 29 requests/sec with an average response time of 8.3 seconds. Natives throughput drops with an increase in test clients as clients timeout due to congestion at the application server. Usability studies have shown that response times above 10 seconds cause the user to move on to 1 As Java lacks a sizeof() operator, Java caches therefore limit their size based on the number of objects. The size of cache dumps taken at the end of the experiments never exceeded 212 MB.

The maximum standard deviation for throughput and response time was 9.8% and 11.9% of the corresponding mean. Figure 6: BBOARD Benchmark - Throughput and Average Response Time other tasks [24]. Based on these numbers, increasing the number of test clients makes the Native system unusable. Ganesh at 5 Mb/s, however, delivers a twofold improvement with 400 test clients and a fivefold improvement at 1200 clients. Ganeshs performance drops slightly at 1200 and 1600 clients as the network is saturated. Compared to Native, Figure 6 (b) shows that Ganeshs response times are substantially lower with sub-second response times at 400 clients. Figure 6 (a) also shows that for 400 and 800 test clients Ganesh at 5 Mb/s has the same throughput and average response time as Native at 20 Mb/s. Only at 1200 and 1600 clients does Native at 20 Mb/s deliver higher throughput than Ganesh at 5 Mb/s. Comparing both Ganesh and Native at 20 Mb/s, we see that Ganesh is no longer bandwidth constrained and delivers up to a twofold improvement over Native at 1600 test clients. As Ganesh does not saturate the network with higher test client configurations, at 1600 test clients, its average response time is 0.1 seconds rather than Natives 7.7 seconds. As expected, there are no visible gains from Ganesh at the higher bandwidth of 100 Mb/s where the network is no longer the bottleneck. Ganesh, however, still tracks Native in terms of throughput. 5.1.2 Browsing Mix Figures 6 (c) and (d) present the average number of requests serviced per second and the average response time for these requests as perceived by the clients for BBOARDs Browsing Mix. Regardless of the test client configuration, Figure 6 (c) shows that Natives throughput at 5 Mb/s is limited to 10 reqs/sec. Ganesh at 5 Mb/s with 400 test clients, delivers more than a sixfold increase in throughput. The improvement increases to over a elevenfold increase at 800 test clients before Ganesh saturates the network. Further, Figure 6 (d) shows that Natives average response time of 35 seconds at 400 test clients make the system unusable. These high response times further increase with the addition of test clients. Even with the 1600 test client configuration Ganesh delivers an acceptable average response time of 8.2 seconds. Due to the data-intensive nature of the Browsing mix, Ganesh at 5 Mb/s surprisingly performs much better than Native at 20 Mb/s. Further, as shown in Figure 6 (d), while the average response time for Native at 20 Mb/s is acceptable at 400 test clients, it is unusable with 800 test clients with an average response time of 15.8 seconds. Like the 5 Mb/s case, this response time increases with the addition of extra test clients. Ganesh at 20 Mb/s and both Native and Ganesh at 100 Mb/s are not bandwidth limited. However, performance plateaus out after 1200 test clients due to the database CPU being saturated. 5.1.3 Filter Variant We were surprised by the Native performance from the BBOARD benchmark. At the bandwidth of 5 Mb/s, Native performance was lower than what we had expected. It turned out the benchmark code that displays stories read all the comments associated with the particular story from the database and only then did some postprocessing to select the comments to be displayed. While this is exactly the behavior of SlashCode, the code base behind the Slashdot web site, we decided to modify the benchmark to perform some pre-filtering at the database. This modified benchmark, named the Filter Variant, models a developer who applies optimizations at the SQL level to transfer less data. In the interests of brevity, we only briefly summarize the results from the Authoring mix. For the Authoring mix, at 800 test clients at 5 Mb/s, Figure 7 (a) shows that Natives throughput increase by 85% when compared to the original benchmark while Ganeshs improvement is smaller at 15%. Natives performance drops above 800 clients as the test clients time out due to high response times. The most significant gain for Native is seen at 20 Mb/s. At 1600 test clients, when compared to the original benchmark, Native sees a 73% improvement in throughput and a 77% reduction in average response time.

Figure 7: BBOARD Benchmark - Filter Variant - Throughput and Average Response Time Ganesh sees no improvement when compared to the original, it still processes 19% more requests/sec than Native. Thus, while the optimizations were more helpful to Native, Ganesh still delivers an improvement in performance. 5.2 AUCTION Results and Analysis 5.2.1 Bidding Mix Figures 8 (a) and (b) present the average number of requests serviced per second and the average response time for these requests as perceived by the clients for AUCTIONs Bidding Mix. As mentioned earlier, the Bidding mix consists of a mixture of read and write operations. The AUCTION benchmark is not as data intensive as BBOARD. Therefore, most of the gains are observed at the lower bandwidth of 5 Mb/s. Figure 8 (a) shows that the increase in throughput due to Ganesh ranges from 8% at 400 test clients to 18% with 1600 test clients. As seen in Figure 8 (b), the average response times for Ganesh are significantly lower than Native ranging from a decrease of 84% at 800 test clients to 88% at 1600 test clients. Figure 8 (a) also shows that with a fourfold increase of bandwidth from 5 Mb/s to 20 Mb/s, Native is no longer bandwidth constrained and there is no performance difference between Ganesh and Native. With the higher test client configurations, we did observe that the bandwidth used by Ganesh was lower than Native. Ganesh might still be useful in these non-constrained scenarios if bandwidth is purchased on a metered basis. Similar results are seen for the 100 Mb/s scenario. 5.2.2 Browsing Mix For AUCTIONs Browsing Mix, Figures 8 (c) and (d) present the average number of requests serviced per second and the average response time for these requests as perceived by the clients. Again, most of the gains are observed at lower bandwidths. At 5 Mb/s, Native and Ganesh deliver similar throughput and response times with 400 test clients. While the throughput for both remains the same at 800 test clients, Figure 8 (d) shows that Ganeshs average response time is 62% lower than Native. Native saturates the link at 800 clients and adding extra test clients only increases the average response time. Ganesh, regardless of the test client configuration, is not bandwidth constrained and maintains the same response time. At 1600 test clients, Figure 8 (c) shows that Ganeshs throughput is almost twice that of Native. At the higher bandwidths of 20 and 100 Mb/s, neither Ganesh nor Native is bandwidth limited and deliver equivalent throughput and response times. Benchmark Orig. Size Ganesh Size Rabin Size SelectSort1 223.6 MB 5.4 MB 219.3 MB SelectSort2 223.6 MB 5.4 MB 223.6 MB Table 2: Similarity Microbenchmarks 6. STRUCTURAL VS. RABIN SIMILARITY In this section, we address the second question raised in Section 4: How important is Ganeshs structural similarity detection relative to Rabin fingerprinting-based similarity detecting? To answer this question, we used microbenchmarks and the BBOARD and AUCTION benchmarks. As Ganesh always performed better than Rabin fingerprinting, we only present a subset of the results here in the interests of brevity. 6.1 Microbenchmarks Two microbenchmarks show an example of the effects of data reordering on Rabin fingerprinting algorithm. In the first microbenchmark, SelectSort1, a query with a specified sort order selects 223.6 MB of data spread over approximately 280 K rows. The query is then repeated with a different sort attribute. While the same number of rows and the same data is returned, the order of rows is different. In such a scenario, one would expect a large amount of similarity to be detected between both results. As Table 2 shows, Ganeshs row-based algorithm achieves a 97.6% reduction while the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm, with the average chunk size parameter set to 4 KB, only achieves a 1% reduction. The reason, as shown earlier in Figure 2, is that with Rabin fingerprinting, the spans of data between two consecutive boundaries usually cross row boundaries. With the order of the rows changing in the second result and the Rabin fingerprints now spanning different rows, the algorithm is unable to detect significant similarity. The small gain seen is mostly for those single rows that are large enough to be broken into multiple chunks. SelectSort2, another micro-benchmark executed the same queries but increased the minimum chunk size of the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm. As can be seen in Table 2, even the small gain from the previous microbenchmark disappears as the minimum chunk size was greater than the average row size. While one can partially address these problems by dynamically varying the parameters of the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm, this can be computationally expensive, especially in the presence of changing workloads. 6.2 Application Benchmarks We ran the BBOARD benchmark described in Section 4.1.1 on two versions of Ganesh: the first with Rabin fingerprinting used as WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 317 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 Mb/s 20 Mb/s 100 Mb/s Test Clients Requests/sec Native Ganesh 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 Mb/s 20 Mb/s 100 Mb/s Test Clients Avg.Resp.Time(sec) Native Ganesh Note Logscale (a) Throughput: Bidding Mix (b) Response Time: Bidding Mix 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 Mb/s 20 Mb/s 100 Mb/s Test Clients Requests/sec Native Ganesh 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 Mb/s 20 Mb/s 100 Mb/s Test Clients Avg.Resp.Time(sec) Native Ganesh Note Logscale (c) Throughput: Browsing Mix (d) Response Time: Browsing Mix Mean of three trials. The maximum standard deviation for throughput and response time was 2.2% and 11.8% of the corresponding mean. Figure 8: AUCTION Benchmark - Throughput and Average Response Time the chunking algorithm and the second with Ganeshs row-based algorithm. Rabins results for the Browsing Mix are normalized to Ganeshs results and presented in Figure 9. As Figure 9 (a) shows, at 5 Mb/s, independent of the test client configuration, Rabin significantly underperforms Ganesh. This happens because of a combination of two reasons. First, as outlined in Section 3.1, Rabin finds less similarity as it does not exploit the results structural information. Second, this benchmark contained some queries that generated large results. In this case, Rabin, with a small average chunk size, generated a large number of objects that evicted other useful data from the cache. In contrast, Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly increase the size of the chunks. This was confirmed as cache statistics showed that Ganeshs hit ratio was roughly three time that of Rabin. Throughput measurements at 20 Mb/s were similar with the exception of Rabins performance with 400 test clients. In this case, Ganesh was not network limited and, in fact, the throughput was the same as 400 clients at 5 Mb/s. Rabin, however, took advantage of the bandwidth increase from 5 to 20 Mb/s to deliver a slightly better performance. At 100 Mb/s, Rabins throughput was almost similar to Ganesh as bandwidth was no longer a bottleneck. The normalized response time, presented in Figure 9 (b), shows similar trends. At 5 and 20 Mb/s, the addition of test clients decreases the normalized response time as Ganeshs average response time increases faster than Rabins. However, at no point does Rabin outperform Ganesh. Note that at 400 and 800 clients at 100 Mb/s, Rabin does have a higher overhead even when it is not bandwidth constrained. As mentioned in Section 3.1, this is due to the fact that Rabin has to hash each ResultSet twice. The overhead disappears with 1200 and 1600 clients as the database CPU is saturated and limits the performance of both Ganesh and Rabin. 7. PROXY OVERHEAD In this section, we address the third question raised in Section 4: Is the overhead of Ganeshs proxy-based design acceptable? To answer this question, we concentrate on its performance at the higher bandwidths. Our evaluation in Section 5 showed that Ganesh, when compared to Native, can deliver a substantial throughput improvement at lower bandwidths. It is only at higher bandwidths that latency, measured by the average response time for a client request, and throughput, measured by the number of client requests that can be serviced per second, overheads would be visible. Looking at the Authoring mix of the original BBOARD benchmark, there are no visible gains from Ganesh at 100 Mb/s. Ganesh, however, still tracks Native in terms of throughput. While the average response time is higher for Ganesh, the absolute difference is in between 0.01 and 0.04 seconds and would be imperceptible to the end-user. The Browsing mix shows an even smaller difference in average response times. The results from the filter variant of the BBOARD benchmarks are similar. Even for the AUCTION benchmark, the difference between Native and Ganeshs response time at 100 Mb/s was never greater than 0.02 seconds. The only exception to the above results was seen in the filter variant of the BBOARD benchmark where Ganesh at 1600 test clients added 0.85 seconds to the average response time. Thus, even for much faster networks where the WAN link is not the bottleneck, Ganesh always delivers throughput equivalent to Native. While some extra latency is added by the proxy-based design, it is usually imperceptible. 8. RELATED WORK To the best of our knowledge, Ganesh is the first system that combines the use of hash-based techniques with caching of database results to improve throughput and response times for applications with dynamic content.

Mean of three trials. The maximum standard deviation for throughput and response time was 9.1% and 13.9% of the corresponding mean. Figure 9: Normalized Comparison of Ganesh vs. Rabin - BBOARD Browsing Mix detecting similarity. In this section, we first discuss alternative approaches to caching dynamic content and then examine other uses of hash-based primitives in distributed systems. 8.1 Caching Dynamic Content At the database layer, a number of systems have advocated middletier caching where parts of the database are replicated at the edge or server [3, 4, 20]. These systems either cache entire tables in what is essentially a replicated database or use materialized views from previous query replies [19]. They require tight integration with the back-end database to ensure a time bound on the propagation of updates. These systems are also usually targeted towards workloads that do not require strict consistency and can tolerate stale data. Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing. Gao et al. [15] propose using a distributed object replication architecture where the data stores consistency requirements are adapted on a per-application basis. These solutions require substantial developer resources and detailed understanding of the application being modified. While systems that attempt to automate the partitioning and replication of an applications database exist [34], they do not provide full transaction semantics. In comparison, Ganesh does not weaken any of the semantics provided by the underlying database. Recent work in the evaluation of edge caching options for dynamic web sites [38] has suggested that, without careful planning, employing complex offloading strategies can hurt performance. Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers except the database should be offloaded to the edge. Our evaluation of Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios. To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level. The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are complementary and they would benefit each other. Moving up to the presentation layer, there has been widespread adoption of fragment-based caching [14], which improves cache utilization by separately caching different parts of generated web pages. While fragment-based caching works at the edge, a recent proposal has proposed moving web page assembly to the clients to optimize content delivery [31]. While Ganesh is not used at the presentation layer, the same principles have been applied in Duplicate Transfer Detection [25] to increase web cache efficiency as well as for web access across bandwidth limited links [33]. 8.2 Hash-based Systems The past few years have seen the emergence of many systems that exploit hash-based techniques. At the heart of all these systems is the idea of detecting similarity in data without requiring interpretation of that data. This simple yet elegant idea relies on cryptographic hashing, as discussed earlier in Section 2. Successful applications of this idea span a wide range of storage systems. Examples include peer-to-peer backup of personal computing files [11], storage-efficient archiving of data [29], and finding similar files [21]. Spring and Wetherall [35] apply similar principles at the network level. Using synchronized caches at both ends of a network link, duplicated data is replaced by smaller tokens for transmission and then restored at the remote end. This and other hash-based systems such as the CASPER [37] and LBFS [26] filesystems, and Layer-2 bandwidth optimizers such as Riverbed and Peribit use Rabin fingerprinting [30] to discover spans of commonality in data. This approach is especially useful when data items are modified in-place through insertions, deletions, and updates. However, as Section 6 shows, the performance of this technique can show a dramatic drop in the presence of data reordering. Ganesh instead uses row boundaries as dividers for detecting similarity. The most aggressive use of hash-based techniques is by systems that use hashes as the primary identifiers for objects in persistent storage. Storage systems such as CFS [12] and PAST [13] that have been built using distributed hash tables fall into this category. Single Instance Storage [6] and Venti [29] are other examples of such systems. As discussed in Section 2.2, the use of cryptographic hashes for addressing persistent data represents a deeper level of faith in their collision-resistance than that assumed by Ganesh. If time reveals shortcomings in the hash algorithm, the effort involved in correcting the flaw is much greater. In Ganesh, it is merely a matter of replacing the hash algorithm. 9. CONCLUSION The growing use of dynamic web content generated from relational databases places increased demands on WAN bandwidth. Traditional caching solutions for bandwidth and latency reduction are often ineffective for such content. This paper shows that the impact of WAN accesses to databases can be substantially reduced through the Ganesh architecture without any compromise of the databases strict consistency semantics. The essence of the Ganesh architecture is the use of computation at the edges to reduce communication through the Internet. Ganesh is able to use cryptographic hashes to detect similarity with previous results and send WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 319 compact recipes of results rather than full results. Our design uses interposition to achieve complete transparency: clients, application servers, and database servers are all unaware of Ganeshs presence and require no modification. Our experimental evaluation confirms that Ganesh, while conceptually simple, can be highly effective in improving throughput and response time. Our results also confirm that exploiting the structure present in database results to detect similarity is crucial to this performance improvement. 10.

Categorías y descriptores de sujetos C.2.4 [Redes de comunicación por computadora]: sistemas distribuidos;H.2.4 [Gestión de bases de datos]: Diseño de términos generales de sistemas, rendimiento 1. Introducción Una fracción creciente del contenido web se genera dinámicamente a partir de bases de datos relacionales de fondo. Incluso cuando el contenido de la base de datos permanece sin cambios, la localidad temporal de acceso no puede ser explotada porque el contenido dinámico no se puede almacenar en caché por los navegadores web o por servidores de almacenamiento de almacenamiento intermedio como los espejos de Akamai. En una arquitectura múltiple, cada solicitud web puede enfatizar el enlace WAN entre el servidor web y la base de datos. Esto hace que la experiencia del usuario sea muy variable porque no hay almacenamiento en caché para aislar al cliente de las cargas explosivas. Los intentos anteriores de almacenamiento en caché del contenido de la base de datos dinámica generalmente han debilitado la semántica transaccional [3, 4] o las modificaciones de la aplicación requeridas [15, 34]. Informamos sobre una nueva solución que toma la forma de una capa de middleware de diagnóstico de datos llamada Ganesh. Ganesh no hace ningún esfuerzo para interpretar semánticamente el contenido de las consultas o sus resultados. En cambio, se basa exclusivamente en el hash criptográfico para detectar similitudes con resultados anteriores. La detección de similitud basada en hash ha visto un uso creciente en los sistemas de archivos distribuidos [26, 36, 37] para mejorar el rendimiento en las redes de bajo ancho de banda. Sin embargo, estas técnicas no se han utilizado para bases de datos relacionales. A diferencia de los enfoques anteriores que utilizan métodos genéricos para detectar similitud, Ganesh explota la estructura de los resultados de la base de datos relacional para producir una mejora superior del rendimiento. Uno enfrenta al menos tres desafíos en la aplicación de la detección de similitud basada en el hash a las bases de datos de back-end. Primero, el trabajo previo en este espacio ha visto tradicionalmente el contenido de almacenamiento como bolsas de bits sin interpretación sin estructura interna. Esto permite que las técnicas basadas en el hash funcionen en largas y contiguas ejecuciones de datos para la máxima efectividad. En contraste, las bases de datos relacionales tienen una rica estructura interna que puede no ser tan susceptible de detección de similitud basada en el hash. En segundo lugar, las bases de datos relacionales tienen limitaciones de integridad y consistencia muy estrictas que no deben verse comprometidas por el uso de técnicas basadas en hash. En tercer lugar, el código fuente de bases de datos comerciales generalmente no está disponible. Esto contrasta con el trabajo anterior que presumió disponibilidad del código fuente. Nuestros experimentos muestran que Ganesh, aunque conceptualmente simple, puede mejorar el rendimiento significativamente en los anchos de banda representativos de Internet comercial de hoy. En los puntos de referencia modelando aplicaciones web multisetas, la mejora del rendimiento fue tan alta como diez veces para cargas de trabajo intensivas en datos. Para las cargas de trabajo que no eran intensivas en datos, se observaron mejoras de rendimiento de hasta dos veces. Incluso cuando el ancho de banda no era una restricción, Ganesh tuvo un bajo overos y no dañó el rendimiento. Nuestros experimentos también confirman que explotar la estructura presente en los resultados de la base de datos es crucial para esta mejora del rendimiento.2. Antecedentes 2.1 Generación de contenido dinámico A medida que la red mundial ha crecido, muchos sitios web han descentralizado sus datos y funcionalidad al empujarlos a los bordes de Internet. Hoy en día, los sistemas de ebusiness a menudo usan una arquitectura de tres niveles que consiste en un servidor web frontal, un servidor de aplicaciones y un servidor de base de datos de fondo. La Figura 1 ilustra esta arquitectura. Los dos primeros niveles se pueden replicar cerca de una concentración de clientes en el borde de Internet. Esto mejora la experiencia del usuario al reducir la latencia de extremo a extremo y reducir la exposición www 2007 / seguimiento: rendimiento y escalabilidad Sesión: sistemas escalables para contenido dinámico 311 Back-end de base de datos Servidor front-end servidores Figura 1: arquitectura de múltiples nivelesa la congestión del tráfico de la columna vertebral. También puede aumentar la disponibilidad y la escalabilidad de los servicios web. El contenido que se genera dinámicamente a partir de la base de datos de back-end no se puede almacenar en caché en los dos primeros niveles. Si bien las bases de datos se pueden replicar fácilmente en una LAN, esto es inviable en una WAN debido a la difícil tarea de proporcionar simultáneamente una fuerte consistencia, disponibilidad y tolerancia a las particiones de red [7]. Como resultado, las bases de datos tienden a ser centralizadas para cumplir con los fuertes requisitos de consistencia de muchas aplicaciones de ebusiness, como la banca, las finanzas y la venta minorista en línea [38]. Por lo tanto, la base de datos de fondo generalmente se encuentra lejos de muchos conjuntos de nodos de primer y segundo nivel [2]. En ausencia de almacenamiento en caché y replicación, el ancho de banda WAN puede convertirse fácilmente en un factor limitante en el rendimiento y la escalabilidad de las aplicaciones intensivas en datos.2.2 Los sistemas basados en hash Ganeshs El enfoque está en la transmisión eficiente de los resultados al descubrir similitudes con los resultados de consultas anteriores. Como las consultas SQL pueden generar grandes resultados, las técnicas basadas en hash se prestan bien al problema de transferir eficientemente estos grandes resultados a través de enlaces limitados de ancho de banda. El uso de técnicas basadas en hash para reducir el volumen de datos transmitidos ha surgido como un tema común de muchos sistemas de almacenamiento recientes, como se discutió en la Sección 8.2. Estas técnicas se basan en algunos supuestos básicos. Se supone que las funciones criptográficas hash son resistentes a la colisión. En otras palabras, es computacionalmente intratable encontrar dos entradas que hash a la misma salida. También se supone que las funciones son unidireccionales;Es decir, encontrar una entrada que resulte en una salida específica es computacionalmente inviable. Menezes et al.[23] Proporcione más detalles sobre estos supuestos. Los supuestos anteriores permiten que los sistemas basados en el hash asumen que las colisiones no ocurren. Por lo tanto, pueden tratar el hash de un elemento de datos como su identificador único. Una colección de elementos de datos se vuelve efectivamente en dirección de contenido, lo que permite que un hash pequeño sirva como un código de código para un elemento de datos mucho más grande en el almacenamiento permanente o la transmisión de red. La suposición de que las colisiones son tan raras como para ser efectivamente inexistentes recientemente ha sido criticado [17]. Sin embargo, como explicó Black [5], creemos que estos problemas no forman una preocupación para Ganesh. Toda la comunicación es entre partes de confianza del sistema y un adversario no tiene forma de obligar a Ganesh a aceptar datos no válidos. Además, Ganesh no depende críticamente de ninguna función de hash específica. Si bien actualmente usamos SHA-1, reemplazarlo con una función hash diferente sería simple. No habría impacto en el rendimiento como funciones hash más fuertes (p. SHA256) solo agregue unos pocos bytes adicionales y los hashes generados siguen siendo órdenes de magnitud más pequeñas que los elementos de datos que representan. No se requiere rehacer el almacenamiento permanente ya que Ganesh solo usa hashing en datos volátiles.3. Diseño e implementación Ganesh explota la redundancia en el flujo de resultados para evitar transmitir fragmentos de resultados que ya están presentes en el sitio de la consulta. La redundancia puede surgir naturalmente de muchas maneras diferentes. Por ejemplo, una consulta repetida después de un cierto intervalo puede devolver un resultado diferente debido a las actualizaciones de la base de datos;Sin embargo, puede haber una comunidad significativa entre los dos resultados. Como otro ejemplo, un usuario que está refinando una búsqueda puede generar una secuencia de consultas con resultados superpuestos. Cuando Ganesh detecta la redundancia, suprime la transmisión de los fragmentos de resultados correspondientes. En cambio, transmite un resumen mucho más pequeño de esos fragmentos y permite que el sitio de la consulta reconstruya el resultado a través de la búsqueda hash en un caché de resultados anteriores. En efecto, Ganesh utiliza el cálculo en los bordes para reducir la comunicación por Internet. Nuestra descripción de Ganesh se centra en cuatro aspectos. Primero explicamos nuestro enfoque para detectar la similitud en los resultados de la consulta. A continuación, discutimos cómo la arquitectura Ganesh es completamente invisible para todos los componentes de un sistema de múltiples niveles. Luego describimos el enfoque basado en el poder de Ganeshs y el flujo de datos para detectar similitud.3.1 Detección de similitud Una de las decisiones clave de diseño en Ganesh es cómo se detecta la similitud. Hay muchas formas potenciales de descomponer un resultado en fragmentos. La forma óptima es, por supuesto, la que resulta en el objeto más pequeño posible para la transmisión para los resultados de consultas dados. Encontrar esta descomposición óptima es un problema difícil debido al gran espacio de posibilidades y porque la elección óptima depende de muchos factores, como el contenido del resultado de las consultas, la historia de los resultados recientes y el algoritmo de gestión de caché. Cuando un objeto es opaco, el uso de huellas digitales Rabin [8, 30] para detectar datos comunes entre dos objetos se ha mostrado con éxito en el pasado por sistemas como LBFS [26] y Casper [37]. Rabin huellas dactilares utiliza una ventana deslizante sobre los datos para calcular un hash rodante. Suponiendo que la función hash se distribuye uniformemente, se define un límite de fragmento cada vez que los bits de orden inferior del valor hash son igual a algún valor predeterminado. El número de bits de orden inferior utilizado define el tamaño promedio de la fragmentación. Estos fragmentos subdivididos del objeto se convierten en la unidad de comparación para detectar similitud entre diferentes objetos. Como las ubicaciones de los límites encontrados mediante el uso de huellas digitales Rabin se determinan estocásticamente, generalmente no pueden alinearse con las propiedades estructurales de los datos subyacentes. Por lo tanto, el algoritmo se ocupa de las actualizaciones, inserciones y deleciones en el lugar. Sin embargo, funciona mal en presencia de cualquier reordenamiento de datos. La Figura 2 muestra un ejemplo en el que dos resultados, A y B, que constan de tres filas, tienen los mismos datos pero tienen diferentes atributos de tipo. En el caso extremo, las huellas dactilares de Rabin pueden no poder encontrar datos similares debido a la forma en que detecta los límites del fragmento. Afortunadamente, Ganesh puede usar un conocimiento específico del dominio para una detección de límites más precisa. La información que explotamos es que un resultado de consulta refleja la estructura de una base de datos relacional donde todos los datos están organizados como tablas y filas. Por lo tanto, es simple verificar la similitud con resultados anteriores en dos granularidades: primero todo el resultado y luego las filas individuales. El final de una fila en un resultado sirve como un límite de fragmento natural. Es importante tener en cuenta que el uso de la estructura tabular en los resultados solo implica una interpretación superficial de los datos. Ganesh no realiza ninguna interpretación semántica más profunda, como comprender los tipos de datos, el esquema de resultados o las restricciones de integridad. Sintonizar las huellas dactilares de Rabin para una carga de trabajo también puede ser difícil. Si el tamaño promedio de fragmentos es demasiado grande, los trozos pueden abarcar múltiples filas de resultados. Sin embargo, seleccionar un tamaño de fragmento promedio más pequeño aumenta la cantidad de metadatos requeridos para describir los resultados. WWW 2007 / Track: Sesión de rendimiento y escalabilidad: Sistemas escalables para contenido dinámico 312 Figura 2: Huellas dactilares de Rabin vs. Ganeshs Chunning esto, a su vez, disminuiría los ahorros obtenidos a través de su uso. La huella digital de Rabin también necesita dos pases de costo computacional sobre los datos: una vez para determinar los límites de fragmentos y uno nuevamente para generar hashes criptográficos para los trozos. Ganesh solo necesita un solo pase para la generación hash, ya que la estructura natural de los datos proporciona los límites del fragmento. La comparación de rendimiento en la Sección 6 muestra que el algoritmo basado en la fila de Ganesh supera a las huellas dactilares de Rabin. Dado que el trabajo anterior ya ha demostrado que la huella digital de Rabin funciona mejor que GZIP [26], no comparamos los algoritmos de compresión Ganesh en este documento.3.2 Transparencia El factor clave que influyó en nuestro diseño fue la necesidad de que Ganesh fuera completamente transparente para todos los componentes de un sistema de ebusiness típico: servidores web, servidores de aplicaciones y servidores de bases de datos. Sin esto, Ganesh tiene pocas posibilidades de tener un impacto significativo en el mundo real. Requerir modificaciones a cualquiera de los componentes anteriores elevaría la barrera para la entrada de Ganesh en un sistema existente y, por lo tanto, reduciría sus posibilidades de adopción. Preservar la transparencia se simplifica por el hecho de que Ganesh es puramente una mejora del rendimiento, no una funcionalidad o mejora de la usabilidad. Elegimos la interposición del agente como el enfoque arquitectónico para realizar nuestro objetivo. Este enfoque se basa en la existencia de una interfaz de programación compacta que ya es ampliamente utilizada por el software Target. También se basa en un mecanismo para agregar fácilmente un nuevo código sin interrumpir la estructura del módulo existente. Estas condiciones se cumplen fácilmente en nuestro contexto debido a la popularidad de Java como el lenguaje de programación para los sistemas de ébase. La API de conectividad de base de datos Java (JDBC) [32] permite que las aplicaciones Java accedan a una amplia variedad de bases de datos e incluso otros repositorios de datos tabulares, como archivos planos. El acceso a estas fuentes de datos es proporcionado por los controladores JDBC que se traducen entre la API JDBC y el mecanismo de comunicación de la base de datos. La Figura 3 (a) muestra cómo JDBC se usa típicamente en una aplicación. Como la interfaz JDBC está estandarizada, uno puede sustituir un controlador JDBC por otro sin modificaciones de aplicación. El controlador JDBC se convierte así en el módulo natural para explotar para la interposición del código. Como se muestra en la Figura 3 (b), el controlador JDBC nativo se reemplaza con un controlador JDBC Ganesh que presenta la misma interfaz estandarizada. El controlador Ganesh mantiene un alijo en memoria de fragmentos de resultados de consultas anteriores y realiza un reensamblaje de resultados. En la base de datos, agregamos un nuevo proceso llamado proxy de Ganesh. Este proxy, que puede ser compartido por múltiples nodos frontales, consta de dos partes: código para detectar similitud en los fragmentos de resultados y el controlador JDBC nativo original que se comunica con la base de datos. El uso de un proxy en la base de datos hace que la base de datos Ganesh sea agnóstica y simplifica la prototipos y la experimentación. Por lo tanto, Ganesh puede trabajar con una amplia gama de bases de datos y aplicaciones, que no requiere modificaciones a ninguno de los dos.3.3 El almacenamiento en caché basado en el proxy El controlador JDBC nativo que se muestra en la Figura 3 (a) es un componente de código ligero suministrado por el proveedor de la base de datos. Su principal base de datos Funclient Web y el servidor de aplicaciones Native JDBC Wan (a) Arquitectura nativa Base de datos de clientes Ganesh Proxy JDBC JDBC Wan Wan Wan y Servidor de aplicaciones Ganesh JDBC Driver (B) Ganeshs Arquitectura basada en la interposición Figura 3: Native vs. Ganesh arquitectura es IS es espara mediar la comunicación entre la aplicación y la base de datos remota. Reenvía consultas, amortigua los resultados completos y responde a las solicitudes de aplicación para ver partes de los resultados. El controlador Ganesh JDBC que se muestra en la Figura 3 (b) presenta la aplicación con una interfaz idéntica a la proporcionada por el controlador nativo. Proporciona la capacidad de reconstruir los resultados de las descripciones compactas basadas en hash enviadas por el proxy. Para realizar esta reconstrucción, el conductor mantiene un caché en memoria de resultados recientemente recientemente recientemente. Este caché solo se usa como fuente de fragmentos de resultados en la reconstrucción de resultados. El controlador o proxy de Ganesh no se intenta para rastrear las actualizaciones de la base de datos. La falta de consistencia del caché no perjudica la corrección ya que una descripción de los resultados siempre se obtiene del proxy; en el peor de los casos, no habrá beneficio de rendimiento al usar Ganesh. Los datos obsoletos simplemente se superarán del caché con el tiempo. El proxy Ganesh accede a la base de datos a través del controlador JDBC nativo, que permanece sin cambios entre las Figuras 3 (a) y (b). La base de datos no se da cuenta de la existencia del proxy. El proxy no examina ninguna consulta recibida del conductor de Ganesh, sino que las pasa al conductor nativo. En cambio, el proxy es responsable de inspeccionar la salida de la base de datos recibida del controlador nativo, detectar resultados similares y generar codificaciones basadas en hash de estos resultados cuando se encuentra suficiente similitud. Si bien esta arquitectura no disminuye la carga en una base de datos, como se mencionó anteriormente en la Sección 2.1, es mucho más fácil replicar las bases de datos para la escalabilidad en una LAN que en una WAN. Para generar una codificación basada en hash, el proxy debe ser consciente de qué fragmentos de resultados están disponibles en el caché de controladores Ganesh. Un enfoque es ser optimista y suponer que todos los fragmentos de resultados están disponibles. Esto dará como resultado la transmisión inicial más pequeña posible de un resultado. Sin embargo, en los casos en que hay poca superposición con los resultados anteriores, el conductor de Ganesh tendrá que hacer muchas llamadas al poder durante la reconstrucción para obtener fragmentos de resultados faltantes. Para evitar esta situación, el proxy rastrea libremente el estado de la caché de los conductores de Ganesh. Dado que ambos componentes están bajo nuestro control, es relativamente simple hacerlo sin recurrir a técnicas de cajas grises o comunicación explícita para mantener la coherencia de la caché. En cambio, el proxy simula el algoritmo de gestión de caché de los controladores de Ganesh y usa esto para mantener una lista de hashes para los cuales el conductor de Ganesh probablemente posee los fragmentos de resultados. En el caso de la tracking, no habrá pérdida de corrección, pero habrá retrasos adicionales de ida y vuelta para obtener los fragmentos faltantes. Si el cliente detecta la pérdida de sincronización con el proxy, puede pedirle al proxy que restablezca el estado compartido entre ellos. También tenga en cuenta que el proxy no necesita mantener los fragmentos de resultados ellos mismos, solo sus hashes. Esto permite que el proxy permanezca escalable incluso cuando es compartido por muchos nodos frontales. Www 2007 / rastreando: rendimiento y escalabilidad Sesión: sistemas escalables para contenido dinámico 313 SALIDA DE OBJETIVO Convertir Resultset Objeto de entrada Flujo Convertir el conjunto de resultados Todos los datos Receta de datos All Data ResultSet Network Ganesh Proxy Ganesh JDBC Conjunto Conjunto de resultados Conjunto de resultados Conjunto de resultados Sí Sí No No GaneshinputStream GaneshoutputStreamFigura 4: Flujo de datos para el manejo de resultados 3.4 Resultados de codificación y decodificación El proxy de Ganesh recibe la salida de la base de datos como objetos Java del controlador JDBC nativo. Examina esta salida para ver si está presente un objeto Java de Tipo de resultado. La interfaz JDBC utiliza este tipo de datos para almacenar los resultados de las consultas de la base de datos. Si se encuentra un objeto de conjunto de resultados, se reduce como se discute a continuación. Todos los demás objetos Java se pasan a través de no modificados. Como se discutió en la Sección 3.1, el proxy utiliza los límites de fila definidos en el conjunto de resultados para dividirlo en fragmentos que consisten en filas de resultados únicos. Todos los objetos del conjunto de resultados se convierten en objetos de un nuevo tipo llamado ReciperSultSet. Utilizamos el término receta para esta descripción compacta de un resultado de la base de datos debido a su similitud con una receta de archivo en el sistema de archivos CASPER [37]. La conversión reemplaza a cada fragmento de resultados que probablemente esté presente en el caché de los conductores de Ganesh por un hash SHA-1 de ese fragmento. Los fragmentos de resultados previamente invisibles se conservan textualmente. El proxy también conserva los hash para los nuevos fragmentos de resultados, ya que estarán presentes en el caché de los conductores en el futuro. Tenga en cuenta que el proxy solo almacena hash para los fragmentos de resultados y no almacena recetas de almacenamiento en caché. El proxy construye un conjunto de recetas al verificar la similitud en todo el resultado y luego el nivel de fila. Si se predice que todo el resultado estará presente en el caché de los controladores de Ganesh, el receptor de la venta es simplemente un hash único de todo el resultado. De lo contrario, contiene hashes para las filas previstas que están presentes en ese caché;Todas las demás filas se conservan textualmente. Si el proxy estima un ahorro de espacio general, transmitirá el receptor de la venta. De lo contrario, se transmite el conjunto de resultados original. Los objetos ReciperSultSet se transforman nuevamente en los objetos de resultados de resultados por el controlador Ganesh. La Figura 4 ilustra el manejo del conjunto de resultados en ambos extremos. Cada hash SHA-1 que se encuentra en un conjunto de recetas de Cache de fragmentos de resultados locales. En un golpe, el hash se reemplaza por el fragmento correspondiente. En una falla, el conductor contacta al poder de Ganesh para buscar el fragmento. Todos los fragmentos de resultados previamente invisibles que el proxy se retuvo a pie por el proxy y se agregan al caché de resultados. Debería haber muy pocas fallas si el proxy ha rastreado con precisión el estado de caché de los conductores Ganesh. Una optimización futura sería lanzar la obtención de fragmentos faltantes. Esto sería valioso cuando hay muchos pequeños fragmentos faltantes en una WAN de alta latencia. Una vez que se completa la transformación, el objeto de conjunto de resultados totalmente reconstruido se transmite a la aplicación.4. Validación experimental Tres preguntas se deducen de los objetivos y el diseño de Ganesh: • Primero, ¿se puede mejorar significativamente al explotar la similitud entre los resultados de la base de datos? Detalles del conjunto de datos de referencia 500,000 usuarios, 12,000 historias Bboard 2.0 GB 3,298,000 Comentarios Subasta 1.3 GB 1,000,000 Usuarios, 34,000 elementos Tabla 1: Detalles del conjunto de datos de referencia • Segundo, ¿qué tan importante es la detección de similitud estructural de Ganeshs relativo a las huellas dedo de Rabin Detección de similitud?• Tercero, ¿es aceptable la sobrecarga del diseño basado en el poder? Nuestra evaluación responde a estas preguntas a través de experimentos controlados con el prototipo Ganesh. Esta sección describe los puntos de referencia utilizados, nuestro procedimiento de evaluación y la configuración experimental. Los resultados de los experimentos se presentan en las Secciones 5, 6 y 7. 4.1 puntos de referencia Nuestra evaluación se basa en dos puntos de referencia [18] que otros investigadores han utilizado ampliamente para evaluar varios aspectos de las arquitecturas de múltiples niveles y ebusiness [9]. El primer punto de referencia, Bboard, se modela después de Slashdot, un sitio de noticias orientado a la tecnología. El segundo punto de referencia, la subasta, se modela después de eBay, un sitio de subastas en línea. En ambos puntos de referencia, la mayoría del contenido se genera dinámicamente a partir de la información almacenada en una base de datos. Los detalles de los conjuntos de datos utilizados se pueden encontrar en la Tabla 1. 4.1.1 El punto de referencia Bboard El punto de referencia Bboard, también conocido como Rubbos [18], Models Slashdot, un sitio web popular orientado a la tecnología. SlashDot agregue los enlaces a noticias y otros temas de interés que se encuentran en otras partes de la web. El sitio también sirve como un tablón de anuncios al permitir a los usuarios comentar las historias publicadas en un formulario de conversación enhebrada. No es raro que una historia reúna cientos de comentarios en cuestión de horas. El punto de referencia Bboard es similar al sitio y modela las actividades de un usuario, incluidas las operaciones de lectura, como navegar por las historias del día, navegar por las categorías de historias y ver comentarios, así como operaciones de escritura, como el registro de nuevos usuarios, agregar y moderar comentarios.y sumisión de historia. El punto de referencia consta de tres fases diferentes: una fase de calentamiento corta, una fase de tiempo de ejecución que representa el cuerpo principal de la carga de trabajo y una fase de enfriamiento corta. En este artículo solo informamos los resultados de la fase de tiempo de ejecución. La fase de calentamiento es importante para establecer el estado del sistema dinámico, pero las mediciones de esa fase no son significativas para nuestra evaluación. La fase de enfriamiento es únicamente para permitir que el punto de referencia se cierre. El calentamiento, el tiempo de ejecución y las fases de enfriamiento son 2, 15 y 2 minutos respectivamente. El número de clientes simulados fue 400, 800, 1200 y 1600. El punto de referencia está disponible en una versión de Java Servlets y PHP y tiene diferentes conjuntos de datos;Evaluamos a Ganesh usando la versión Java Servlets y el conjunto de datos expandido. El punto de referencia Bboard define dos cargas de trabajo diferentes. El primero, la mezcla de autor, consta de operaciones de solo lectura del 70% y el 30% de operaciones de lectura-escritura. El segundo, la mezcla de navegación, contiene solo operaciones de solo lectura y no actualiza la base de datos.4.1.2 El punto de referencia de la subasta El punto de referencia de la subasta, también conocido como Rubis [18], Models eBay, el sitio de subastas en línea. El sitio web de eBay se utiliza para comprar y vender artículos a través de un formato de subasta. Las principales actividades de un usuario incluyen navegar, vender o ofertar por artículos. Modelado las actividades en este sitio, este punto de referencia incluye actividades de solo lectura, como los elementos de navegación por categoría y por región, así como lectura-escritura www 2007 / pista: sesión de rendimiento y escalabilidad: sistemas escalables para contenido dinámico 314 netem enrutador ganesh proxyCLIENTES SERVICIO DE BASE DE LA WEB y APLICACIÓN SERVICIO Figura 5: Actividades de configuración experimentales, como ofertar por artículos, comprar y vender artículos, y dejar comentarios. Al igual que con Bboard, el punto de referencia consta de tres fases diferentes. Las fases de calentamiento, tiempo de ejecución y enfriamiento para este experimento son 1.5, 15 y 1 minutos respectivamente. Probamos a Ganesh con cuatro configuraciones de clientes donde el número de clientes de prueba se estableció en 400, 800, 1200 y 1600. El punto de referencia está disponible en un Enterprise Java Bean (EJB), Servlets Java y la versión PHP y tiene diferentes conjuntos de datos;Evaluamos a Ganesh con la versión Java Servlets y el conjunto de datos ampliado. El punto de referencia de subastas define dos cargas de trabajo diferentes. El primero, la mezcla de ofertas, consta de operaciones de solo lectura del 70% y del 30% de operaciones de lectura-escritura. El segundo, la mezcla de navegación, contiene solo operaciones de solo lectura y no actualiza la base de datos.4.2 Procedimiento experimental Ambos puntos de referencia implican una carga de trabajo sintética de clientes que acceden a un servidor web. El número de clientes emulados es un parámetro experimental. Cada cliente emulado ejecuta una instancia del punto de referencia en su propio hilo, utilizando una matriz para hacer la transición entre diferentes estados de referencia. La matriz define un modelo estocástico con probabilidades de transición entre los diferentes estados que representan acciones de usuario típicas. Una transición de ejemplo es un usuario que inicia sesión en el sistema de subastas y luego decide si debe publicar un artículo para la venta o ofertar en subastas activas. Cada cliente también modela el tiempo de pensamiento del usuario entre solicitudes. El tiempo de Think se modela como una distribución exponencial con una media de 7 segundos. Evaluamos a Ganesh a lo largo de dos ejes: número de clientes y ancho de banda WAN. Las cargas más altas son especialmente útiles para comprender el rendimiento de Ganeshs cuando la CPU o el disco del servidor de la base de datos o proxy es el factor limitante. Un estudio anterior ha demostrado que aproximadamente el 50% de los cuellos de botella de Internet de área amplia observados tenían un ancho de banda disponible por debajo de 10 MB/s [1]. Según este trabajo, centramos nuestra evaluación en el ancho de banda WAN de 5 MB/s con 66 ms de latencia de ida y vuelta, representante de rutas de red severamente limitadas y 20 MB/s con 33 ms de latencia de viaje redondo, representante deuna ruta de red moderadamente limitada. También informamos el rendimiento de Ganeshs a 100 MB/s sin latencia de ida y vuelta agregada. Este ancho de banda, representativo de una red no restringida, es especialmente útil para revelar cualquier potencial de Ganesh en situaciones donde el ancho de banda WAN no es el factor limitante. Para cada combinación de número de clientes y ancho de banda WAN, medimos los resultados de las dos configuraciones enumeradas a continuación: • Nativo: esta configuración corresponde a la Figura 3 (a). Native evita a Ganeshs sobre la cabeza en el uso de un proxy y la realización de objetos de Java.• Ganesh: esta configuración corresponde a la Figura 3 (b). Para un número determinado de clientes y ancho de banda WAN, la comparación de estos resultados con los resultados nativos correspondientes ofrece el beneficio de rendimiento debido al sistema de middleware Ganesh. La métrica utilizada para cuantificar la mejora en el rendimiento es el número de solicitudes de clientes que pueden ser atendidas por segundo. La métrica utilizada para cuantificar la sobrecarga de Ganeshs es el tiempo de respuesta promedio para una solicitud del cliente. Para todos los experimentos, el controlador Ganesh utilizado por el servidor de aplicaciones utilizó un tamaño de caché de 100,000 elementos1. El proxy fue efectivo para rastrear el estado de caché de los conductores Ganesh;Para todos nuestros experimentos, la tasa de fallas en el conductor nunca excedió el 0.7%.4.3 Configuración experimental La configuración experimental utilizada para los puntos de referencia se puede ver en la Figura 5. Todas las máquinas eran Pentium 4S de 3.2 GHz (con hyperthreading habilitado). Con la excepción del servidor de la base de datos, todas las máquinas tenían 2 GB de SDRAM y ejecutaban la distribución Fedora Core Linux. El servidor de la base de datos tenía 4 GB de SDRAM. Utilizamos Apaches Tomcat como el servidor de aplicaciones que alojó los servlets Java y el servidor web. Ambos puntos de referencia utilizaron servlets Java para generar el contenido dinámico. El servidor de la base de datos utilizó la base de datos MySQL de código abierto. Para los controladores JDBC nativos, utilizamos los controladores Connector/J proporcionados por MySQL. El servidor de aplicaciones utilizó Suns Java Virtual Machine como el entorno de tiempo de ejecución para los servlets Java. La herramienta SysStat se utilizó para monitorear la CPU, la red, el disco y la utilización de la memoria en todas las máquinas. Las máquinas estaban conectadas por una red de Gigabit Ethernet conmutada. Como se muestra en la Figura 5, la web y el servidor de aplicaciones frontal se separaron del servidor proxy y de la base de datos por un enrutador Netem [16]. Este enrutador nos permitió controlar el ancho de banda y la configuración de latencia en la red. El enrutador Netem es una PC estándar con dos tarjetas de red que ejecutan el software de control de tráfico y emulación de red de Linux. El ancho de banda y las restricciones de latencia solo se aplicaron al enlace entre el servidor de aplicaciones y la base de datos para el caso nativo y entre el servidor de aplicaciones y el proxy para el caso Ganesh. No hay comunicación entre el servidor de aplicaciones y la base de datos con Ganesh a medida que todos los datos fluyen a través del proxy. Como nuestro enfoque estaba en el enlace WAN entre el servidor de aplicaciones y la base de datos, no había restricciones en el enlace entre los clientes de prueba simulados y el servidor web.5. Tiempo de rendimiento y respuesta En esta sección, abordamos la primera pregunta planteada en la Sección 4: ¿Puede el rendimiento se puede mejorar significativamente al explotar la similitud entre los resultados de la base de datos? Para responder a esta pregunta, utilizamos los resultados del bordero y los puntos de referencia de subastas. Utilizamos dos métricas para cuantificar la mejora del rendimiento que se puede obtener mediante el uso de Ganesh: rendimiento, desde la perspectiva del servidor web y el tiempo de respuesta promedio, desde la perspectiva del cliente. El rendimiento se mide en términos de la cantidad de solicitudes de clientes que pueden ser atendidas por segundo.5.1 Resultados y análisis de bordero 5.1.1 Autorando las Figuras de la mezcla 6 (a) y (b) presentan el número promedio de solicitudes atendidas por segundo y el tiempo de respuesta promedio para estas solicitudes según lo perciben los clientes para la mezcla de autor de los clientes. Como muestra la Figura 6 (a), el nativo satura fácilmente el enlace de 5 MB/S. Con 400 clientes, la solución nativa ofrece 29 solicitudes/seg con un tiempo de respuesta promedio de 8.3 segundos. El rendimiento de los nativos cae con un aumento en los clientes de prueba como tiempo de espera de los clientes debido a la congestión en el servidor de aplicaciones. Los estudios de usabilidad han demostrado que los tiempos de respuesta superiores a los 10 segundos hacen que el usuario pase a 1 ya que Java carece de un operador sizeOf (), los cachés de Java limitan su tamaño en función de la cantidad de objetos. El tamaño de los vertederos de caché tomados al final de los experimentos nunca excedió los 212 MB.

La desviación estándar máxima para el rendimiento y el tiempo de respuesta fue del 9.8% y el 11.9% de la media correspondiente. Figura 6: punto de referencia Bboard: rendimiento y tiempo de respuesta promedio otras tareas [24]. Según estos números, aumentar el número de clientes de prueba hace que el sistema nativo sea inutilizable. Sin embargo, Ganesh a 5 MB/s ofrece una mejora doble con 400 clientes de prueba y una mejora de cinco veces a 1200 clientes. El rendimiento de Ganeshs cae ligeramente a 1200 y 1600 clientes, ya que la red está saturada. En comparación con los nativos, la Figura 6 (b) muestra que los tiempos de respuesta de Ganeshs son sustancialmente más bajos con los tiempos de respuesta subsecondios a 400 clientes. La Figura 6 (a) también muestra que para 400 y 800 clientes de prueba Ganesh a 5 MB/s tienen el mismo rendimiento y tiempo de respuesta promedio que nativo a 20 MB/s. Solo a 1200 y 1600 clientes nativos a 20 MB/s ofrecen un rendimiento más alto que Ganesh a 5 MB/s. Comparando tanto a Ganesh como a nativo a 20 MB/s, vemos que Ganesh ya no está limitado y ofrece una mejora doble sobre nativo en 1600 clientes de prueba. Como Ganesh no satura la red con configuraciones de clientes de prueba más alta, a 1600 clientes de prueba, su tiempo de respuesta promedio es de 0.1 segundos en lugar de nativos 7.7 segundos. Como se esperaba, no hay ganancias visibles de Ganesh en el mayor ancho de banda de 100 MB/s, donde la red ya no es el cuello de botella. Ganesh, sin embargo, todavía rastrea nativo en términos de rendimiento.5.1.2 Figuras de mezcla de navegación 6 (c) y (d) Presentan el número promedio de solicitudes atendidas por segundo y el tiempo de respuesta promedio para estas solicitudes según lo perciben los clientes para la mezcla de navegación de Bboards. Independientemente de la configuración del cliente de prueba, la Figura 6 (c) muestra que el rendimiento de los nativos a 5 MB/s está limitado a 10 reqs/seg. Ganesh a 5 MB/s con 400 clientes de prueba, ofrece más de un aumento de seis veces en el rendimiento. La mejora aumenta a un aumento de once veces a los 800 clientes de prueba antes de que Ganesh sature la red. Además, la Figura 6 (d) muestra que el tiempo de respuesta promedio de los nativos de 35 segundos a 400 clientes de prueba hace que el sistema sea inutilizable. Estos altos tiempos de respuesta aumentan aún más con la adición de clientes de prueba. Incluso con la configuración del cliente de la prueba 1600, Ganesh ofrece un tiempo de respuesta promedio aceptable de 8.2 segundos. Debido a la naturaleza intensiva de datos de la mezcla de navegación, Ganesh a 5 MB/s sorprendentemente funciona mucho mejor que el nativo a 20 MB/s. Además, como se muestra en la Figura 6 (d), mientras que el tiempo de respuesta promedio para nativo a 20 MB/s es aceptable a 400 clientes de prueba, no es utilizado con 800 clientes de prueba con un tiempo de respuesta promedio de 15.8 segundos. Al igual que el caso de 5 MB/S, este tiempo de respuesta aumenta con la adición de clientes de prueba adicionales. Ganesh a 20 MB/s y tanto nativo como Ganesh a 100 MB/s no tienen un ancho de banda limitado. Sin embargo, el rendimiento se saturó después de 1200 clientes de prueba debido a que la CPU de la base de datos está saturada.5.1.3 Variante del filtro Nos sorprendió el rendimiento nativo del punto de referencia Bboard. En el ancho de banda de 5 MB/s, el rendimiento nativo fue más bajo de lo que esperábamos. Resultó que el código de referencia que muestra historias lee todos los comentarios asociados con la historia particular de la base de datos y solo entonces hizo algún postprocesamiento para seleccionar los comentarios que se mostrarán. Si bien este es exactamente el comportamiento de SlashCode, la base de código detrás del sitio web de Slashdot, decidimos modificar el punto de referencia para realizar un poco de filtrado en la base de datos. Este punto de referencia modificado, llamado la variante de filtro, modela un desarrollador que aplica optimizaciones a nivel SQL para transferir menos datos. En aras de la brevedad, solo resumimos brevemente los resultados de la mezcla de autoridad. Para la mezcla de autoridad, a 800 clientes de prueba a 5 MB/s, la Figura 7 (a) muestra que el rendimiento de los nativos aumenta en un 85% en comparación con el punto de referencia original, mientras que la mejora de Ganeshs es menor con un 15%. El rendimiento de los nativos cae por encima de los 800 clientes a medida que los clientes de la prueba tienen tiempo para el tiempo debido a los altos tiempos de respuesta. La ganancia más significativa para nativa se observa a 20 MB/s. Con 1600 clientes de prueba, en comparación con el punto de referencia original, Native ve una mejora del 73% en el rendimiento y una reducción del 77% en el tiempo de respuesta promedio.

Figura 7: Benchmark Bboard - Variante de filtro - Rendimiento y tiempo de respuesta promedio que Ganesh no ve una mejora en comparación con el original, todavía procesa un 19% más de solicitudes/seg que nativas. Por lo tanto, si bien las optimizaciones fueron más útiles para los nativos, Ganesh aún ofrece una mejora en el rendimiento.5.2 Resultados y análisis de la subasta 5.2.1 Bid de la mezcla de la mezcla 8 (a) y (b) presentan el número promedio de solicitudes atendidas por segundo y el tiempo de respuesta promedio para estas solicitudes según lo perciben los clientes para la mezcla de ofertas de subastas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, la mezcla de ofertas consiste en una mezcla de operaciones de lectura y escritura. El punto de referencia de subastas no es tan intensivo en los datos como Bboard. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de las ganancias se observan en el ancho de banda inferior de 5 MB/s. La Figura 8 (a) muestra que el aumento en el rendimiento debido a Ganesh varía del 8% a los 400 clientes de prueba al 18% con 1600 clientes de prueba. Como se ve en la Figura 8 (b), los tiempos de respuesta promedio para Ganesh son significativamente más bajos que los nativos que van desde una disminución del 84% a los 800 clientes de prueba hasta 88% a los clientes de prueba de 1600. La Figura 8 (a) también muestra que con un aumento cuatro veces del ancho de banda de 5 MB/s a 20 MB/s, el nativo ya no está limitado y no hay diferencia de rendimiento entre Ganesh y Native. Con las configuraciones del cliente de prueba más alta, observamos que el ancho de banda utilizado por Ganesh era más bajo que el nativo. Ganesh podría ser útil en estos escenarios no restringidos si el ancho de banda se compra de forma medida. Se observan resultados similares para el escenario de 100 MB/s.5.2.2 Mezcla de navegación para subastas Mezcla de navegación, Figuras 8 (c) y (d) presentan el número promedio de solicitudes atendidas por segundo y el tiempo de respuesta promedio para estas solicitudes según lo perciben los clientes. Nuevamente, la mayoría de las ganancias se observan en anchos de banda más bajos. A 5 MB/s, Native y Ganesh ofrecen tiempos de rendimiento y respuesta similares con 400 clientes de prueba. Si bien el rendimiento para ambos sigue siendo el mismo en 800 clientes de prueba, la Figura 8 (d) muestra que el tiempo de respuesta promedio de Ganeshs es 62% más bajo que el nativo. Nativo satura el enlace a 800 clientes y agregar clientes de prueba adicionales solo aumenta el tiempo de respuesta promedio. Ganesh, independientemente de la configuración del cliente de prueba, no se limita al ancho de banda y mantiene el mismo tiempo de respuesta. En 1600 clientes de prueba, la Figura 8 (c) muestra que el rendimiento de Ganeshs es casi el doble que el nativo. En los anchos de banda más altos de 20 y 100 MB/s, ni Ganesh ni Native son un ancho de banda limitado y ofrecen tiempos de rendimiento y respuesta equivalentes. Benchmark Orig. Tamaño Ganesh Tamaño Rabin Tamaño SelectSort1 223.6 MB 5.4 MB 219.3 MB SelectSort2 223.6 MB 5.4 MB 223.6 MB Tabla 2: Microbistios de similitud 6. Estructural vs.La similitud de Rabin En esta sección, abordamos la segunda pregunta planteada en la Sección 4: ¿Qué tan importante es la detección de similitud estructural de Ganeshs en relación con la detección de similitud basada en huellas dactilares de Rabin? Para responder a esta pregunta, utilizamos MicrobenchMigns y los puntos de referencia Bboard y Subasta. Como Ganesh siempre funcionó mejor que las huellas dactilares de Rabin, solo presentamos un subconjunto de los resultados aquí en interés de la brevedad.6.1 Microbenchmars Dos microbistres muestran un ejemplo de los efectos de la reordenamiento de datos en el algoritmo de huellas dactilares de Rabin. En el primer Microbenchmark, SelectSort1, una consulta con una orden de clasificación especificada selecciona 223.6 MB de datos distribuidos en aproximadamente 280 K filas. La consulta se repite con un atributo de tipo diferente. Si bien se devuelven el mismo número de filas y los mismos datos, el orden de las filas es diferente. En tal escenario, uno esperaría que se detecte una gran cantidad de similitud entre ambos resultados. Como muestra la Tabla 2, el algoritmo basado en la fila de Ganeshs logra una reducción del 97.6%, mientras que el algoritmo de huellas dactilares de Rabin, con el parámetro promedio de tamaño de fragmento establecido en 4 KB, solo logra una reducción del 1%. La razón, como se muestra anteriormente en la Figura 2, es que con las huellas dactilares de Rabin, los tramos de datos entre dos límites consecutivos generalmente cruzan los límites de la fila. Con el orden de las filas que cambian en el segundo resultado y las huellas digitales de Rabin ahora abarcan diferentes filas, el algoritmo no puede detectar una similitud significativa. La pequeña ganancia vista es principalmente para aquellas filas individuales que son lo suficientemente grandes como para romperse en múltiples trozos. SelectSort2, otro micro-benchmark ejecutó las mismas consultas pero aumentó el tamaño mínimo de la fragmentación del algoritmo de huellas dactilares Rabin. Como se puede ver en la Tabla 2, incluso la pequeña ganancia del Microbenchmark anterior desaparece ya que el tamaño mínimo de fragmentos fue mayor que el tamaño promedio de la fila. Si bien uno puede abordar parcialmente estos problemas variando dinámicamente los parámetros del algoritmo de huellas dactilares Rabin, esto puede ser computacionalmente costoso, especialmente en presencia de cambios de trabajo cambiantes.6.2 Los puntos de referencia de aplicaciones ejecutamos el punto de referencia Bboard descrito en la Sección 4.1.1 en dos versiones de Ganesh: la primera con huellas dactilares de Rabin utilizados como www 2007 / pista: sesión de rendimiento y escalabilidad: sistemas escalables para contenido dinámico 317 0 50 100 150 200 250 300350 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 MB/S 20 MB/S 100 MB/S Solicitudes de clientes de prueba/seg nativo Ganesh 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 5MB/S 20 MB/S 100 MB/S CLIENTES DE PRUEBA AVG.RESP.TIME (SEC) Native Ganesh Note logscale (a) Rendimiento: Mezcla de licitación (B) Tiempo de respuesta: Mezcla de oferta 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 800 800 8001200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 MB/S 20 MB/S 100 MB/S Solicitudes de clientes de prueba/seg nativo Ganesh 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 MB/S20 MB/S 100 MB/S CLIENTES DE PRUEBA AVG.ESP.TIME (SEC) Native Ganesh Note logscale (c) rendimiento: mezcla de navegación (d) Tiempo de respuesta: la mezcla de navegación media de tres ensayos.

Figura 8: Benchmark de subasta: rendimiento y tiempo de respuesta promedio El algoritmo de fragmentación y el segundo con el algoritmo basado en la fila de Ganeshs. Los resultados de Rabins para la mezcla de navegación se normalizan a los resultados de Ganeshs y se presentan en la Figura 9. Como muestra la Figura 9 (a), a 5 MB/s, independientemente de la configuración del cliente de prueba, Rabin influye significativamente en Ganesh. Esto sucede debido a una combinación de dos razones. Primero, como se describe en la Sección 3.1, Rabin encuentra menos similitud ya que no explota los resultados de la información estructural. En segundo lugar, este punto de referencia contenía algunas consultas que generaban grandes resultados. En este caso, Rabin, con un pequeño tamaño de fragmento promedio, generó una gran cantidad de objetos que desalojan otros datos útiles del caché. En contraste, Ganesh pudo detectar estas grandes filas y aumentar correspondientemente el tamaño de los trozos. Esto se confirmó ya que las estadísticas de caché mostraron que la relación Ganeshs HIT fue aproximadamente tres veces la de Rabin. Las mediciones de rendimiento a 20 MB/s fueron similares con la excepción del rendimiento de Rabins con 400 clientes de prueba. En este caso, Ganesh no estaba limitado en la red y, de hecho, el rendimiento era el mismo que 400 clientes a 5 MB/s. Rabin, sin embargo, aprovechó el aumento del ancho de banda de 5 a 20 MB/s para ofrecer un rendimiento ligeramente mejor. A 100 MB/s, el rendimiento de Rabins era casi similar al de Ganesh, ya que el ancho de banda ya no era un cuello de botella. El tiempo de respuesta normalizado, presentado en la Figura 9 (b), muestra tendencias similares. A 5 y 20 MB/s, la adición de clientes de prueba disminuye el tiempo de respuesta normalizado a medida que el tiempo de respuesta promedio de Ganesh aumenta más rápido que Rabins. Sin embargo, en ningún momento Rabin supera a Ganesh. Tenga en cuenta que a 400 y 800 clientes a 100 MB/s, Rabin tiene una sobrecarga más alta incluso cuando no está limitado. Como se menciona en la Sección 3.1, esto se debe al hecho de que Rabin tiene que hash cada resultado de resultados dos veces. La sobrecarga desaparece con 1200 y 1600 clientes, ya que la CPU de la base de datos está saturada y limita el rendimiento de Ganesh y Rabin.7. Overhead proxy En esta sección, abordamos la tercera pregunta planteada en la Sección 4: ¿Es aceptable la sobrecarga del diseño basado en el poder de Ganeshs? Para responder a esta pregunta, nos concentramos en su rendimiento en los anchos de banda más altos. Nuestra evaluación en la Sección 5 mostró que Ganesh, en comparación con Native, puede ofrecer una mejora sustancial de rendimiento a anchos de banda más bajos. Es solo a anchos de banda más altos que la latencia, medida por el tiempo de respuesta promedio para una solicitud del cliente, y el rendimiento, medido por la cantidad de solicitudes de clientes que se pueden atender por segundo, se verían visibles. Mirando la mezcla de autoría del punto de referencia original de Bboard, no hay ganancias visibles de Ganesh a 100 MB/s. Ganesh, sin embargo, todavía rastrea nativo en términos de rendimiento. Si bien el tiempo de respuesta promedio es más alto para Ganesh, la diferencia absoluta está entre 0.01 y 0.04 segundos y sería imperceptible para el usuario final. La mezcla de navegación muestra una diferencia aún menor en los tiempos de respuesta promedio. Los resultados de la variante de filtro de los puntos de referencia Bboard son similares. Incluso para el punto de referencia de subastas, la diferencia entre el tiempo de respuesta nativo y de Ganesh a 100 MB/s nunca fue mayor de 0.02 segundos. La única excepción a los resultados anteriores se observó en la variante del filtro del punto de referencia Bboard donde Ganesh en 1600 clientes de prueba agregaron 0.85 segundos al tiempo de respuesta promedio. Por lo tanto, incluso para redes mucho más rápidas donde el enlace WAN no es el cuello de botella, Ganesh siempre ofrece un rendimiento equivalente a nativo. Si bien el diseño basado en el poder agrega cierta latencia adicional, generalmente es imperceptible.8. El trabajo relacionado con todo el conocimiento, Ganesh es el primer sistema que combina el uso de técnicas basadas en el hash con el almacenamiento en caché de los resultados de la base de datos para mejorar los tiempos de rendimiento y respuesta para aplicaciones con contenido dinámico.

Figura 9: Comparación normalizada de Ganesh vs. Rabin - BORRADA BLOBE DE BROWSING Detección de similitud. En esta sección, primero discutimos enfoques alternativos para almacenar en caché el contenido dinámico y luego examinamos otros usos de las primitivas basadas en el hash en los sistemas distribuidos.8.1 El contenido dinámico de almacenamiento en caché en la capa de base de datos, varios sistemas han abogado por el almacenamiento en caché de Middletier donde las partes de la base de datos se replican en el borde o servidor [3, 4, 20]. Estos sistemas almacenan en caché las tablas enteras en lo que es esencialmente una base de datos replicada o utilizan vistas materializadas de las respuestas de consulta anteriores [19]. Requieren una integración estrecha con la base de datos de back-end para garantizar un tiempo limitado a la propagación de actualizaciones. Estos sistemas también generalmente están dirigidos a cargas de trabajo que no requieren una consistencia estricta y pueden tolerar datos obsoletos. Además, a diferencia de Ganesh, algunas de estas soluciones de almacenamiento en caché de nivel medio [2, 3], sufren la complejidad de tener que participar en el procesamiento de la consulta y el procesamiento de consultas distribuidas. Gao et al.[15] propone el uso de una arquitectura de replicación de objetos distribuidos donde los requisitos de consistencia de los almacenes de datos se adaptan por aplicación. Estas soluciones requieren recursos sustanciales del desarrollador y una comprensión detallada de la aplicación que se está modificando. Si bien existen sistemas que intentan automatizar la partición y replicación de una base de datos de aplicaciones [34], no proporcionan semántica de transacciones completa. En comparación, Ganesh no debilita ninguna de las semánticas proporcionadas por la base de datos subyacente. El trabajo reciente en la evaluación de opciones de almacenamiento en caché de borde para sitios web dinámicos [38] ha sugerido que, sin una planificación cuidadosa, emplear estrategias de descarga complejas puede dañar el rendimiento. En cambio, el trabajo aboga por una arquitectura en la que todos los niveles, excepto la base de datos, se deben descargar al borde. Nuestra evaluación de Ganesh ha demostrado que beneficiaría a estos escenarios. Para mejorar la escalabilidad de las bases de datos, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22] y Ganymed [28] también abogan por el uso de una arquitectura basada en interposiciones para agrupar transparentemente y replicar las bases de datos a nivel de middleware. Los enfoques de estas arquitecturas y Ganesh son complementarios y se beneficiarían entre sí. Avanzando a la capa de presentación, ha habido una adopción generalizada del almacenamiento en caché basado en fragmentos [14], lo que mejora la utilización de caché al almacenar en caché por separado diferentes partes de las páginas web generadas. Mientras que el almacenamiento en caché basado en fragmentos funciona en The Edge, una propuesta reciente ha propuesto un ensamblaje de página web en movimiento a los clientes para optimizar la entrega de contenido [31]. Si bien Ganesh no se usa en la capa de presentación, se han aplicado los mismos principios en la detección de transferencias duplicadas [25] para aumentar la eficiencia del caché web, así como para el acceso web a través de enlaces limitados de ancho de banda [33].8.2 Los sistemas basados en hash en los últimos años han visto la aparición de muchos sistemas que explotan las técnicas basadas en el hash. En el corazón de todos estos sistemas está la idea de detectar similitud en los datos sin requerir la interpretación de esos datos. Esta idea simple pero elegante se basa en el hash criptográfico, como se discutió anteriormente en la Sección 2. Las aplicaciones exitosas de esta idea abarcan una amplia gama de sistemas de almacenamiento. Los ejemplos incluyen la copia de seguridad entre pares de archivos informáticos personales [11], archivo de datos de almacenamiento-eficiente [29] y encontrar archivos similares [21]. Spring y Wetherall [35] aplican principios similares a nivel de red. Utilizando cachés sincronizados en ambos extremos de un enlace de red, los datos duplicados se reemplazan por tokens más pequeños para la transmisión y luego se restauran en el extremo remoto. Este y otros sistemas basados en hash, como los sistemas de archivos Casper [37] y LBFS [26], y los optimizadores de ancho de banda de capa 2, como el lecho del río y el peribit, usan huellas dactilares de Rabin [30] para descubrir tramos de comunicación en los datos. Este enfoque es especialmente útil cuando los elementos de datos se modifican en el lugar a través de inserciones, deleciones y actualizaciones. Sin embargo, como muestra la Sección 6, el rendimiento de esta técnica puede mostrar una caída dramática en la presencia de reordenamiento de datos. En cambio, Ganesh usa límites de fila como divisores para detectar similitud. El uso más agresivo de las técnicas basadas en hash es por sistemas que utilizan hashes como identificadores principales para objetos en almacenamiento persistente. Los sistemas de almacenamiento como CFS [12] y pasado [13] que se han construido utilizando tablas de hash distribuidas entran en esta categoría. El almacenamiento de una sola instancia [6] y Venti [29] son otros ejemplos de tales sistemas. Como se discutió en la Sección 2.2, el uso de hashes criptográficos para abordar los datos persistentes representa un nivel más profundo de fe en su resistencia de colisión que el asumido por Ganesh. Si el tiempo revela deficiencias en el algoritmo hash, el esfuerzo involucrado en corregir el defecto es mucho mayor. En Ganesh, se trata simplemente de reemplazar el algoritmo hash.9. Conclusión El uso creciente del contenido web dinámico generado a partir de bases de datos relacionales coloca mayores demandas sobre el ancho de banda WAN. Las soluciones tradicionales de almacenamiento en caché para el ancho de banda y la reducción de la latencia a menudo son ineficaces para dicho contenido. Este documento muestra que el impacto de los accesos de WAN a las bases de datos puede reducirse sustancialmente a través de la arquitectura de Ganesh sin ningún compromiso de la estricta semántica de consistencia de las bases de datos. La esencia de la arquitectura de Ganesh es el uso del cálculo en los bordes para reducir la comunicación a través de Internet. Ganesh puede usar hashes criptográficos para detectar la similitud con resultados anteriores y enviar www 2007 / rastrear: sesión de rendimiento y escalabilidad: sistemas escalables para contenido dinámico 319 recetas compactas de resultados en lugar de resultados completos. Nuestro diseño utiliza la interposición para lograr una transparencia completa: los clientes, los servidores de aplicaciones y los servidores de bases de datos desconocen la presencia de Ganeshs y no requieren modificación. Nuestra evaluación experimental confirma que Ganesh, aunque conceptualmente simple, puede ser altamente efectiva para mejorar el rendimiento y el tiempo de respuesta. Nuestros resultados también confirman que explotar la estructura presente en los resultados de la base de datos para detectar la similitud es crucial para esta mejora del rendimiento.10.

        "Further, Ganesh does not require modifications to applications, web servers, or database servers, and works with closed-source applications and databases.",
        "Using two benchmarks representative of dynamic web sites, measurements of our prototype show that it can increase end-to-end throughput by as much as twofold for non-data intensive applications and by as much as tenfold for data intensive ones.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication Networks]: Distributed Systems; H.2.4 [Database Management]: Systems General Terms Design, Performance 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION An increasing fraction of web content is dynamically generated from back-end relational databases.",
        "Even when database content remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors.",
        "In a multitiered architecture, each web request can stress the WAN link between the web server and the database.",
        "This causes user experience to be highly variable because there is no caching to insulate the client from bursty loads.",
        "Previous attempts in caching dynamic database content have generally weakened transactional semantics [3, 4] or required application modifications [15, 34].",
        "We report on a new solution that takes the form of a databaseagnostic middleware layer called Ganesh.",
        "Ganesh makes no effort to semantically interpret the contents of queries or their results.",
        "Instead, it relies exclusively on cryptographic hashing to detect similarities with previous results.",
        "Hash-based similarity detection has seen increasing use in distributed file systems [26, 36, 37] for improving performance on low-bandwidth networks.",
        "However, these techniques have not been used for relational databases.",
        "Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement.",
        "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
        "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
        "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
        "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",
        "Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.",
        "Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available.",
        "This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code.",
        "Our experiments show that Ganesh, while conceptually simple, can improve performance significantly at bandwidths representative of todays commercial Internet.",
        "On benchmarks modeling multitiered web applications, the throughput improvement was as high as tenfold for data-intensive workloads.",
        "For workloads that were not data-intensive, throughput improvements of up to twofold were observed.",
        "Even when bandwidth was not a constraint, Ganesh had low overhead and did not hurt performance.",
        "Our experiments also confirm that exploiting the structure present in database results is crucial to this performance improvement. 2.",
        "BACKGROUND 2.1 Dynamic Content Generation As the World Wide Web has grown, many web sites have decentralized their data and functionality by pushing them to the edges of the Internet.",
        "Today, eBusiness systems often use a three-tiered architecture consisting of a front-end web server, an application server, and a back-end database server.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates this architecture.",
        "The first two tiers can be replicated close to a concentration of clients at the edge of the Internet.",
        "This improves user experience by lowering end-to-end latency and reducing exposure WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 311 Back-End Database Server Front-End Web and Application Servers Figure 1: Multi-Tier Architecture to backbone traffic congestion.",
        "It can also increase the availability and scalability of web services.",
        "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
        "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
        "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
        "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
        "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
        "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
        "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
        "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
        "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
        "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
        "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
        "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
        "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
        "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
        "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
        "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
        "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
        "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
        "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
        "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
        "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
        "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
        "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
        "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
        "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
        "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
        "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
        "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
        "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
        "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
        "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
        "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
        "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
        "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
        "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
        "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
        "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
        "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
        "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
        "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
        "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
        "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
        "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
        "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
        "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
        "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
        "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
        "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
        "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
        "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
        "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
        "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
        "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
        "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
        "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
        "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
        "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
        "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
        "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
        "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
        "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
        "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
        "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
        "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
        "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
        "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
        "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
        "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
        "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
        "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
        "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
        "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
        "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
        "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
        "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
        "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
        "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
        "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
        "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
        "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
        "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
        "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
        "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
        "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
        "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
        "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
        "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
        "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
        "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
        "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
        "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
        "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
        "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
        "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
        "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
        "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
        "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
        "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
        "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
        "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
        "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
        "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
        "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",
        "This allows the proxy to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.",
        "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 313 Object Output Stream Convert ResultSet Object Input Stream Convert ResultSet All Data Recipe ResultSet All Data ResultSet Network Ganesh Proxy Ganesh JDBC Driver Result Set Recipe Result Set Yes Yes No No GaneshInputStream GaneshOutputStream Figure 4: Dataflow for Result Handling 3.4 Encoding and Decoding Results The Ganesh proxy receives database output as Java objects from the native JDBC driver.",
        "It examines this output to see if a Java object of type ResultSet is present.",
        "The JDBC interface uses this data type to store results of database queries.",
        "If a ResultSet object is found, it is shrunk as discussed below.",
        "All other Java objects are passed through unmodified.",
        "As discussed in Section 3.1, the proxy uses the row boundaries defined in the ResultSet to partition it into fragments consisting of single result rows.",
        "All ResultSet objects are converted into objects of a new type called RecipeResultSet.",
        "We use the term recipe for this compact description of a database result because of its similarity to a file recipe in the CASPER file system [37].",
        "The conversion replaces each result fragment that is likely to be present in the Ganesh drivers cache by a SHA-1 hash of that fragment.",
        "Previously unseen result fragments are retained verbatim.",
        "The proxy also retains hashes for the new result fragments as they will be present in the drivers cache in the future.",
        "Note that the proxy only caches hashes for result fragments and does not cache recipes.",
        "The proxy constructs a RecipeResultSet by checking for similarity at the entire result and then the row level.",
        "If the entire result is predicted to be present in the Ganesh drivers cache, the RecipeResultSet is simply a single hash of the entire result.",
        "Otherwise, it contains hashes for those rows predicted to be present in that cache; all other rows are retained verbatim.",
        "If the proxy estimates an overall space savings, it will transmit the RecipeResultSet.",
        "Otherwise the original ResultSet is transmitted.",
        "The RecipeResultSet objects are transformed back into ResultSet objects by the Ganesh driver.",
        "Figure 4 illustrates ResultSet handling at both ends.",
        "Each SHA-1 hash found in a RecipeResultSet is looked up in the local cache of result fragments.",
        "On a hit, the hash is replaced by the corresponding fragment.",
        "On a miss, the driver contacts the Ganesh proxy to fetch the fragment.",
        "All previously unseen result fragments that were retained verbatim by the proxy are hashed and added to the result cache.",
        "There should be very few misses if the proxy has accurately tracked the Ganesh drivers cache state.",
        "A future optimization would be to batch the fetch of missing fragments.",
        "This would be valuable when there are many small missing fragments in a high-latency WAN.",
        "Once the transformation is complete, the fully reconstructed ResultSet object is passed up to the application. 4.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION Three questions follow from the goals and design of Ganesh: • First, can performance can be improved significantly by exploiting similarity across database results?",

        "Our evaluation answers these question through controlled experiments with the Ganesh prototype.",
        "This section describes the benchmarks used, our evaluation procedure, and the experimental setup.",
        "Results of the experiments are presented in Sections 5, 6, and 7. 4.1 Benchmarks Our evaluation is based on two benchmarks [18] that have been widely used by other researchers to evaluate various aspects of multi-tier [27] and eBusiness architectures [9].",
        "The first benchmark, BBOARD, is modeled after Slashdot, a technology-oriented news site.",
        "The second benchmark, AUCTION, is modeled after eBay, an online auction site.",
        "In both benchmarks, most content is dynamically generated from information stored in a database.",
        "Details of the datasets used can be found in Table 1. 4.1.1 The BBOARD Benchmark The BBOARD benchmark, also known as RUBBoS [18], models Slashdot, a popular technology-oriented web site.",
        "Slashdot aggregates links to news stories and other topics of interest found elsewhere on the web.",
        "The site also serves as a bulletin board by allowing users to comment on the posted stories in a threaded conversation form.",
        "It is not uncommon for a story to gather hundreds of comments in a matter of hours.",
        "The BBOARD benchmark is similar to the site and models the activities of a user, including readonly operations such as browsing the stories of the day, browsing story categories, and viewing comments as well as write operations such as new user registration, adding and moderating comments, and story submission.",
        "The benchmark consists of three different phases: a short warmup phase, a runtime phase representing the main body of the workload, and a short cool-down phase.",
        "In this paper we only report results from the runtime phase.",
        "The warm-up phase is important in establishing dynamic system state, but measurements from that phase are not significant for our evaluation.",
        "The cool-down phase is solely for allowing the benchmark to shut down.",
        "The warm-up, runtime, and cool-down phases are 2, 15, and 2 minutes respectively.",
        "The number of simulated clients were 400, 800, 1200, and 1600.",
        "The benchmark is available in a Java Servlets and PHP version and has different datasets; we evaluated Ganesh using the Java Servlets version and the Expanded dataset.",

        "The second, the Browsing mix, contains only read-only operations and does not update the database. 4.2 Experimental Procedure Both benchmarks involve a synthetic workload of clients accessing a web server.",
        "The number of clients emulated is an experimental parameter.",
        "Each emulated client runs an instance of the benchmark in its own thread, using a matrix to transition between different benchmark states.",
        "The matrix defines a stochastic model with probabilities of transitioning between the different states that represent typical user actions.",
        "An example transition is a user logging into the AUCTION system and then deciding on whether to post an item for sale or bid on active auctions.",
        "Each client also models user think time between requests.",
        "The think time is modeled as an exponential distribution with a mean of 7 seconds.",
        "We evaluate Ganesh along two axes: number of clients and WAN bandwidth.",
        "Higher loads are especially useful in understanding Ganeshs performance when the CPU or disk of the database server or proxy is the limiting factor.",
        "A previous study has shown that approximately 50% of the wide-area Internet bottlenecks observed had an available bandwidth under 10 Mb/s [1].",
        "Based on this work, we focus our evaluation on the WAN bandwidth of 5 Mb/s with 66 ms of round-trip latency, representative of severely constrained network paths, and 20 Mb/s with 33 ms of round-trip latency, representative of a moderately constrained network path.",
        "We also report Ganeshs performance at 100 Mb/s with no added round-trip latency.",
        "This bandwidth, representative of an unconstrained network, is especially useful in revealing any potential overhead of Ganesh in situations where WAN bandwidth is not the limiting factor.",
        "For each combination of number of clients and WAN bandwidth, we measured results from the two configurations listed below: • Native: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(a).",
        "Native avoids Ganeshs overhead in using a proxy and performing Java object serialization. • Ganesh: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(b).",
        "For a given number of clients and WAN bandwidth, comparing these results to the corresponding Native results gives the performance benefit due to the Ganesh middleware system.",
        "The metric used to quantify the improvement in throughput is the number of client requests that can be serviced per second.",
        "The metric used to quantify Ganeshs overhead is the average response time for a client request.",
        "For all of the experiments, the Ganesh driver used by the application server used a cache size of 100,000 items1 .",
        "The proxy was effective in tracking the Ganesh drivers cache state; for all of our experiments the miss rate on the driver never exceeded 0.7%. 4.3 Experimental Setup The experimental setup used for the benchmarks can be seen in Figure 5.",
        "All machines were 3.2 GHz Pentium 4s (with HyperThreading enabled.)",
        "With the exception of the database server, all machines had 2 GB of SDRAM and ran the Fedora Core Linux distribution.",
        "The database server had 4 GB of SDRAM.",
        "We used Apaches Tomcat as both the application server that hosted the Java Servlets and the web server.",
        "Both benchmarks used Java Servlets to generate the dynamic content.",
        "The database server used the open source MySQL database.",
        "For the native JDBC drivers, we used the Connector/J drivers provided by MySQL.",
        "The application server used Suns Java Virtual Machine as the runtime environment for the Java Servlets.",
        "The sysstat tool was used to monitor the CPU, network, disk, and memory utilization on all machines.",
        "The machines were connected by a switched gigabit Ethernet network.",
        "As shown in Figure 5, the front-end web and application server was separated from the proxy and database server by a NetEm router [16].",
        "This router allowed us to control the bandwidth and latency settings on the network.",
        "The NetEm router is a standard PC with two network cards running the Linux Traffic Control and Network Emulation software.",
        "The bandwidth and latency constraints were only applied to the link between the application server and the database for the native case and between the application server and the proxy for the Ganesh case.",
        "There is no communication between the application server and the database with Ganesh as all data flows through the proxy.",
        "As our focus was on the WAN link between the application server and the database, there were no constraints on the link between the simulated test clients and the web server. 5.",

        "To answer this question, we used microbenchmarks and the BBOARD and AUCTION benchmarks.",
        "As Ganesh always performed better than Rabin fingerprinting, we only present a subset of the results here in the interests of brevity. 6.1 Microbenchmarks Two microbenchmarks show an example of the effects of data reordering on Rabin fingerprinting algorithm.",
        "In the first microbenchmark, SelectSort1, a query with a specified sort order selects 223.6 MB of data spread over approximately 280 K rows.",
        "The query is then repeated with a different sort attribute.",
        "While the same number of rows and the same data is returned, the order of rows is different.",
        "In such a scenario, one would expect a large amount of similarity to be detected between both results.",
        "As Table 2 shows, Ganeshs row-based algorithm achieves a 97.6% reduction while the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm, with the average chunk size parameter set to 4 KB, only achieves a 1% reduction.",
        "The reason, as shown earlier in Figure 2, is that with Rabin fingerprinting, the spans of data between two consecutive boundaries usually cross row boundaries.",
        "With the order of the rows changing in the second result and the Rabin fingerprints now spanning different rows, the algorithm is unable to detect significant similarity.",
        "The small gain seen is mostly for those single rows that are large enough to be broken into multiple chunks.",
        "SelectSort2, another micro-benchmark executed the same queries but increased the minimum chunk size of the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm.",
        "As can be seen in Table 2, even the small gain from the previous microbenchmark disappears as the minimum chunk size was greater than the average row size.",

        "As Figure 9 (a) shows, at 5 Mb/s, independent of the test client configuration, Rabin significantly underperforms Ganesh.",
        "This happens because of a combination of two reasons.",
        "First, as outlined in Section 3.1, Rabin finds less similarity as it does not exploit the results structural information.",
        "Second, this benchmark contained some queries that generated large results.",
        "In this case, Rabin, with a small average chunk size, generated a large number of objects that evicted other useful data from the cache.",
        "In contrast, Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly increase the size of the chunks.",
        "This was confirmed as cache statistics showed that Ganeshs hit ratio was roughly three time that of Rabin.",
        "Throughput measurements at 20 Mb/s were similar with the exception of Rabins performance with 400 test clients.",
        "In this case, Ganesh was not network limited and, in fact, the throughput was the same as 400 clients at 5 Mb/s.",
        "Rabin, however, took advantage of the bandwidth increase from 5 to 20 Mb/s to deliver a slightly better performance.",
        "At 100 Mb/s, Rabins throughput was almost similar to Ganesh as bandwidth was no longer a bottleneck.",
        "The normalized response time, presented in Figure 9 (b), shows similar trends.",
        "At 5 and 20 Mb/s, the addition of test clients decreases the normalized response time as Ganeshs average response time increases faster than Rabins.",
        "However, at no point does Rabin outperform Ganesh.",
        "Note that at 400 and 800 clients at 100 Mb/s, Rabin does have a higher overhead even when it is not bandwidth constrained.",
        "As mentioned in Section 3.1, this is due to the fact that Rabin has to hash each ResultSet twice.",
        "The overhead disappears with 1200 and 1600 clients as the database CPU is saturated and limits the performance of both Ganesh and Rabin. 7.",
        "PROXY OVERHEAD In this section, we address the third question raised in Section 4: Is the overhead of Ganeshs proxy-based design acceptable?",
        "To answer this question, we concentrate on its performance at the higher bandwidths.",
        "Our evaluation in Section 5 showed that Ganesh, when compared to Native, can deliver a substantial throughput improvement at lower bandwidths.",
        "It is only at higher bandwidths that latency, measured by the average response time for a client request, and throughput, measured by the number of client requests that can be serviced per second, overheads would be visible.",
        "Looking at the Authoring mix of the original BBOARD benchmark, there are no visible gains from Ganesh at 100 Mb/s.",
        "Ganesh, however, still tracks Native in terms of throughput.",
        "While the average response time is higher for Ganesh, the absolute difference is in between 0.01 and 0.04 seconds and would be imperceptible to the end-user.",
        "The Browsing mix shows an even smaller difference in average response times.",
        "The results from the filter variant of the BBOARD benchmarks are similar.",
        "Even for the AUCTION benchmark, the difference between Native and Ganeshs response time at 100 Mb/s was never greater than 0.02 seconds.",
        "The only exception to the above results was seen in the filter variant of the BBOARD benchmark where Ganesh at 1600 test clients added 0.85 seconds to the average response time.",

        "In this section, we first discuss alternative approaches to caching dynamic content and then examine other uses of hash-based primitives in distributed systems. 8.1 Caching Dynamic Content At the database layer, a number of systems have advocated middletier caching where parts of the database are replicated at the edge or server [3, 4, 20].",
        "These systems either cache entire tables in what is essentially a replicated database or use materialized views from previous query replies [19].",
        "They require tight integration with the back-end database to ensure a time bound on the propagation of updates.",
        "These systems are also usually targeted towards workloads that do not require strict consistency and can tolerate stale data.",
        "Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.",
        "Gao et al. [15] propose using a distributed object replication architecture where the data stores consistency requirements are adapted on a per-application basis.",
        "These solutions require substantial developer resources and detailed understanding of the application being modified.",
        "While systems that attempt to automate the partitioning and replication of an applications database exist [34], they do not provide full transaction semantics.",
        "In comparison, Ganesh does not weaken any of the semantics provided by the underlying database.",
        "Recent work in the evaluation of edge caching options for dynamic web sites [38] has suggested that, without careful planning, employing complex offloading strategies can hurt performance.",
        "Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers except the database should be offloaded to the edge.",
        "Our evaluation of Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios.",
        "To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.",
        "The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are complementary and they would benefit each other.",
        "Moving up to the presentation layer, there has been widespread adoption of fragment-based caching [14], which improves cache utilization by separately caching different parts of generated web pages.",
        "While fragment-based caching works at the edge, a recent proposal has proposed moving web page assembly to the clients to optimize content delivery [31].",
        "While Ganesh is not used at the presentation layer, the same principles have been applied in Duplicate Transfer Detection [25] to increase web cache efficiency as well as for web access across bandwidth limited links [33]. 8.2 Hash-based Systems The past few years have seen the emergence of many systems that exploit hash-based techniques.",
        "At the heart of all these systems is the idea of detecting similarity in data without requiring interpretation of that data.",
        "This simple yet elegant idea relies on cryptographic hashing, as discussed earlier in Section 2.",
        "Successful applications of this idea span a wide range of storage systems.",
        "Examples include peer-to-peer backup of personal computing files [11], storage-efficient archiving of data [29], and finding similar files [21].",
        "Spring and Wetherall [35] apply similar principles at the network level.",
        "Using synchronized caches at both ends of a network link, duplicated data is replaced by smaller tokens for transmission and then restored at the remote end.",
        "This and other hash-based systems such as the CASPER [37] and LBFS [26] filesystems, and Layer-2 bandwidth optimizers such as Riverbed and Peribit use Rabin fingerprinting [30] to discover spans of commonality in data.",
        "This approach is especially useful when data items are modified in-place through insertions, deletions, and updates.",
        "However, as Section 6 shows, the performance of this technique can show a dramatic drop in the presence of data reordering.",
        "Ganesh instead uses row boundaries as dividers for detecting similarity.",
        "The most aggressive use of hash-based techniques is by systems that use hashes as the primary identifiers for objects in persistent storage.",
        "Storage systems such as CFS [12] and PAST [13] that have been built using distributed hash tables fall into this category.",
        "Single Instance Storage [6] and Venti [29] are other examples of such systems.",
        "As discussed in Section 2.2, the use of cryptographic hashes for addressing persistent data represents a deeper level of faith in their collision-resistance than that assumed by Ganesh.",
        "If time reveals shortcomings in the hash algorithm, the effort involved in correcting the flaw is much greater.",
        "In Ganesh, it is merely a matter of replacing the hash algorithm. 9.",
        "CONCLUSION The growing use of dynamic web content generated from relational databases places increased demands on WAN bandwidth.",
        "Traditional caching solutions for bandwidth and latency reduction are often ineffective for such content.",
        "This paper shows that the impact of WAN accesses to databases can be substantially reduced through the Ganesh architecture without any compromise of the databases strict consistency semantics.",
        "The essence of the Ganesh architecture is the use of computation at the edges to reduce communication through the Internet.",
        "Ganesh is able to use cryptographic hashes to detect similarity with previous results and send WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 319 compact recipes of results rather than full results.",
        "Our design uses interposition to achieve complete transparency: clients, application servers, and database servers are all unaware of Ganeshs presence and require no modification.",
        "Our experimental evaluation confirms that Ganesh, while conceptually simple, can be highly effective in improving throughput and response time.",
        "Our results also confirm that exploiting the structure present in database results to detect similarity is crucial to this performance improvement. 10.",

                "Even when database content remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors.",
                "In a multitiered architecture, each web request can stress the WAN link between the web server and the database.",
                "This causes user experience to be highly variable because there is no caching to insulate the client from bursty loads.",
                "Previous attempts in caching dynamic database content have generally weakened transactional semantics [3, 4] or required application modifications [15, 34].",
                "We report on a new solution that takes the form of a databaseagnostic middleware layer called Ganesh.",
                "Ganesh makes no effort to semantically interpret the contents of queries or their results.",
                "Instead, it relies exclusively on cryptographic hashing to detect similarities with previous results.",
                "Hash-based similarity detection has seen increasing use in distributed file systems [26, 36, 37] for improving performance on low-bandwidth networks.",
                "However, these techniques have not been used for relational databases.",
                "Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of <br>relational database</br> results to yield superior performance improvement.",
                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",
                "Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.",
                "Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available.",
                "This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code.",
                "Our experiments show that Ganesh, while conceptually simple, can improve performance significantly at bandwidths representative of todays commercial Internet.",

                "For workloads that were not data-intensive, throughput improvements of up to twofold were observed.",
                "Even when bandwidth was not a constraint, Ganesh had low overhead and did not hurt performance.",

                "It can also increase the availability and scalability of web services.",
                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a <br>relational database</br> where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",

                "Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.",
                "Gao et al. [15] propose using a distributed object replication architecture where the data stores consistency requirements are adapted on a per-application basis.",
                "These solutions require substantial developer resources and detailed understanding of the application being modified.",
                "While systems that attempt to automate the partitioning and replication of an applications database exist [34], they do not provide full transaction semantics.",
                "In comparison, Ganesh does not weaken any of the semantics provided by the underlying database.",
                "Recent work in the evaluation of edge caching options for dynamic web sites [38] has suggested that, without careful planning, employing complex offloading strategies can hurt performance.",
                "Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers except the database should be offloaded to the edge.",
                "Our evaluation of Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios.",
                "To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.",
                "The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are complementary and they would benefit each other.",

                "This and other hash-based systems such as the CASPER [37] and LBFS [26] filesystems, and Layer-2 bandwidth optimizers such as Riverbed and Peribit use Rabin fingerprinting [30] to discover spans of commonality in data.",
                "This approach is especially useful when data items are modified in-place through insertions, deletions, and updates.",
                "However, as Section 6 shows, the performance of this technique can show a dramatic drop in the presence of data reordering.",
                "Ganesh instead uses row boundaries as dividers for detecting similarity.",

                "Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement.",
                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",
                "Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.",
                "Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available.",

                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",
                "This allows the proxy to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.",

                "The first benchmark, BBOARD, is modeled after Slashdot, a technology-oriented news site.",
                "The second benchmark, AUCTION, is modeled after eBay, an online auction site.",

                "The benchmark consists of three different phases: a short warmup phase, a runtime phase representing the main body of the workload, and a short cool-down phase.",
                "In this paper we only report results from the runtime phase.",

                "The cool-down phase is solely for allowing the benchmark to shut down.",
                "The warm-up, runtime, and cool-down phases are 2, 15, and 2 minutes respectively.",
                "The number of simulated clients were 400, 800, 1200, and 1600.",

                "The number of clients emulated is an experimental parameter.",
                "Each emulated client runs an instance of the benchmark in its own thread, using a matrix to transition between different benchmark states.",
                "The matrix defines a stochastic model with probabilities of transitioning between the different states that represent typical user actions.",
                "An example transition is a user logging into the AUCTION system and then deciding on whether to post an item for sale or bid on active auctions.",
                "Each client also models user think time between requests.",
                "The think time is modeled as an exponential distribution with a mean of 7 seconds.",
                "We evaluate Ganesh along two axes: number of clients and WAN bandwidth.",
                "Higher loads are especially useful in understanding Ganeshs performance when the CPU or disk of the database server or proxy is the limiting factor.",
                "A previous study has shown that approximately 50% of the wide-area Internet bottlenecks observed had an available bandwidth under 10 Mb/s [1].",
                "Based on this work, we focus our evaluation on the WAN bandwidth of 5 Mb/s with 66 ms of round-trip latency, representative of severely constrained network paths, and 20 Mb/s with 33 ms of round-trip latency, representative of a moderately constrained network path.",
                "We also report Ganeshs performance at 100 Mb/s with no added round-trip latency.",
                "This bandwidth, representative of an unconstrained network, is especially useful in revealing any potential overhead of Ganesh in situations where WAN bandwidth is not the limiting factor.",
                "For each combination of number of clients and WAN bandwidth, we measured results from the two configurations listed below: • Native: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(a).",
                "Native avoids Ganeshs overhead in using a proxy and performing Java object serialization. • Ganesh: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(b).",
                "For a given number of clients and WAN bandwidth, comparing these results to the corresponding Native results gives the performance benefit due to the Ganesh middleware system.",
                "The metric used to quantify the improvement in throughput is the number of client requests that can be serviced per second.",
                "The metric used to quantify Ganeshs overhead is the average response time for a client request.",
                "For all of the experiments, the Ganesh driver used by the application server used a cache size of 100,000 items1 .",
                "The proxy was effective in tracking the Ganesh drivers cache state; for all of our experiments the miss rate on the driver never exceeded 0.7%. 4.3 Experimental Setup The experimental setup used for the benchmarks can be seen in Figure 5.",
                "All machines were 3.2 GHz Pentium 4s (with HyperThreading enabled.)",
                "With the exception of the database server, all machines had 2 GB of SDRAM and ran the Fedora Core Linux distribution.",
                "The database server had 4 GB of SDRAM.",
                "We used Apaches Tomcat as both the application server that hosted the Java Servlets and the web server.",
                "Both benchmarks used Java Servlets to generate the dynamic content.",
                "The database server used the open source MySQL database.",
                "For the native JDBC drivers, we used the Connector/J drivers provided by MySQL.",
                "The application server used Suns Java Virtual Machine as the runtime environment for the Java Servlets.",
                "The sysstat tool was used to monitor the CPU, network, disk, and memory utilization on all machines.",
                "The machines were connected by a switched gigabit Ethernet network.",
                "As shown in Figure 5, the front-end web and application server was separated from the proxy and database server by a NetEm router [16].",
                "This router allowed us to control the bandwidth and latency settings on the network.",
                "The NetEm router is a standard PC with two network cards running the Linux Traffic Control and Network Emulation software.",
                "The bandwidth and latency constraints were only applied to the link between the application server and the database for the native case and between the application server and the proxy for the Ganesh case.",
                "There is no communication between the application server and the database with Ganesh as all data flows through the proxy.",
                "As our focus was on the WAN link between the application server and the database, there were no constraints on the link between the simulated test clients and the web server. 5.",
                "THROUGHPUT AND RESPONSE TIME In this section, we address the first question raised in Section 4: Can performance can be improved significantly by exploiting similarity across database results?",
                "To answer this question, we use results from the BBOARD and AUCTION benchmarks.",
                "We use two metrics to quantify the performance improvement obtainable through the use of Ganesh: throughput, from the perspective of the web server, and average response time, from the perspective of the client.",

                "Natives throughput drops with an increase in test clients as clients timeout due to congestion at the application server.",
                "Usability studies have shown that response times above 10 seconds cause the user to move on to 1 As Java lacks a sizeof() operator, Java caches therefore limit their size based on the number of objects.",
                "The size of cache dumps taken at the end of the experiments never exceeded 212 MB.",

                "This happens because of a combination of two reasons.",
                "First, as outlined in Section 3.1, Rabin finds less similarity as it does not exploit the results structural information.",
                "Second, this benchmark contained some queries that generated large results.",
                "In this case, Rabin, with a small average chunk size, generated a large number of objects that evicted other useful data from the cache.",
                "In contrast, Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly increase the size of the chunks.",
                "This was confirmed as cache statistics showed that Ganeshs hit ratio was roughly three time that of Rabin.",

                "In this case, Ganesh was not network limited and, in fact, the throughput was the same as 400 clients at 5 Mb/s.",

                "As mentioned in Section 3.1, this is due to the fact that Rabin has to hash each ResultSet twice.",
                "The overhead disappears with 1200 and 1600 clients as the database CPU is saturated and limits the performance of both Ganesh and Rabin. 7.",
                "PROXY OVERHEAD In this section, we address the third question raised in Section 4: Is the overhead of Ganeshs proxy-based design acceptable?",
                "To answer this question, we concentrate on its performance at the higher bandwidths.",

                "While the average response time is higher for Ganesh, the absolute difference is in between 0.01 and 0.04 seconds and would be imperceptible to the end-user.",

                "These systems either cache entire tables in what is essentially a replicated database or use materialized views from previous query replies [19].",
                "They require tight integration with the back-end database to ensure a time bound on the propagation of updates.",
                "These systems are also usually targeted towards workloads that do not require strict consistency and can tolerate stale data.",
                "Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.",
                "Gao et al. [15] propose using a distributed object replication architecture where the data stores consistency requirements are adapted on a per-application basis.",
                "These solutions require substantial developer resources and detailed understanding of the application being modified.",
                "While systems that attempt to automate the partitioning and replication of an applications database exist [34], they do not provide full transaction semantics.",
                "In comparison, Ganesh does not weaken any of the semantics provided by the underlying database.",
                "Recent work in the evaluation of edge caching options for dynamic web sites [38] has suggested that, without careful planning, employing complex offloading strategies can hurt performance.",
                "Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers except the database should be offloaded to the edge.",
                "Our evaluation of Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios.",
                "To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.",
                "The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are complementary and they would benefit each other.",
                "Moving up to the presentation layer, there has been widespread adoption of fragment-based caching [14], which improves cache utilization by separately caching different parts of generated web pages.",
                "While fragment-based caching works at the edge, a recent proposal has proposed moving web page assembly to the clients to optimize content delivery [31].",
                "While Ganesh is not used at the presentation layer, the same principles have been applied in Duplicate Transfer Detection [25] to increase web cache efficiency as well as for web access across bandwidth limited links [33]. 8.2 Hash-based Systems The past few years have seen the emergence of many systems that exploit hash-based techniques.",
                "At the heart of all these systems is the idea of detecting similarity in data without requiring interpretation of that data.",
                "This simple yet elegant idea relies on cryptographic hashing, as discussed earlier in Section 2.",

                "Using synchronized caches at both ends of a network link, duplicated data is replaced by smaller tokens for transmission and then restored at the remote end.",
                "This and other hash-based systems such as the CASPER [37] and LBFS [26] filesystems, and Layer-2 bandwidth optimizers such as Riverbed and Peribit use Rabin fingerprinting [30] to discover spans of commonality in data.",
                "This approach is especially useful when data items are modified in-place through insertions, deletions, and updates.",
                "However, as Section 6 shows, the performance of this technique can show a dramatic drop in the presence of data reordering.",
                "Ganesh instead uses row boundaries as dividers for detecting similarity.",
                "The most aggressive use of hash-based techniques is by systems that use hashes as the primary identifiers for objects in persistent storage.",
                "Storage systems such as CFS [12] and PAST [13] that have been built using distributed hash tables fall into this category.",
                "Single Instance Storage [6] and Venti [29] are other examples of such systems.",
                "As discussed in Section 2.2, the use of cryptographic hashes for addressing persistent data represents a deeper level of faith in their collision-resistance than that assumed by Ganesh.",
                "If time reveals shortcomings in the hash algorithm, the effort involved in correcting the flaw is much greater.",
                "In Ganesh, it is merely a matter of replacing the hash algorithm. 9.",

                "Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement.",
                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",
                "Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.",
                "Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available.",
                "This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code.",

                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",
                "This allows the proxy to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.",

                "On a miss, the driver contacts the Ganesh proxy to fetch the fragment.",
                "All previously unseen result fragments that were retained verbatim by the proxy are hashed and added to the result cache.",

                "Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers except the database should be offloaded to the edge.",
                "Our evaluation of Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios.",
                "To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.",
                "The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are complementary and they would benefit each other.",

                "However, as Section 6 shows, the performance of this technique can show a dramatic drop in the presence of data reordering.",
                "Ganesh instead uses row boundaries as dividers for detecting similarity.",

                "As discussed in Section 2.2, the use of cryptographic hashes for addressing persistent data represents a deeper level of faith in their collision-resistance than that assumed by Ganesh.",
                "If time reveals shortcomings in the hash algorithm, the effort involved in correcting the flaw is much greater.",

                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",
                "This allows the proxy to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.",

                "We use the term recipe for this compact description of a database result because of its similarity to a file recipe in the CASPER file system [37].",

                "Note that the proxy only caches hashes for result fragments and does not cache recipes.",
                "The proxy constructs a RecipeResultSet by checking for similarity at the entire result and then the row level.",
                "If the entire result is predicted to be present in the Ganesh drivers cache, the RecipeResultSet is simply a single hash of the entire result.",
                "Otherwise, it contains hashes for those rows predicted to be present in that cache; all other rows are retained verbatim.",
                "If the proxy estimates an overall space savings, it will transmit the RecipeResultSet.",
                "Otherwise the original ResultSet is transmitted.",

                "Each SHA-1 hash found in a RecipeResultSet is looked up in the local cache of result fragments.",
                "On a hit, the hash is replaced by the corresponding fragment.",
                "On a miss, the driver contacts the Ganesh proxy to fetch the fragment.",
                "All previously unseen result fragments that were retained verbatim by the proxy are hashed and added to the result cache.",
                "There should be very few misses if the proxy has accurately tracked the Ganesh drivers cache state.",
                "A future optimization would be to batch the fetch of missing fragments.",

                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",

                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",

                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",

                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",

                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",

                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",

                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",

                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits <br>redundancy</br> in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "<br>redundancy</br> can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects <br>redundancy</br>, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",

                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",

                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",
                "This allows the proxy to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.",

                "If the proxy estimates an overall space savings, it will transmit the RecipeResultSet.",

                "Figure 4 illustrates ResultSet handling at both ends.",
                "Each SHA-1 hash found in a RecipeResultSet is looked up in the local cache of result fragments.",
                "On a hit, the hash is replaced by the corresponding fragment.",
                "On a miss, the driver contacts the Ganesh proxy to fetch the fragment.",
                "All previously unseen result fragments that were retained verbatim by the proxy are hashed and added to the result cache.",
                "There should be very few misses if the proxy has accurately tracked the Ganesh drivers cache state.",
                "A future optimization would be to batch the fetch of missing fragments.",

                "Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement.",
                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",
                "Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.",
                "Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available.",

                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a <br>natural chunk boundary</br>.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",

                "Even when database content remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors.",
                "In a multitiered architecture, each web request can stress the WAN link between the web server and the database.",
                "This causes user experience to be highly variable because there is no caching to insulate the client from bursty loads.",
                "Previous attempts in caching dynamic database content have generally weakened transactional semantics [3, 4] or required application modifications [15, 34].",
                "We report on a new solution that takes the form of a databaseagnostic middleware layer called Ganesh.",
                "Ganesh makes no effort to semantically interpret the contents of queries or their results.",
                "Instead, it relies exclusively on cryptographic hashing to detect similarities with previous results.",
                "Hash-based similarity detection has seen increasing use in distributed file systems [26, 36, 37] for improving performance on low-bandwidth networks.",
                "However, these techniques have not been used for relational databases.",
                "Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement.",
                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",
                "Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.",
                "Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available.",
                "This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code.",

                "It can also increase the availability and scalability of web services.",
                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs <br>proxy</br>-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh <br>proxy</br>.",
                "This <br>proxy</br>, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a <br>proxy</br> at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 <br>proxy</br>-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh <br>proxy</br> Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the <br>proxy</br>.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or <br>proxy</br> to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the <br>proxy</br> - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh <br>proxy</br> accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the <br>proxy</br>.",
                "The <br>proxy</br> does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the <br>proxy</br> is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the <br>proxy</br> must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the <br>proxy</br> during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the <br>proxy</br> loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the <br>proxy</br> simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the <br>proxy</br>, it can ask the <br>proxy</br> to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the <br>proxy</br> does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",
                "This allows the <br>proxy</br> to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.",

                "This happens because of a combination of two reasons.",
                "First, as outlined in Section 3.1, Rabin finds less similarity as it does not exploit the results structural information.",

                "These systems are also usually targeted towards workloads that do not require strict consistency and can tolerate stale data.",
                "Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.",
                "Gao et al. [15] propose using a distributed object replication architecture where the data stores consistency requirements are adapted on a per-application basis.",
                "These solutions require substantial developer resources and detailed understanding of the application being modified.",
                "While systems that attempt to automate the partitioning and replication of an applications database exist [34], they do not provide full transaction semantics.",
                "In comparison, Ganesh does not weaken any of the semantics provided by the underlying database.",
                "Recent work in the evaluation of edge caching options for dynamic web sites [38] has suggested that, without careful planning, employing complex offloading strategies can hurt performance.",
                "Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers except the database should be offloaded to the edge.",
                "Our evaluation of Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios.",
                "To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.",
                "The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are complementary and they would benefit each other.",
                "Moving up to the presentation layer, there has been widespread adoption of fragment-based caching [14], which improves cache utilization by separately caching different parts of generated web pages.",
                "While fragment-based caching works at the edge, a recent proposal has proposed moving web page assembly to the clients to optimize content delivery [31].",
                "While Ganesh is not used at the presentation layer, the same principles have been applied in Duplicate Transfer Detection [25] to increase web cache efficiency as well as for web access across bandwidth limited links [33]. 8.2 Hash-based Systems The past few years have seen the emergence of many systems that exploit hash-based techniques.",
                "At the heart of all these systems is the idea of detecting similarity in data without requiring interpretation of that data.",

                "This and other hash-based systems such as the CASPER [37] and LBFS [26] filesystems, and Layer-2 bandwidth optimizers such as Riverbed and Peribit use Rabin fingerprinting [30] to discover spans of commonality in data.",
                "This approach is especially useful when data items are modified in-place through insertions, deletions, and updates.",
                "However, as Section 6 shows, the performance of this technique can show a dramatic drop in the presence of data reordering.",
                "Ganesh instead uses row boundaries as dividers for detecting similarity.",
                "The most aggressive use of hash-based techniques is by systems that use hashes as the primary identifiers for objects in persistent storage.",

                "As discussed in Section 2.2, the use of cryptographic hashes for addressing persistent data represents a deeper level of faith in their collision-resistance than that assumed by Ganesh.",
                "If time reveals shortcomings in the hash algorithm, the effort involved in correcting the flaw is much greater.",
                "In Ganesh, it is merely a matter of replacing the hash algorithm. 9.",

                "Even when database content remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors.",
                "In a multitiered architecture, each web request can stress the WAN link between the web server and the database.",
                "This causes user experience to be highly variable because there is no caching to insulate the client from bursty loads.",
                "Previous attempts in caching dynamic database content have generally weakened transactional semantics [3, 4] or required application modifications [15, 34].",

                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",
                "Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.",
                "Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available.",
                "This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code.",

                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",

                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",

                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one <br>jdbc driver</br> for another without application modifications.",
                "The <br>jdbc driver</br> thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native <br>jdbc driver</br> is replaced with a Ganesh <br>jdbc driver</br> that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native <br>jdbc driver</br> that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",

                "The Ganesh <br>jdbc driver</br> shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native <br>jdbc driver</br>, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",

                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",

                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",

                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",

                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",

                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",

                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",

                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",

                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",

                "To answer this question, we used microbenchmarks and the BBOARD and AUCTION benchmarks.",
                "As Ganesh always performed better than Rabin fingerprinting, we only present a subset of the results here in the interests of brevity. 6.1 Microbenchmarks Two microbenchmarks show an example of the effects of data reordering on Rabin fingerprinting algorithm.",
                "In the first microbenchmark, SelectSort1, a query with a specified sort order selects 223.6 MB of data spread over approximately 280 K rows.",
                "The query is then repeated with a different sort attribute.",
                "While the same number of rows and the same data is returned, the order of rows is different.",
                "In such a scenario, one would expect a large amount of similarity to be detected between both results.",
                "As Table 2 shows, Ganeshs row-based algorithm achieves a 97.6% reduction while the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm, with the average chunk size parameter set to 4 KB, only achieves a 1% reduction.",
                "The reason, as shown earlier in Figure 2, is that with Rabin fingerprinting, the spans of data between two consecutive boundaries usually cross row boundaries.",
                "With the order of the rows changing in the second result and the Rabin fingerprints now spanning different rows, the algorithm is unable to detect significant similarity.",
                "The small gain seen is mostly for those single rows that are large enough to be broken into multiple chunks.",
                "SelectSort2, another micro-benchmark executed the same queries but increased the minimum chunk size of the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm.",
                "As can be seen in Table 2, even the small gain from the previous microbenchmark disappears as the minimum chunk size was greater than the average row size.",
                "While one can partially address these problems by dynamically varying the parameters of the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm, this can be computationally expensive, especially in the presence of changing workloads. 6.2 Application Benchmarks We ran the <br>bboard benchmark</br> described in Section 4.1.1 on two versions of Ganesh: the first with Rabin fingerprinting used as WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 317 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 Mb/s 20 Mb/s 100 Mb/s Test Clients Requests/sec Native Ganesh 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 Mb/s 20 Mb/s 100 Mb/s Test Clients Avg.Resp.Time(sec) Native Ganesh Note Logscale (a) Throughput: Bidding Mix (b) Response Time: Bidding Mix 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 Mb/s 20 Mb/s 100 Mb/s Test Clients Requests/sec Native Ganesh 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 400 800 1200 1600 5 Mb/s 20 Mb/s 100 Mb/s Test Clients Avg.Resp.Time(sec) Native Ganesh Note Logscale (c) Throughput: Browsing Mix (d) Response Time: Browsing Mix Mean of three trials.",

                "As Figure 9 (a) shows, at 5 Mb/s, independent of the test client configuration, Rabin significantly underperforms Ganesh.",
                "This happens because of a combination of two reasons.",
                "First, as outlined in Section 3.1, Rabin finds less similarity as it does not exploit the results structural information.",
                "Second, this benchmark contained some queries that generated large results.",
                "In this case, Rabin, with a small average chunk size, generated a large number of objects that evicted other useful data from the cache.",
                "In contrast, Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly increase the size of the chunks.",
                "This was confirmed as cache statistics showed that Ganeshs hit ratio was roughly three time that of Rabin.",
                "Throughput measurements at 20 Mb/s were similar with the exception of Rabins performance with 400 test clients.",
                "In this case, Ganesh was not network limited and, in fact, the throughput was the same as 400 clients at 5 Mb/s.",
                "Rabin, however, took advantage of the bandwidth increase from 5 to 20 Mb/s to deliver a slightly better performance.",
                "At 100 Mb/s, Rabins throughput was almost similar to Ganesh as bandwidth was no longer a bottleneck.",
                "The normalized response time, presented in Figure 9 (b), shows similar trends.",
                "At 5 and 20 Mb/s, the addition of test clients decreases the normalized response time as Ganeshs average response time increases faster than Rabins.",
                "However, at no point does Rabin outperform Ganesh.",
                "Note that at 400 and 800 clients at 100 Mb/s, Rabin does have a higher overhead even when it is not bandwidth constrained.",
                "As mentioned in Section 3.1, this is due to the fact that Rabin has to hash each ResultSet twice.",
                "The overhead disappears with 1200 and 1600 clients as the database CPU is saturated and limits the performance of both Ganesh and Rabin. 7.",
                "PROXY OVERHEAD In this section, we address the third question raised in Section 4: Is the overhead of Ganeshs proxy-based design acceptable?",
                "To answer this question, we concentrate on its performance at the higher bandwidths.",
                "Our evaluation in Section 5 showed that Ganesh, when compared to Native, can deliver a substantial throughput improvement at lower bandwidths.",
                "It is only at higher bandwidths that latency, measured by the average response time for a client request, and throughput, measured by the number of client requests that can be serviced per second, overheads would be visible.",
                "Looking at the Authoring mix of the original <br>bboard benchmark</br>, there are no visible gains from Ganesh at 100 Mb/s.",
                "Ganesh, however, still tracks Native in terms of throughput.",
                "While the average response time is higher for Ganesh, the absolute difference is in between 0.01 and 0.04 seconds and would be imperceptible to the end-user.",
                "The Browsing mix shows an even smaller difference in average response times.",
                "The results from the filter variant of the BBOARD benchmarks are similar.",
                "Even for the AUCTION benchmark, the difference between Native and Ganeshs response time at 100 Mb/s was never greater than 0.02 seconds.",
                "The only exception to the above results was seen in the filter variant of the <br>bboard benchmark</br> where Ganesh at 1600 test clients added 0.85 seconds to the average response time.",
                "Thus, even for much faster networks where the WAN link is not the bottleneck, Ganesh always delivers throughput equivalent to Native.",

                "In this section, we first discuss alternative approaches to caching dynamic content and then examine other uses of hash-based primitives in distributed systems. 8.1 Caching Dynamic Content At the database layer, a number of systems have advocated middletier caching where parts of the database are replicated at the edge or server [3, 4, 20].",
                "These systems either cache entire tables in what is essentially a replicated database or use materialized views from previous query replies [19].",
                "They require tight integration with the back-end database to ensure a time bound on the propagation of updates.",
                "These systems are also usually targeted towards workloads that do not require strict consistency and can tolerate stale data.",
                "Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.",
                "Gao et al. [15] propose using a distributed object replication architecture where the data stores consistency requirements are adapted on a per-application basis.",
                "These solutions require substantial developer resources and detailed understanding of the application being modified.",
                "While systems that attempt to automate the partitioning and replication of an applications database exist [34], they do not provide full transaction semantics.",
                "In comparison, Ganesh does not weaken any of the semantics provided by the underlying database.",
                "Recent work in the evaluation of edge caching options for dynamic web sites [38] has suggested that, without careful planning, employing complex offloading strategies can hurt performance.",
                "Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers except the database should be offloaded to the edge.",
                "Our evaluation of Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios.",
                "To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.",
                "The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are complementary and they would benefit each other.",
                "Moving up to the presentation layer, there has been widespread adoption of fragment-based caching [14], which improves cache utilization by separately caching different parts of generated web pages.",
                "While fragment-based caching works at the edge, a recent proposal has proposed moving web page assembly to the clients to optimize content delivery [31].",
                "While Ganesh is not used at the presentation layer, the same principles have been applied in Duplicate Transfer Detection [25] to increase web cache efficiency as well as for web access across bandwidth limited links [33]. 8.2 Hash-based Systems The past few years have seen the emergence of many systems that exploit hash-based techniques.",
                "At the heart of all these systems is the idea of detecting similarity in data without requiring interpretation of that data.",
                "This simple yet elegant idea relies on cryptographic hashing, as discussed earlier in Section 2.",

                "Spring and Wetherall [35] apply similar principles at the network level.",
                "Using synchronized caches at both ends of a network link, duplicated data is replaced by smaller tokens for transmission and then restored at the remote end.",
                "This and other hash-based systems such as the CASPER [37] and LBFS [26] filesystems, and Layer-2 bandwidth optimizers such as Riverbed and Peribit use Rabin fingerprinting [30] to discover spans of commonality in data.",
                "This approach is especially useful when data items are modified in-place through insertions, deletions, and updates.",
                "However, as Section 6 shows, the performance of this technique can show a dramatic drop in the presence of data reordering.",
                "Ganesh instead uses row boundaries as dividers for detecting similarity.",
                "The most aggressive use of hash-based techniques is by systems that use hashes as the primary identifiers for objects in persistent storage.",
                "Storage systems such as CFS [12] and PAST [13] that have been built using distributed hash tables fall into this category.",
                "Single Instance Storage [6] and Venti [29] are other examples of such systems.",
                "As discussed in Section 2.2, the use of cryptographic hashes for addressing persistent data represents a deeper level of faith in their collision-resistance than that assumed by Ganesh.",
                "If time reveals shortcomings in the hash algorithm, the effort involved in correcting the flaw is much greater.",
                "In Ganesh, it is merely a matter of replacing the hash algorithm. 9.",
                "CONCLUSION The growing use of dynamic web content generated from relational databases places increased demands on WAN bandwidth.",
                "Traditional caching solutions for bandwidth and latency reduction are often ineffective for such content.",
                "This paper shows that the impact of WAN accesses to databases can be substantially reduced through the Ganesh architecture without any compromise of the databases strict consistency semantics.",

                "Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement.",
                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",

                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",

                "To answer this question, we used microbenchmarks and the BBOARD and AUCTION benchmarks.",
                "As Ganesh always performed better than Rabin fingerprinting, we only present a subset of the results here in the interests of brevity. 6.1 Microbenchmarks Two microbenchmarks show an example of the effects of data reordering on Rabin fingerprinting algorithm.",
                "In the first microbenchmark, SelectSort1, a query with a specified sort order selects 223.6 MB of data spread over approximately 280 K rows.",
                "The query is then repeated with a different sort attribute.",
                "While the same number of rows and the same data is returned, the order of rows is different.",
                "In such a scenario, one would expect a large amount of similarity to be detected between both results.",
                "As Table 2 shows, Ganeshs row-based algorithm achieves a 97.6% reduction while the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm, with the average chunk size parameter set to 4 KB, only achieves a 1% reduction.",
                "The reason, as shown earlier in Figure 2, is that with Rabin fingerprinting, the spans of data between two consecutive boundaries usually cross row boundaries.",
                "With the order of the rows changing in the second result and the Rabin fingerprints now spanning different rows, the algorithm is unable to detect significant similarity.",
                "The small gain seen is mostly for those single rows that are large enough to be broken into multiple chunks.",
                "SelectSort2, another micro-benchmark executed the same queries but increased the minimum chunk size of the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm.",
                "As can be seen in Table 2, even the small gain from the previous microbenchmark disappears as the minimum chunk size was greater than the average row size.",

                "As Figure 9 (a) shows, at 5 Mb/s, independent of the test client configuration, Rabin significantly underperforms Ganesh.",
                "This happens because of a combination of two reasons.",
                "First, as outlined in Section 3.1, Rabin finds less similarity as it does not exploit the results structural information.",
                "Second, this benchmark contained some queries that generated large results.",
                "In this case, Rabin, with a small average chunk size, generated a large number of objects that evicted other useful data from the cache.",
                "In contrast, Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly increase the size of the chunks.",
                "This was confirmed as cache statistics showed that Ganeshs hit ratio was roughly three time that of Rabin.",
                "Throughput measurements at 20 Mb/s were similar with the exception of Rabins performance with 400 test clients.",
                "In this case, Ganesh was not network limited and, in fact, the throughput was the same as 400 clients at 5 Mb/s.",
                "Rabin, however, took advantage of the bandwidth increase from 5 to 20 Mb/s to deliver a slightly better performance.",
                "At 100 Mb/s, Rabins throughput was almost similar to Ganesh as bandwidth was no longer a bottleneck.",
                "The normalized response time, presented in Figure 9 (b), shows similar trends.",
                "At 5 and 20 Mb/s, the addition of test clients decreases the normalized response time as Ganeshs average response time increases faster than Rabins.",
                "However, at no point does Rabin outperform Ganesh.",
                "Note that at 400 and 800 clients at 100 Mb/s, Rabin does have a higher overhead even when it is not bandwidth constrained.",
                "As mentioned in Section 3.1, this is due to the fact that Rabin has to hash each ResultSet twice.",
                "The overhead disappears with 1200 and 1600 clients as the database CPU is saturated and limits the performance of both Ganesh and Rabin. 7.",
                "PROXY OVERHEAD In this section, we address the third question raised in Section 4: Is the overhead of Ganeshs proxy-based design acceptable?",
                "To answer this question, we concentrate on its performance at the higher bandwidths.",
                "Our evaluation in Section 5 showed that Ganesh, when compared to Native, can deliver a substantial throughput improvement at lower bandwidths.",
                "It is only at higher bandwidths that latency, measured by the average response time for a client request, and throughput, measured by the number of client requests that can be serviced per second, overheads would be visible.",
                "Looking at the Authoring mix of the original BBOARD benchmark, there are no visible gains from Ganesh at 100 Mb/s.",
                "Ganesh, however, still tracks Native in terms of throughput.",
                "While the average response time is higher for Ganesh, the absolute difference is in between 0.01 and 0.04 seconds and would be imperceptible to the end-user.",
                "The Browsing mix shows an even smaller difference in average response times.",
                "The results from the filter variant of the BBOARD benchmarks are similar.",
                "Even for the AUCTION benchmark, the difference between Native and Ganeshs response time at 100 Mb/s was never greater than 0.02 seconds.",
                "The only exception to the above results was seen in the filter variant of the BBOARD benchmark where Ganesh at 1600 test clients added 0.85 seconds to the average response time.",
                "Thus, even for much faster networks where the WAN link is not the bottleneck, Ganesh always delivers throughput equivalent to Native.",

                "In this section, we first discuss alternative approaches to caching dynamic content and then examine other uses of hash-based primitives in distributed systems. 8.1 Caching Dynamic Content At the database layer, a number of systems have advocated middletier caching where parts of the database are replicated at the edge or server [3, 4, 20].",
                "These systems either cache entire tables in what is essentially a replicated database or use materialized views from previous query replies [19].",
                "They require tight integration with the back-end database to ensure a time bound on the propagation of updates.",
                "These systems are also usually targeted towards workloads that do not require strict consistency and can tolerate stale data.",
                "Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.",
                "Gao et al. [15] propose using a distributed object replication architecture where the data stores consistency requirements are adapted on a per-application basis.",
                "These solutions require substantial developer resources and detailed understanding of the application being modified.",
                "While systems that attempt to automate the partitioning and replication of an applications database exist [34], they do not provide full transaction semantics.",
                "In comparison, Ganesh does not weaken any of the semantics provided by the underlying database.",
                "Recent work in the evaluation of edge caching options for dynamic web sites [38] has suggested that, without careful planning, employing complex offloading strategies can hurt performance.",
                "Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers except the database should be offloaded to the edge.",
                "Our evaluation of Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios.",
                "To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.",
                "The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are complementary and they would benefit each other.",
                "Moving up to the presentation layer, there has been widespread adoption of fragment-based caching [14], which improves cache utilization by separately caching different parts of generated web pages.",
                "While fragment-based caching works at the edge, a recent proposal has proposed moving web page assembly to the clients to optimize content delivery [31].",
                "While Ganesh is not used at the presentation layer, the same principles have been applied in Duplicate Transfer Detection [25] to increase web cache efficiency as well as for web access across bandwidth limited links [33]. 8.2 Hash-based Systems The past few years have seen the emergence of many systems that exploit hash-based techniques.",
                "At the heart of all these systems is the idea of detecting similarity in data without requiring interpretation of that data.",
                "This simple yet elegant idea relies on cryptographic hashing, as discussed earlier in Section 2.",
                "Successful applications of this idea span a wide range of storage systems.",

                "Spring and Wetherall [35] apply similar principles at the network level.",
                "Using synchronized caches at both ends of a network link, duplicated data is replaced by smaller tokens for transmission and then restored at the remote end.",
                "This and other hash-based systems such as the CASPER [37] and LBFS [26] filesystems, and Layer-2 bandwidth optimizers such as Riverbed and Peribit use Rabin fingerprinting [30] to discover spans of commonality in data.",
                "This approach is especially useful when data items are modified in-place through insertions, deletions, and updates.",
                "However, as Section 6 shows, the performance of this technique can show a dramatic drop in the presence of data reordering.",
                "Ganesh instead uses row boundaries as dividers for detecting similarity.",
                "The most aggressive use of hash-based techniques is by systems that use hashes as the primary identifiers for objects in persistent storage.",
                "Storage systems such as CFS [12] and PAST [13] that have been built using distributed hash tables fall into this category.",
                "Single Instance Storage [6] and Venti [29] are other examples of such systems.",
                "As discussed in Section 2.2, the use of cryptographic hashes for addressing persistent data represents a deeper level of faith in their collision-resistance than that assumed by Ganesh.",
                "If time reveals shortcomings in the hash algorithm, the effort involved in correcting the flaw is much greater.",
                "In Ganesh, it is merely a matter of replacing the hash algorithm. 9.",
                "CONCLUSION The growing use of dynamic web content generated from relational databases places increased demands on WAN bandwidth.",
                "Traditional caching solutions for bandwidth and latency reduction are often ineffective for such content.",
                "This paper shows that the impact of WAN accesses to databases can be substantially reduced through the Ganesh architecture without any compromise of the databases strict consistency semantics.",

                "Even when database content remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors.",
                "In a multitiered architecture, each web request can stress the WAN link between the web server and the database.",

                "Ganesh makes no effort to semantically interpret the contents of queries or their results.",

                "Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement.",
                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",
                "Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.",
                "Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available.",
                "This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code.",

                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",
                "This allows the proxy to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.",

                "If the entire result is predicted to be present in the Ganesh drivers cache, the <br>reciperesultset</br> is simply a single hash of the entire result.",

                "In this paper we only report results from the runtime phase.",
                "The warm-up phase is important in establishing dynamic system state, but measurements from that phase are not significant for our evaluation.",
                "The cool-down phase is solely for allowing the benchmark to shut down.",
                "The warm-up, runtime, and cool-down phases are 2, 15, and 2 minutes respectively.",

                "Higher loads are especially useful in understanding Ganeshs performance when the CPU or disk of the database server or proxy is the limiting factor.",
                "A previous study has shown that approximately 50% of the wide-area Internet bottlenecks observed had an available bandwidth under 10 Mb/s [1].",
                "Based on this work, we focus our evaluation on the WAN bandwidth of 5 Mb/s with 66 ms of round-trip latency, representative of severely constrained network paths, and 20 Mb/s with 33 ms of round-trip latency, representative of a moderately constrained network path.",
                "We also report Ganeshs performance at 100 Mb/s with no added round-trip latency.",
                "This bandwidth, representative of an unconstrained network, is especially useful in revealing any potential overhead of Ganesh in situations where WAN bandwidth is not the limiting factor.",
                "For each combination of number of clients and WAN bandwidth, we measured results from the two configurations listed below: • Native: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(a).",
                "Native avoids Ganeshs overhead in using a proxy and performing Java object serialization. • Ganesh: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(b).",
                "For a given number of clients and WAN bandwidth, comparing these results to the corresponding Native results gives the performance benefit due to the Ganesh middleware system.",
                "The metric used to quantify the improvement in throughput is the number of client requests that can be serviced per second.",
                "The metric used to quantify Ganeshs overhead is the average response time for a client request.",
                "For all of the experiments, the Ganesh driver used by the application server used a cache size of 100,000 items1 .",
                "The proxy was effective in tracking the Ganesh drivers cache state; for all of our experiments the miss rate on the driver never exceeded 0.7%. 4.3 Experimental Setup The experimental setup used for the benchmarks can be seen in Figure 5.",

                "The database server had 4 GB of SDRAM.",
                "We used Apaches Tomcat as both the application server that hosted the Java Servlets and the web server.",
                "Both benchmarks used Java Servlets to generate the dynamic content.",
                "The database server used the open source MySQL database.",
                "For the native JDBC drivers, we used the Connector/J drivers provided by MySQL.",
                "The application server used Suns Java Virtual Machine as the runtime environment for the Java Servlets.",
                "The sysstat tool was used to monitor the CPU, network, disk, and memory utilization on all machines.",
                "The machines were connected by a switched gigabit Ethernet network.",
                "As shown in Figure 5, the front-end web and application server was separated from the proxy and database server by a NetEm router [16].",
                "This router allowed us to control the bandwidth and latency settings on the network.",
                "The NetEm router is a standard PC with two network cards running the Linux Traffic Control and Network Emulation software.",
                "The bandwidth and latency constraints were only applied to the link between the application server and the database for the native case and between the application server and the proxy for the Ganesh case.",
                "There is no communication between the application server and the database with Ganesh as all data flows through the proxy.",
                "As our focus was on the WAN link between the application server and the database, there were no constraints on the link between the simulated test clients and the web server. 5.",

                "First, as outlined in Section 3.1, Rabin finds less similarity as it does not exploit the results structural information.",
                "Second, this benchmark contained some queries that generated large results.",
                "In this case, Rabin, with a small average chunk size, generated a large number of objects that evicted other useful data from the cache.",
                "In contrast, Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly increase the size of the chunks.",
                "This was confirmed as cache statistics showed that Ganeshs hit ratio was roughly three time that of Rabin.",
                "Throughput measurements at 20 Mb/s were similar with the exception of Rabins performance with 400 test clients.",
                "In this case, Ganesh was not network limited and, in fact, the throughput was the same as 400 clients at 5 Mb/s.",
                "Rabin, however, took advantage of the bandwidth increase from 5 to 20 Mb/s to deliver a slightly better performance.",
                "At 100 Mb/s, Rabins throughput was almost similar to Ganesh as bandwidth was no longer a bottleneck.",
                "The normalized response time, presented in Figure 9 (b), shows similar trends.",
                "At 5 and 20 Mb/s, the addition of test clients decreases the normalized response time as Ganeshs average response time increases faster than Rabins.",
                "However, at no point does Rabin outperform Ganesh.",
                "Note that at 400 and 800 clients at 100 Mb/s, Rabin does have a higher overhead even when it is not bandwidth constrained.",
                "As mentioned in Section 3.1, this is due to the fact that Rabin has to hash each ResultSet twice.",
                "The overhead disappears with 1200 and 1600 clients as the database CPU is saturated and limits the performance of both Ganesh and Rabin. 7.",
                "PROXY OVERHEAD In this section, we address the third question raised in Section 4: Is the overhead of Ganeshs proxy-based design acceptable?",
                "To answer this question, we concentrate on its performance at the higher bandwidths.",
                "Our evaluation in Section 5 showed that Ganesh, when compared to Native, can deliver a substantial throughput improvement at lower bandwidths.",
                "It is only at higher bandwidths that latency, measured by the average response time for a client request, and throughput, measured by the number of client requests that can be serviced per second, overheads would be visible.",
                "Looking at the Authoring mix of the original BBOARD benchmark, there are no visible gains from Ganesh at 100 Mb/s.",
                "Ganesh, however, still tracks Native in terms of throughput.",
                "While the average response time is higher for Ganesh, the absolute difference is in between 0.01 and 0.04 seconds and would be imperceptible to the end-user.",
                "The Browsing mix shows an even smaller difference in average response times.",
                "The results from the filter variant of the BBOARD benchmarks are similar.",
                "Even for the AUCTION benchmark, the difference between Native and Ganeshs response time at 100 Mb/s was never greater than 0.02 seconds.",
                "The only exception to the above results was seen in the filter variant of the BBOARD benchmark where Ganesh at 1600 test clients added 0.85 seconds to the average response time.",
                "Thus, even for much faster networks where the WAN link is not the bottleneck, Ganesh always delivers throughput equivalent to Native.",
                "While some extra latency is added by the proxy-based design, it is usually imperceptible. 8.",

                "In this section, we first discuss alternative approaches to caching dynamic content and then examine other uses of hash-based primitives in distributed systems. 8.1 Caching Dynamic Content At the database layer, a number of systems have advocated middletier caching where parts of the database are replicated at the edge or server [3, 4, 20].",
                "These systems either cache entire tables in what is essentially a replicated database or use materialized views from previous query replies [19].",
                "They require tight integration with the back-end database to ensure a time bound on the propagation of updates.",
                "These systems are also usually targeted towards workloads that do not require strict consistency and can tolerate stale data.",
                "Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.",
                "Gao et al. [15] propose using a distributed object replication architecture where the data stores consistency requirements are adapted on a per-application basis.",
                "These solutions require substantial developer resources and detailed understanding of the application being modified.",
                "While systems that attempt to automate the partitioning and replication of an applications database exist [34], they do not provide full transaction semantics.",
                "In comparison, Ganesh does not weaken any of the semantics provided by the underlying database.",
                "Recent work in the evaluation of edge caching options for dynamic web sites [38] has suggested that, without careful planning, employing complex offloading strategies can hurt performance.",
                "Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers except the database should be offloaded to the edge.",
                "Our evaluation of Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios.",
                "To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.",
                "The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are complementary and they would benefit each other.",
                "Moving up to the presentation layer, there has been widespread adoption of fragment-based caching [14], which improves cache utilization by separately caching different parts of generated web pages.",
                "While fragment-based caching works at the edge, a recent proposal has proposed moving web page assembly to the clients to optimize content delivery [31].",
                "While Ganesh is not used at the presentation layer, the same principles have been applied in Duplicate Transfer Detection [25] to increase web cache efficiency as well as for web access across bandwidth limited links [33]. 8.2 Hash-based Systems The past few years have seen the emergence of many systems that exploit hash-based techniques.",
                "At the heart of all these systems is the idea of detecting similarity in data without requiring interpretation of that data.",
                "This simple yet elegant idea relies on cryptographic hashing, as discussed earlier in Section 2.",
                "Successful applications of this idea span a wide range of storage systems.",
                "Examples include peer-to-peer backup of personal computing files [11], storage-efficient archiving of data [29], and finding similar files [21].",
                "Spring and Wetherall [35] apply similar principles at the network level.",
                "Using synchronized caches at both ends of a network link, duplicated data is replaced by smaller tokens for transmission and then restored at the remote end.",
                "This and other hash-based systems such as the CASPER [37] and LBFS [26] filesystems, and Layer-2 bandwidth optimizers such as Riverbed and Peribit use Rabin fingerprinting [30] to discover spans of commonality in data.",
                "This approach is especially useful when data items are modified in-place through insertions, deletions, and updates.",
                "However, as Section 6 shows, the performance of this technique can show a dramatic drop in the presence of data reordering.",
                "Ganesh instead uses row boundaries as dividers for detecting similarity.",
                "The most aggressive use of hash-based techniques is by systems that use hashes as the primary identifiers for objects in persistent storage.",
                "Storage systems such as CFS [12] and PAST [13] that have been built using distributed hash tables fall into this category.",
                "Single Instance Storage [6] and Venti [29] are other examples of such systems.",
                "As discussed in Section 2.2, the use of cryptographic hashes for addressing persistent data represents a deeper level of faith in their collision-resistance than that assumed by Ganesh.",
                "If time reveals shortcomings in the hash algorithm, the effort involved in correcting the flaw is much greater.",
                "In Ganesh, it is merely a matter of replacing the hash algorithm. 9.",
                "CONCLUSION The growing use of dynamic web content generated from relational databases places increased demands on WAN bandwidth.",
                "Traditional caching solutions for bandwidth and latency reduction are often ineffective for such content.",

                "This causes user experience to be highly variable because there is no caching to insulate the client from bursty loads.",
                "Previous attempts in caching dynamic database content have generally weakened transactional semantics [3, 4] or required application modifications [15, 34].",

                "Ganesh makes no effort to semantically interpret the contents of queries or their results.",
                "Instead, it relies exclusively on cryptographic hashing to detect similarities with previous results.",
                "Hash-based similarity detection has seen increasing use in distributed file systems [26, 36, 37] for improving performance on low-bandwidth networks.",
                "However, these techniques have not been used for relational databases.",
                "Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement.",
                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",
                "Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.",
                "Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available.",
                "This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code.",
                "Our experiments show that Ganesh, while conceptually simple, can improve performance significantly at bandwidths representative of todays commercial Internet.",
                "On benchmarks modeling multitiered web applications, the throughput improvement was as high as tenfold for data-intensive workloads.",
                "For workloads that were not data-intensive, throughput improvements of up to twofold were observed.",
                "Even when bandwidth was not a constraint, Ganesh had low overhead and did not hurt performance.",
                "Our experiments also confirm that exploiting the structure present in database results is crucial to this performance improvement. 2.",

                "It can also increase the availability and scalability of web services.",
                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",
                "This allows the proxy to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.",

                "On a miss, the driver contacts the Ganesh proxy to fetch the fragment.",

                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",
                "This allows the proxy to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.",

                "All other Java objects are passed through unmodified.",

                "We use the term recipe for this compact description of a database result because of its similarity to a file recipe in the CASPER file system [37].",

                "Note that the proxy only caches hashes for result fragments and does not cache recipes.",
                "The proxy constructs a RecipeResultSet by checking for similarity at the entire result and then the row level.",
                "If the entire result is predicted to be present in the Ganesh drivers cache, the RecipeResultSet is simply a single hash of the entire result.",
                "Otherwise, it contains hashes for those rows predicted to be present in that cache; all other rows are retained verbatim.",
                "If the proxy estimates an overall space savings, it will transmit the RecipeResultSet.",
                "Otherwise the original ResultSet is transmitted.",

                "Figure 4 illustrates ResultSet handling at both ends.",
                "Each SHA-1 hash found in a RecipeResultSet is looked up in the local cache of result fragments.",
                "On a hit, the hash is replaced by the corresponding fragment.",
                "On a miss, the driver contacts the Ganesh proxy to fetch the fragment.",
                "All previously unseen result fragments that were retained verbatim by the proxy are hashed and added to the result cache.",
                "There should be very few misses if the proxy has accurately tracked the Ganesh drivers cache state.",
                "A future optimization would be to batch the fetch of missing fragments.",

                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",

                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",

                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",

                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",

                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",

                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",

                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",

                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",
                "This allows the proxy to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.",

                "If the entire result is predicted to be present in the Ganesh drivers cache, the RecipeResultSet is simply a single hash of the entire result.",
                "Otherwise, it contains hashes for those rows predicted to be present in that cache; all other rows are retained verbatim.",
                "If the proxy estimates an overall space savings, it will transmit the RecipeResultSet.",
                "Otherwise the original ResultSet is transmitted.",

                "Each SHA-1 hash found in a RecipeResultSet is looked up in the local cache of result fragments.",
                "On a hit, the hash is replaced by the corresponding fragment.",
                "On a miss, the driver contacts the Ganesh proxy to fetch the fragment.",
                "All previously unseen result fragments that were retained verbatim by the proxy are hashed and added to the result cache.",
                "There should be very few misses if the proxy has accurately tracked the Ganesh drivers cache state.",

                "Even when database content remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors.",
                "In a multitiered architecture, each web request can stress the WAN link between the web server and the database.",
                "This causes user experience to be highly variable because there is no caching to insulate the client from bursty loads.",
                "Previous attempts in caching dynamic database content have generally weakened transactional semantics [3, 4] or required application modifications [15, 34].",
                "We report on a new solution that takes the form of a databaseagnostic middleware layer called Ganesh.",
                "Ganesh makes no effort to semantically interpret the contents of queries or their results.",
                "Instead, it relies exclusively on cryptographic hashing to detect similarities with previous results.",
                "Hash-based similarity detection has seen increasing use in distributed file systems [26, 36, 37] for improving performance on low-bandwidth networks.",
                "However, these techniques have not been used for relational databases.",
                "Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement.",
                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",
                "Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.",
                "Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available.",
                "This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code.",

                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",

                "Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.",
                "Gao et al. [15] propose using a distributed object replication architecture where the data stores consistency requirements are adapted on a per-application basis.",
                "These solutions require substantial developer resources and detailed understanding of the application being modified.",
                "While systems that attempt to automate the partitioning and replication of an applications database exist [34], they do not provide full transaction semantics.",

                "Recent work in the evaluation of edge caching options for dynamic web sites [38] has suggested that, without careful planning, employing complex offloading strategies can hurt performance.",
                "Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers except the database should be offloaded to the edge.",

                "To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.",
                "The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are complementary and they would benefit each other.",

                "Even when database content remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors.",
                "In a multitiered architecture, each web request can stress the WAN link between the web server and the database.",
                "This causes user experience to be highly variable because there is no caching to insulate the client from bursty loads.",
                "Previous attempts in caching dynamic database content have generally weakened transactional semantics [3, 4] or required application modifications [15, 34].",
                "We report on a new solution that takes the form of a databaseagnostic middleware layer called Ganesh.",
                "Ganesh makes no effort to semantically interpret the contents of queries or their results.",
                "Instead, it relies exclusively on cryptographic hashing to detect similarities with previous results.",
                "Hash-based similarity detection has seen increasing use in distributed file systems [26, 36, 37] for improving performance on low-bandwidth networks.",
                "However, these techniques have not been used for relational databases.",
                "Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement.",
                "One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based similarity detection to back-end databases.",
                "First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.",
                "This allows hash-based techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.",
                "In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity detection.",
                "Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.",
                "Third, the source code of commercial databases is typically not available.",
                "This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code.",
                "Our experiments show that Ganesh, while conceptually simple, can improve performance significantly at bandwidths representative of todays commercial Internet.",

                "For workloads that were not data-intensive, throughput improvements of up to twofold were observed.",
                "Even when bandwidth was not a constraint, Ganesh had low overhead and did not hurt performance.",

                "It can also increase the availability and scalability of web services.",
                "Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database cannot be cached in the first two tiers.",
                "While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7].",
                "As a result, databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, finance, and online retailing [38].",
                "Thus, the back-end database is usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].",
                "In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. 2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganeshs focus is on efficient transmission of results by discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.",
                "As SQL queries can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results across bandwidth constrained links.",
                "The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2.",
                "These techniques rely on some basic assumptions.",
                "Cryptographic hash functions are assumed to be collision-resistant.",
                "In other words, it is computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.",
                "The functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.",
                "Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.",
                "The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that collisions do not occur.",
                "Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a data item as its unique identifier.",
                "A collection of data items effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.",
                "The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively non-existent has recently come under fire [17].",
                "However, as explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a concern for Ganesh.",
                "All communication is between trusted parts of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to accept invalid data.",
                "Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any specific hash function.",
                "While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it with a different hash function would be simple.",
                "There would be no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g.",
                "SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent.",
                "No re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses hashing on volatile data. 3.",
                "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.",
                "Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways.",
                "For example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different result because of updates to the database; however, there may be significant commonality between the two results.",
                "As another example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence of queries with overlapping results.",
                "When Ganesh detects redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result fragments.",
                "Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash lookup in a cache of previous results.",
                "In effect, Ganesh uses computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.",
                "Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects.",
                "We first explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results.",
                "Next, we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to all components of a multi-tier system.",
                "We then describe Ganeshs proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity. 3.1 Detecting Similarity One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is detected.",
                "There are many potential ways to decompose a result into fragments.",
                "The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the smallest possible object for transmission for a given querys results.",
                "Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice depends on many factors such as the contents of the querys result, the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.",
                "When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30] to detect common data between two objects has been successfully shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].",
                "Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to compute a rolling hash.",
                "Assuming that the hash function is uniformly distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value.",
                "The number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size.",
                "These sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for detecting similarity between different objects.",
                "As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any structural properties of the underlying data.",
                "The algorithm therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions.",
                "However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.",
                "Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort attributes.",
                "In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.",
                "Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more precise boundary detection.",
                "The information we exploit is that a querys result reflects the structure of a relational database where all data is organized as tables and rows.",
                "It is therefore simple to check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first the entire result, and then individual rows.",
                "The end of a row in a result serves as a natural chunk boundary.",
                "It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the data.",
                "Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or integrity constraints.",
                "Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.",
                "If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple result rows.",
                "However, selecting a smaller average chunk size increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.",
                "WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 312 Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganeshs Chunking This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use.",
                "Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks.",
                "Ganesh only needs a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are provided by the datas natural structure.",
                "The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganeshs row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting.",
                "Given that previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to compression algorithms in this paper. 3.2 Transparency The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh to be completely transparent to all components of a typical eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.",
                "Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant real-world impact.",
                "Requiring modifications to any of the above components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption.",
                "Preserving transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.",
                "We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to realizing our goal.",
                "This approach relies on the existence of a compact programming interface that is already widely used by target software.",
                "It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without disrupting existing module structure.",
                "These conditions are easily met in our context because of the popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness systems.",
                "The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even other tabular data repositories such as flat files.",
                "Access to these data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism.",
                "Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.",
                "As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one JDBC driver for another without application modifications.",
                "The JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code interposition.",
                "As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same standardized interface.",
                "The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs reassembly of results.",
                "At the database, we add a new process called the Ganesh proxy.",
                "This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that communicates with the database.",
                "The use of a proxy at the database makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and experimentation.",
                "Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either. 3.3 Proxy-Based Caching The native JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(a) is a lightweight code component supplied by the database vendor.",
                "Its main funcClient Database Web and Application Server Native JDBC Driver WAN (a) Native Architecture Client Database Ganesh Proxy Native JDBC Driver WAN Web and Application Server Ganesh JDBC Driver (b) Ganeshs Interposition-based Architecture Figure 3: Native vs. Ganesh Architecture tion is to mediate communication between the application and the remote database.",
                "It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and responds to application requests to view parts of results.",
                "The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the application with an interface identical to that provided by the native driver.",
                "It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy.",
                "To perform this reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of recentlyreceived results.",
                "This cache is only used as a source of result fragments in reconstructing results.",
                "No attempt is made by the Ganesh driver or proxy to track database updates.",
                "The lack of cache consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no performance benefit from using Ganesh.",
                "Stale data will simply be paged out of the cache over time.",
                "The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).",
                "The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the proxy.",
                "The proxy does not examine any queries received from the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver.",
                "Instead, the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity is found.",
                "While this architecture does not decrease the load on a database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.",
                "To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result fragments are available.",
                "This will result in the smallest possible initial transmission of a result.",
                "However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing result fragments.",
                "To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the state of the Ganesh drivers cache.",
                "Since both components are under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining cache coherence.",
                "Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh drivers cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.",
                "In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing fragments.",
                "If the client detects loss of synchronization with the proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.",
                "Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments themselves, only their hashes.",
                "This allows the proxy to remain scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.",

                "Higher loads are especially useful in understanding Ganeshs performance when the CPU or disk of the database server or proxy is the limiting factor.",
                "A previous study has shown that approximately 50% of the wide-area Internet bottlenecks observed had an available bandwidth under 10 Mb/s [1].",
                "Based on this work, we focus our evaluation on the WAN bandwidth of 5 Mb/s with 66 ms of round-trip latency, representative of severely constrained network paths, and 20 Mb/s with 33 ms of round-trip latency, representative of a moderately constrained network path.",
                "We also report Ganeshs performance at 100 Mb/s with no added round-trip latency.",
                "This bandwidth, representative of an unconstrained network, is especially useful in revealing any potential overhead of Ganesh in situations where WAN bandwidth is not the limiting factor.",
                "For each combination of number of clients and WAN bandwidth, we measured results from the two configurations listed below: • Native: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(a).",
                "Native avoids Ganeshs overhead in using a proxy and performing Java object serialization. • Ganesh: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(b).",
                "For a given number of clients and WAN bandwidth, comparing these results to the corresponding Native results gives the performance benefit due to the Ganesh middleware system.",
                "The metric used to quantify the improvement in throughput is the number of client requests that can be serviced per second.",
                "The metric used to quantify Ganeshs overhead is the average response time for a client request.",
                "For all of the experiments, the Ganesh driver used by the application server used a cache size of 100,000 items1 .",
                "The proxy was effective in tracking the Ganesh drivers cache state; for all of our experiments the miss rate on the driver never exceeded 0.7%. 4.3 Experimental Setup The experimental setup used for the benchmarks can be seen in Figure 5.",
                "All machines were 3.2 GHz Pentium 4s (with HyperThreading enabled.)",

                "The database server had 4 GB of SDRAM.",
                "We used Apaches Tomcat as both the application server that hosted the Java Servlets and the web server.",
                "Both benchmarks used Java Servlets to generate the dynamic content.",
                "The database server used the open source MySQL database.",
                "For the native JDBC drivers, we used the Connector/J drivers provided by MySQL.",
                "The application server used Suns Java Virtual Machine as the runtime environment for the Java Servlets.",
                "The sysstat tool was used to monitor the CPU, network, disk, and memory utilization on all machines.",
                "The machines were connected by a switched gigabit Ethernet network.",
                "As shown in Figure 5, the front-end web and application server was separated from the proxy and database server by a NetEm router [16].",
                "This router allowed us to control the bandwidth and latency settings on the network.",
                "The NetEm router is a standard PC with two network cards running the Linux Traffic Control and Network Emulation software.",
                "The bandwidth and latency constraints were only applied to the link between the application server and the database for the native case and between the application server and the proxy for the Ganesh case.",
                "There is no communication between the application server and the database with Ganesh as all data flows through the proxy.",
                "As our focus was on the WAN link between the application server and the database, there were no constraints on the link between the simulated test clients and the web server. 5.",
                "THROUGHPUT AND RESPONSE TIME In this section, we address the first question raised in Section 4: Can performance can be improved significantly by exploiting similarity across database results?",

                "Natives throughput drops with an increase in test clients as clients timeout due to congestion at the application server.",
                "Usability studies have shown that response times above 10 seconds cause the user to move on to 1 As Java lacks a sizeof() operator, Java caches therefore limit their size based on the number of objects.",

                "As Figure 9 (a) shows, at 5 Mb/s, independent of the test client configuration, Rabin significantly underperforms Ganesh.",
                "This happens because of a combination of two reasons.",
                "First, as outlined in Section 3.1, Rabin finds less similarity as it does not exploit the results structural information.",
                "Second, this benchmark contained some queries that generated large results.",
                "In this case, Rabin, with a small average chunk size, generated a large number of objects that evicted other useful data from the cache.",
                "In contrast, Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly increase the size of the chunks.",
                "This was confirmed as cache statistics showed that Ganeshs hit ratio was roughly three time that of Rabin.",
                "Throughput measurements at 20 Mb/s were similar with the exception of Rabins performance with 400 test clients.",
                "In this case, Ganesh was not network limited and, in fact, the throughput was the same as 400 clients at 5 Mb/s.",
                "Rabin, however, took advantage of the bandwidth increase from 5 to 20 Mb/s to deliver a slightly better performance.",
                "At 100 Mb/s, Rabins throughput was almost similar to Ganesh as bandwidth was no longer a bottleneck.",
                "The normalized response time, presented in Figure 9 (b), shows similar trends.",
                "At 5 and 20 Mb/s, the addition of test clients decreases the normalized response time as Ganeshs average response time increases faster than Rabins.",
                "However, at no point does Rabin outperform Ganesh.",
                "Note that at 400 and 800 clients at 100 Mb/s, Rabin does have a higher overhead even when it is not bandwidth constrained.",
                "As mentioned in Section 3.1, this is due to the fact that Rabin has to hash each ResultSet twice.",
                "The overhead disappears with 1200 and 1600 clients as the database CPU is saturated and limits the performance of both Ganesh and Rabin. 7.",
                "PROXY OVERHEAD In this section, we address the third question raised in Section 4: Is the overhead of Ganeshs proxy-based design acceptable?",
                "To answer this question, we concentrate on its performance at the higher bandwidths.",

                "Ganesh, however, still tracks Native in terms of throughput.",
                "While the average response time is higher for Ganesh, the absolute difference is in between 0.01 and 0.04 seconds and would be imperceptible to the end-user.",

                "In this section, we first discuss alternative approaches to caching dynamic content and then examine other uses of hash-based primitives in distributed systems. 8.1 Caching Dynamic Content At the database layer, a number of systems have advocated middletier caching where parts of the database are replicated at the edge or server [3, 4, 20].",
                "These systems either cache entire tables in what is essentially a replicated database or use materialized views from previous query replies [19].",
                "They require tight integration with the back-end database to ensure a time bound on the propagation of updates.",
                "These systems are also usually targeted towards workloads that do not require strict consistency and can tolerate stale data.",
                "Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.",
                "Gao et al. [15] propose using a distributed object replication architecture where the data stores consistency requirements are adapted on a per-application basis.",
                "These solutions require substantial developer resources and detailed understanding of the application being modified.",
                "While systems that attempt to automate the partitioning and replication of an applications database exist [34], they do not provide full transaction semantics.",
                "In comparison, Ganesh does not weaken any of the semantics provided by the underlying database.",
                "Recent work in the evaluation of edge caching options for dynamic web sites [38] has suggested that, without careful planning, employing complex offloading strategies can hurt performance.",
                "Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers except the database should be offloaded to the edge.",
                "Our evaluation of Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios.",
                "To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.",
                "The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are complementary and they would benefit each other.",
                "Moving up to the presentation layer, there has been widespread adoption of fragment-based caching [14], which improves cache utilization by separately caching different parts of generated web pages.",
                "While fragment-based caching works at the edge, a recent proposal has proposed moving web page assembly to the clients to optimize content delivery [31].",
                "While Ganesh is not used at the presentation layer, the same principles have been applied in Duplicate Transfer Detection [25] to increase web cache efficiency as well as for web access across bandwidth limited links [33]. 8.2 Hash-based Systems The past few years have seen the emergence of many systems that exploit hash-based techniques.",
                "At the heart of all these systems is the idea of detecting similarity in data without requiring interpretation of that data.",
                "This simple yet elegant idea relies on cryptographic hashing, as discussed earlier in Section 2.",
                "Successful applications of this idea span a wide range of storage systems.",

                "Using synchronized caches at both ends of a network link, duplicated data is replaced by smaller tokens for transmission and then restored at the remote end.",
                "This and other hash-based systems such as the CASPER [37] and LBFS [26] filesystems, and Layer-2 bandwidth optimizers such as Riverbed and Peribit use Rabin fingerprinting [30] to discover spans of commonality in data.",
                "This approach is especially useful when data items are modified in-place through insertions, deletions, and updates.",
                "However, as Section 6 shows, the performance of this technique can show a dramatic drop in the presence of data reordering.",
                "Ganesh instead uses row boundaries as dividers for detecting similarity.",
                "The most aggressive use of hash-based techniques is by systems that use hashes as the primary identifiers for objects in persistent storage.",
                "Storage systems such as CFS [12] and PAST [13] that have been built using distributed hash tables fall into this category.",
                "Single Instance Storage [6] and Venti [29] are other examples of such systems.",
                "As discussed in Section 2.2, the use of cryptographic hashes for addressing persistent data represents a deeper level of faith in their collision-resistance than that assumed by Ganesh.",
                "If time reveals shortcomings in the hash algorithm, the effort involved in correcting the flaw is much greater.",
                "In Ganesh, it is merely a matter of replacing the hash algorithm. 9.",
                "CONCLUSION The growing use of dynamic web content generated from relational databases places increased demands on WAN bandwidth.",
                "Traditional caching solutions for bandwidth and latency reduction are often ineffective for such content.",
