Indeed, car manufacturers are already equipping their cars with such devices. Though, currently these systems are a proprietary, we envision a natural evolution where agent applications will be developed for vehicular systems, e.g., to improve car routing in dense urban areas. Nonetheless, this new technology and agent applications may lead to the emergence of self-interested car owners, who will care more about their own welfare than the social welfare of their peers. These car owners will try to manipulate their agents such that they transmit false data to their peers. Using a simulation environment, which models a real transportation network in a large city, we demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents if no counter-measures are implemented. Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Intelligent agents General Terms Experimentation 1. INTRODUCTION As technology advances, more and more cars are being equipped with devices, which enable them to act as autonomous agents. An important advancement in this respect is the introduction of ad-hoc communication networks (such as Wi-Fi), which enable the exchange of information between cars, e.g., for locating road congestions [1] and optimal routes [15] or improving traffic safety [2]. Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) communication is already onboard by some car manufactures, enabling the collaboration between different cars on the road. For example, GMs proprietary algorithm [6], called the threat assessment algorithm, constantly calculates, in real time, other vehicles positions and speeds, and enables messaging other cars when a collision is imminent; Also, Honda has began testing its system in which vehicles talk with each other and with the highway system itself [7]. In this paper, we investigate the attraction of being a selfish agent in vehicular networks. That is, we investigate the benefits achieved by car owners, who tamper with on-board devices and incorporate their own self-interested agents in them, which act for their benefit. We build on the notion of Gossip Networks, introduced by Shavitt and Shay [15], in which the agents can obtain road congestion information by gossiping with peer agents using ad-hoc communication. We recognize two typical behaviors that the self-interested agents could embark upon, in the context of vehicular networks. In the first behavior, described in Section 4, the objective of the self-interested agents is to maximize their own utility, expressed by their average journey duration on the road. This situation can be modeled in real life by car owners, whose aim is to reach their destination as fast as possible, and would like to have their way free of other cars. To this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents, by injecting false information into the network. This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route to other agents in the network in the hope of making the other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing them to choose a different route. The second type of behavior, described in Section 5, is modeled by the self-interested agents objective to cause disorder in the network, more than they are interested in maximizing their own utility. This kind of behavior could be generated, for example, by vandalism or terrorists, who aim to cause as much mayhem in the network as possible. We note that the introduction of self-interested agents to the network, would most probably motivate other agents to try and detect these agents in order to minimize their effect. This is similar, though in a different context, to the problem introduced by Lamport et al. [8] as the Byzantine Generals Problem. However, the introduction of mechanisms to deal with self-interested agents is costly and time consuming. In this paper we focus mainly on the attractiveness of selfish behavior by these agents, while we also provide some insights 327 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS into the possibility of detecting self-interested agents and minimizing their effect. To demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents, we have used a simulation environment, which models the transportation network in a central part of a large real city. The simulation environment is further described in Section 3. Our simulations provide insights to the benefits of self-interested agents cheating. Our findings can motivate future research in this field in order to minimize the effect of selfish-agents. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review related work in the field of self-interested agents and V2V communications. We continue and formally describe our environment and simulation settings in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 describe the different behaviors of the selfinterested agents and our findings. Finally, we conclude the paper with open questions and future research directions. 2. RELATED WORK In their seminal paper, Lamport et al. [8] describe the Byzantine Generals problem, in which processors need to handle malfunctioning components that give conflicting information to different parts of the system. They also present a model in which not all agents are connected, and thus an agent cannot send a message to all the other agents. Dolev et al. [5] has built on this problem and has analyzed the number of faulty agents that can be tolerated in order to eventually reach the right conclusion about true data. Similar work is presented by Minsky et al. [11], who discuss techniques for constructing gossip protocols that are resilient to up to t malicious host failures. As opposed to the above works, our work focuses on vehicular networks, in which the agents are constantly roaming the network and exchanging data. Also, the domain of transportation networks introduces dynamic data, as the load of the roads is subject to change. In addition, the system in transportation networks has a feedback mechanism, since the load in the roads depends on the reports and the movement of the agents themselves. Malkhi et al. [10] present a gossip algorithm for propagating information in a network of processors, in the presence of malicious parties. Their algorithm prevents the spreading of spurious gossip and diffuses genuine data. This is done in time, which is logarithmic in the number of processes and linear in the number of corrupt parties. Nevertheless, their work assumes that the network is static and also that the agents are static (they discuss a network of processors). This is not true for transportation networks. For example, in our model, agents might gossip about heavy traffic load of a specific road, which is currently jammed, yet this information might be false several minutes later, leaving the agents to speculate whether the spreading agents are indeed malicious or not. In addition, as the agents are constantly moving, each agent cannot choose with whom he interacts and exchanges data. In the context of analyzing the data and deciding whether the data is true or not, researchers have focused on distributed reputation systems or decision mechanisms to decide whether or not to share data. Yu and Singh [18] build a social network of agents reputations. Every agent keeps a list of its neighbors, which can be changed over time, and computes the trustworthiness of other agents by updating the current values of testimonies obtained from reliable referral chains. After a bad experience with another agent every agent decreases the rating of the bad agent and propagates this bad experience throughout the network so that other agents can update their ratings accordingly. This approach might be implemented in our domain to allow gossip agents to identify self-interested agents and thus minimize their effect. However, the implementation of such a mechanism is an expensive addition to the infrastructure of autonomous agents in transportation networks. This is mainly due to the dynamic nature of the list of neighbors in transportation networks. Thus, not only does it require maintaining the neighbors list, since the neighbors change frequently, but it is also harder to build a good reputation system. Leckie et al. [9] focus on the issue of when to share information between the agents in the network. Their domain involves monitoring distributed sensors. Each agent monitors a subset of the sensors and evaluates a hypothesis based on the local measurements of its sensors. If the agent believes that a hypothesis is sufficient likely he exchanges this information with the other agents. In their domain, the goal of all the agents is to reach a global consensus about the likelihood of the hypothesis. In our domain, however, as the agents constantly move, they have many samples, which they exchange with each other. Also, the data might also vary (e.g., a road might be reported as jammed, but a few minutes later it could be free), thus making it harder to decide whether to trust the agent, who sent the data. Moreover, the agent might lie only about a subset of its samples, thus making it even harder to detect his cheating. Some work has been done in the context of gossip networks or transportation networks regarding the spreading of data and its dissemination. Datta et al. [4] focus on information dissemination in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET). They propose an autonomous gossiping algorithm for an infrastructure-less mobile ad-hoc networking environment. Their autonomous gossiping algorithm uses a greedy mechanism to spread data items in the network. The data items are spread to immediate neighbors that are interested in the information, and avoid ones that are not interested. The decision which node is interested in the information is made by the data item itself, using heuristics. However, their work concentrates on the movement of the data itself, and not on the agents who propagate the data. This is different from our scenario in which each agent maintains the data it has gathered, while the agent itself roams the road and is responsible (and has the capabilities) for spreading the data to other agents in the network. Das et al. [3] propose a cooperative strategy for content delivery in vehicular networks. In their domain, peers download a file from a mesh and exchange pieces of the file among themselves. We, on the other hand, are interested in vehicular networks in which there is no rule forcing the agents to cooperate among themselves. Shibata et al. [16] propose a method for cars to cooperatively and autonomously collect traffic jam statistics to estimate arrival time to destinations for each car. The communication is based on IEEE 802.11, without using a fixed infrastructure on the ground. While we use the same domain, we focus on a different problem. Shibata et al. [16] mainly focus on efficiently broadcasting the data between agents (e.g., avoid duplicates and communication overhead), as we focus on the case where agents are not cooperative in 328 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) nature, and on how selfish agents affect other agents and the network load. Wang et al. [17] also assert, in the context of wireless networks, that individual agents are likely to do what is most beneficial for their owners, and will act selfishly. They design a protocol for communication in networks in which all agents are selfish. Their protocol motivates every agent to maximize its profit only when it behaves truthfully (a mechanism of incentive compatibility). However, the domain of wireless networks is quite different from the domain of transportation networks. In the wireless network, the wireless terminal is required to contribute its local resources to transmit data. Thus, Wang et al. [17] use a payment mechanism, which attaches costs to terminals when transmitting data, and thus enables them to maximize their utility when transmitting data, instead of acting selfishly. Unlike this, in the context of transportation networks, constructing such a mechanism is not quite a straightforward task, as self-interested agents and regular gossip agents might incur the same cost when transmitting data. The difference between the two types of agents only exists regarding the credibility of the data they exchange. In the next section, we will describe our transportation network model and gossiping between the agents. We will also describe the different agents in our system. 3. MODEL AND SIMULATIONS We first describe the formal transportation network model, and then we describe the simulations designs. 3.1 Formal Model Following Shavitt and Shay [15] and Parshani [13], the transportation network is represented by a directed graph G(V, E), where V is the set of vertices representing junctions, and E is the set of edges, representing roads. An edge e ∈ E is associated with a weight w > 0, which specifies the time it takes to traverse the road associated with that edge. The roads weights vary in time according to the network (traffic) load. Each car, which is associated with an autonomous agent, is given a pair of origin and destination points (vertices). A journey is defined as the (not necessarily simple) path taken by an agent between the origin vertex and the destination vertex. We assume that there is always a path between a source and a destination. A journey length is defined as the sum of all weights of the edges constituting this path. Every agent has to travel between its origin and destination points and aims to minimize its journey length. Initially, agents are ignorant about the state of the roads. Regular agents are only capable of gathering information about the roads as they traverse them. However, we assume that some agents have means of inter-vehicle communication (e.g., IEEE 802.11) with a given communication range, which enables them to communicate with other agents with the same device. Those agents are referred to as gossip agents. Since the communication range is limited, the exchange of information using gossiping is done in one of two ways: (a) between gossip agents passing one another, or (b) between gossip agents located at the same junction. We assume that each agent stores the most recent information it has received or gathered around the edges in the network. A subset of the gossip agents are those agents who are selfinterested and manipulate the devices for their own benefit. We will refer to these agents as self-interested agents. A detailed description of their behavior is given in Sections 4 and 5. 3.2 Simulation Design Building on [13], the network in our simulations replicates a central part of a large city, and consists of 50 junctions and 150 roads, which are approximately the number of main streets in the city. Each simulation consists of 6 iterations. The basic time unit of the iteration is a step, which equivalents to about 30 seconds. Each iteration simulates six hours of movements. The average number of cars passing through the network during the iteration is about 70,000 and the average number of cars in the network at a specific time unit is about 3,500 cars. In each iteration the same agents are used with the same origin and destination points, whereas the data collected in earlier iterations is preserved in the future iterations (referred to as the history of the agent). This allows us to simulate somewhat a daily routine in the transportation network (e.g., a working week). Each of the experiments that we describe below is run with 5 different traffic scenarios. Each such traffic scenario differs from one another by the initial load of the roads and the designated routes of the agents (cars) in the network. For each such scenario 5 simulations are run, creating a total of 25 simulations for each experiment. It has been shown by Parshani et al. [13, 14] that the information propagation in the network is very efficient when the percentage of gossiping agents is 10% or more. Yet, due to congestion caused by too many cars rushing to what is reported as the less congested part of the network 20-30% of gossiping agents leads to the most efficient routing results in their experiments. Thus, in our simulation, we focus only on simulations in which the percentage of gossip agents is 20%. The simulations were done with different percentages of self-interested agents. To gain statistical significance we ran each simulation with changes in the set of the gossip agents, and the set of the self-interested agents. In order to gain a similar ordinal scale, the results were normalized. The normalized values were calculated by comparing each agents result to his results when the same scenario was run with no self-interested agents. This was done for all of the iterations. Using the normalized values enabled us to see how worse (or better) each agent would perform compared to the basic setting. For example, if an average journey length of a certain agent in iteration 1 with no selfinterested agent was 50, and the length was 60 in the same scenario and iteration in which self-interested agents were involved, then the normalized value for that agent would be 60/50 = 1.2. More details regarding the simulations are described in Sections 4 and 5. 4. SPREADING LIES, MAXIMIZING UTILITY In the first set of experiments we investigated the benefits achieved by the self-interested agents, whose aim was to minimize their own journey length. The self-interested agents adopted a cheating approach, in which they sent false data to their peers. In this section we first describe the simulations with the self-interested agents. Then, we model the scenario as a The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 329 game with two types of agents, and prove that the equilibrium result can only be achieved when there is no efficient exchange of gossiping information in the network. 4.1 Modeling the Self-Interested Agents Behavior While the gossip agents gather data and send it to other agents, the self-interested agents behavior is modeled as follows: 1. Calculate the shortest path from origin to destination. 2. Communicate the following data to other agents: (a) If the road is not in the agents route - send the true data about it (e.g., data about roads it has received from other agents) (b) For all roads in the agents route, which the agent has not yet traversed, send a random high weight. Basically, the self-interested agent acts the same as the gossip agent. It collects data regarding the weight of the roads (either by traversing the road or by getting the data from other agents) and sends the data it has collected to other agents. However, the self-interested agent acts differently when the road is in its route. Since the agents goal is to reach its destination as fast as possible, the agent will falsely report that all the roads in its route are heavily congested. This is in order to free the path for itself, by making other agents recalculate their paths, this time without including roads on the self-interested agents route. To this end, for all the roads in its route, which the agent has not yet passed, the agent generates a random weight, which is above the average weight of the roads in the network. It then associates these new weights with the roads in its route and sends them to the other agents. While an agent can also divert cars from its route by falsely reporting congested roads in parallel to its route as free, this behavior is not very likely since other agents, attempting to use the roads, will find the mistake within a short time and spread the true congestion on the road. On the other hand, if an agent manages to persuade other agents not to use a road, it will be harder for them to detect that the said roads are not congested. In addition, to avoid being influenced by its own lies and other lies spreading in the network, all self-interested agents will ignore data received about roads with heavy traffic (note that data about roads that are not heavily traffic will not be ignored)1 . In the next subsection we describe the simulation results, involving the self-interested agents. 4.2 Simulation Results To test the benefits of cheating by the self-interested agents we ran several experiments. In the first set of experiments, we created a scenario, in which a small group of self-interested agents spread lies on the same route, and tested its effect on the journey length of all the agents in the network. 1 In other simulations we have run, in which there had been several real congestions in the network, we indeed saw that even when the roads are jammed, the self-interested agents were less affected if they ignored all reported heavy traffic, since by such they also discarded all lies roaming the network Table 1: Normalized journey length values, selfinterested agents with the same route Iteration Self-Interested Gossip - Gossip - Regular Number Agents SR Others Agents 1 1.38 1.27 1.06 1.06 2 0.95 1.56 1.18 1.14 3 1.00 1.86 1.28 1.17 4 1.06 2.93 1.35 1.16 5 1.13 2.00 1.40 1.17 6 1.08 2.02 1.43 1.18 Thus, several cars, which had the same origin and destination points, were designated as self-interested agents. In this simulation, we selected only 6 agents to be part of the group of the self-interested agents, as we wanted to investigate the effect achieved by only a small number of agents. In each simulation in this experiment, 6 different agents were randomly chosen to be part of the group of self-interested agents, as described above. In addition, one road, on the route of these agents, was randomly selected to be partially blocked, letting only one car go through that road at each time step. About 8,000 agents were randomly selected as regular gossip agents, and the other 32,000 agents were designated as regular agents. We analyzed the average journey length of the self-interested agents as opposed to the average journey length of other regular gossip agents traveling along the same route. Table 1 summarizes the normalized results for the self-interested agents, the gossip agents (those having the same origin and destination points as the self-interested agents, denoted Gossip - SR, and all other gossip agents, denoted Gossip - Others) and the regular agents, as a function of the iteration number. We can see from the results that the first time the selfinterested agents traveled the route while spreading the false data about the roads did not help them (using the paired t-test we show that those agents had significantly lower journey lengths in the scenario in which they did not spread any lies, with p < 0.01). This is mainly due to the fact that the lies do not bypass the self-interested agent and reach other cars that are ahead of the self-interested car on the same route. Thus, spreading the lies in the first iteration does not help the self-interested agent to free the route he is about to travel, in the first iteration. Only when the self-interested agents had repeated their journey in the next iteration (iteration 2) did it help them significantly (p = 0.04). The reason for this is that other gossip agents received this data and used it to recalculate their shortest path, thus avoiding entrance to the roads, for which the self-interested agents had spread false information about congestion. It is also interesting to note the large value attained by the self-interested agents in the first iteration. This is mainly due to several self-interested agents, who entered the jammed road. This situation occurred since the self-interested agents ignored all heavy traffic data, and thus ignored the fact that the road was jammed. As they started spreading lies about this road, more cars shifted from this route, thus making the road free for the future iterations. However, we also recall that the self-interested agents ignore all information about the heavy traffic roads. Thus, 330 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Table 2: Normalized journey length values, spreading lies for a beneficiary agent Iteration Beneficiary Gossip - Gossip - Regular Number Agent SR Others Agents 1 1.10 1.05 0.94 1.11 2 1.09 1.14 0.99 1.14 3 1.04 1.19 1.02 1.14 4 1.03 1.26 1.03 1.14 5 1.05 1.32 1.05 1.12 6 0.92 1.40 1.06 1.11 when the network becomes congested, more self-interested cars are affected, since they might enter jammed roads, which they would otherwise not have entered. This can be seen, for example, in iterations 4-6, in which the normalized value of the self-interested agents increased above 1.00. Using the paired t-test to compare these values with the values achieved by these agents when no lies are used, we see that there is no significant difference between the two scenarios. As opposed to the gossip agents, we can see how little effect the self-interested agents have on the regular agents. As compared to the gossip agents on the same route that have traveled as much as 193% more, when self-interested agents are introduced, the average journey length for the regular agents has only increased by about 15%. This result is even lower than the effect on other gossip agents in the entire network. Since we noticed that cheating by the self-interested agents does not benefit them in the first iteration, we devised another set of experiments. In the second set of experiments, the self-interested agents have the objective to help another agent, who is supposed to enter the network some time after the self-interested agent entered. We refer to the latter agent as the beneficiary agent. Just like a self-interested agent, the beneficiary agent also ignores all data regarding heavy traffic. In real-life this can be modeled, for example, by a husband, who would like to help his wife find a faster route to her destination. Table 2 summarizes the normalized values for the different agents. As in the first set of experiments, 5 simulations were run for each scenario, with a total of 25 simulations. In each of these simulation one agent was randomly selected as a self-interested agent, and then another agent, with the same origin as the selfinterested agent, was randomly selected as the beneficiary agent. The other 8,000 and 32,000 agents were designated as regular gossip agents and regular agents, respectively. We can see that as the number of iterations advances, the lower the normalized value for the beneficiary agent. In this scenario, just like the previous one, in the first iterations, not only does the beneficiary agent not avoid the jammed roads, since he ignores all heavy traffic, he also does not benefit from the lies spread by the self-interested agent. This is due to the fact that the lies are not yet incorporated by other gossip agents. Thus, if we compare the average journey length in the first iteration when lies are spread and when there are no lies, the average is significantly lower when there are no lies (p < 0.03). On the other hand, if we compare the average journey length in all of the iterations, there is no significant difference between the two settings. Still, in most of the iterations, the average journey length of the beneficiary agent is longer than in the case when no lies are spread. We can also see the impact on the other agents in the system. While the gossip agents, which are not on the route of the beneficiary agent, virtually are not affected by the self-interested agent, those on the route and the regular agents are affected and have higher normalized values. That is, even with just one self-interested car, we can see that both the gossip agents that follow the same route as the lies spread by the self-interested agents, and other regular agents, increase their journey length by more than 14%. In our third set of experiments we examined a setting in which there was an increasing number of agents, and the agents did not necessarily have the same origin and destination points. To model this we randomly selected selfinterested agents, whose objective was to minimize their average journey length, assuming the cars were repeating their journeys (that is, more than one iteration was made). As opposed to the first set of experiments, in this set the self-interested agents were selected randomly, and we did not enforce the constraint that they will all have the same origin and destination points. As in the previous sets of experiments we ran 5 different simulations per scenario. In each simulation 11 runs were made, each run with different numbers of self-interested agents: 0 (no self-interested agents), 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Each agent adopted the behavior modeled in Section 4.1. Figure 1 shows the normalized value achieved by the self-interested agents as a function of their number. The figure shows these values for iterations 2-6. The first iteration is not shown intentionally, as we assume repeated journeys. Also, we have seen in the previous set of experiments and we have provided explanations as to why the self-interested agents do not gain much from their behavior in the first iteration. 0.955 0.96 0.965 0.97 0.975 0.98 0.985 0.99 0.995 1 1.005 1.01 1.015 1.02 1.025 1.03 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10111213141516 Self-Interested Agents Number NormalizedValue Iteration 2 Iteration 3 Iteration 4 Iteration 5 Iteration 6 Figure 1: Self-interested agents normalized values as a function of the number of self-interested agents. Using these simulations we examined what the threshold could be for the number of randomly selected self-interested agents in order to allow themselves to benefit from their selfish behavior. We can see that up to 8 self-interested agents, the average normalized value is below 1. That is, they benefit from their malicious behavior. In the case of one self-interested agent there is a significant difference between the average journey length of when the agent spread lies and when no lies are spread (p < 0.001), while when The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 331 there are 2, 4, 8 and 16 self-interested agents there is no significance difference. Yet, as the number of self-interested agents increases, the normalized value also increases. In such cases, the normalized value is larger than 1, and the self-interested agents journey length becomes significantly higher than their journey length, in cases where there are no self-interested agents in the system. In the next subsection we analyze the scenario as a game and show that when in equilibrium the exchange of gossiping between the agents becomes inefficient. 4.3 When Gossiping is Inefficient We continued and modeled our scenario as a game, in order to find the equilibrium. There are two possible types for the agents: (a) regular gossip agents, and (b) self-interested agents. Each of these agents is a representative of its group, and thus all agents in the same group have similar behavior. We note that the advantage of using gossiping in transportation networks is to allow the agents to detect anomalies in the network (e.g., traffic jams) and to quickly adapt to them by recalculating their routes [14]. We also assume that the objective of the self-interested agents is to minimize their own journey length, thus they spread lies on their routes, as described in Section 4.1. We also assume that sophisticated methods for identifying the self-interested agents or managing reputation are not used. This is mainly due to the complexity of incorporating and maintaining such mechanisms, as well as due to the dynamics of the network, in which interactions between different agents are frequent, agents may leave the network, and data about the road might change as time progresses (e.g., a road might be reported by a regular gossip agent as free at a given time, yet it may currently be jammed due to heavy traffic on the road). Let Tavg be the average time it takes to traverse an edge in the transportation network (that is, the average load of an edge). Let Tmax be the maximum time it takes to traverse an edge. We will investigate the game, in which the self-interested and the regular gossip agents can choose the following actions. The self-interested agents can choose how much to lie, that is, they can choose to spread how long (not necessarily the true duration) it takes to traverse certain roads. Since the objective of the self-interested agents is to spread messages as though some roads are jammed, the traversal time they report is obviously larger than the average time. We denote the time the self-interested agents spread as Ts, such that Tavg ≤ Ts ≤ Tmax. Motivated by the results of the simulations we have described above, we saw that the agents are less affected if they discard the heavy traffic values. Thus, the regular gossip cars, attempting to mitigate the effect of the liars, can choose a strategy to ignore abnormal congestion values above a certain threshold, Tg. Obviously, Tavg ≤ Tg ≤ Tmax. In order to prevent the gossip agents from detecting the lies and just discarding those values, the self-interested agents send lies in a given range, [Ts, Tmax], with an inverse geometric distribution, that is, the higher the T value, the higher its frequency. Now we construct the utility functions for each type of agents, which is defined by the values of Ts and Tg. If the self-interested agents spread traversal times higher than or equal to the regular gossip cars threshold, they will not benefit from those lies. Thus, the utility value of the selfinterested agents in this case is 0. On the other hand, if the self-interested agents spread traversal time which is lower than the threshold, they will gain a positive utility value. From the regular gossip agents point-of-view, if they accept messages from the self-interested agents, then they incorporate the lies in their calculation, thus they will lose utility points. On the other hand, if they discard the false values the self-interested agents send, that is, they do not incorporate the lies, they will gain utility values. Formally, we use us to denote the utility of the self-interested agents and ug to denote the utility of the regular gossip agents. We also denote the strategy profile in the game as {Ts, Tg}. The utility functions are defined as: us = 0 if Ts ≥ Tg Ts − Tavg + 1 if Ts < Tg (1) ug = Tg − Tavg if Ts ≥ Tg Ts − Tg if Ts < Tg (2) We are interested in finding the Nash equilibrium. We recall from [12], that the Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile, where no player has anything to gain by deviating from his strategy, given that the other agent follows his strategy profile. Formally, let (S, u) denote the game, where S is the set of strategy profiles and u is the set of utility functions. When each agent i ∈ {regular gossip, self-interested} chooses a strategy Ti resulting in a strategy profile T = (Ts, Tg) then agent i obtains a utility of ui (T). A strategy profile T∗ ∈ S is a Nash equilibrium if no deviation in the strategy by any single agent is profitable, that is, if for all i, ui (T∗ ) ≥ ui (Ti, T∗ −i). That is, (Ts, Tg) is a Nash equilibrium if the self-interested agents have no other value Ts such that us (Ts, Tg) > us (Ts, Tg), and similarly for the gossip agents. We now have the following theorem. Theorem 4.1. (Tavg, Tavg) is the only Nash equilibrium. Proof. First we will show that (Tavg, Tavg) is a Nash equilibrium. Assume, by contradiction, that the gossip agents choose another value Tg > Tavg. Thus, ug (Tavg, Tg ) = Tavg − Tg < 0. On the other hand, ug (Tavg, Tavg) = 0. Thus, the regular gossip agents have no incentive to deviate from this strategy. The self-interested agents also have no incentive to deviate from this strategy. By contradiction, again assume that the self-interested agents choose another value Ts > Tavg. Thus, us (Ts , Tavg) = 0, while us (Tavg, Tavg) = 0. We will now show that the above solution is unique. We will show that any other tuple (Ts, Tg), such that Tavg < Tg ≤ Tmax and Tavg < Ts ≤ Tmax is not a Nash equilibrium. We have three cases. In the first Tavg < Tg < Ts ≤ Tmax. Thus, us (Ts, Tg) = 0 and ug (Ts, Tg) = Tg − Tavg. In this case, the regular gossip agents have an incentive to deviate and choose another strategy Tg + 1, since by doing so they increase their own utility: ug (Ts, Tg + 1) = Tg + 1 − Tavg. In the second case we have Tavg < Ts < Tg ≤ Tmax. Thus, ug (Ts, Tg) = Ts − Tg < 0. Also, the regular gossip agents have an incentive to deviate and choose another strategy Tg −1, in which their utility value is higher: ug (Ts, Tg −1) = Ts − Tg + 1. In the last case we have Tavg < Ts = Tg ≤ Tmax. Thus, us (Ts, Tg) = Ts − Tg = 0. In this case, the self-interested agents have an incentive to deviate and choose another strategy Tg − 1, in which their utility value is higher: us (Tg − 1, Tg) = Tg − 1 − Tavg + 1 = Tg − Tavg > 0. 332 The Sixth Intl.

Thus, for this equilibrium point the exchange of gossiping information between agents is inefficient, as the gossip agents are unable to detect any anomalies in the network. In the next section we describe another scenario for the self-interested agents, in which they are not concerned with their own utility, but rather interested in maximizing the average journey length of other gossip agents. 5. SPREADING LIES, CAUSING CHAOS Another possible behavior that can be adopted by selfinterested agents is characterized by their goal to cause disorder in the network. This can be achieved, for example, by maximizing the average journey length of all agents, even at the cost of maximizing their own journey length. To understand the vulnerability of the gossip based transportation support system, we ran 5 different simulations for each scenario. In each simulation different agents were randomly chosen (using a uniform distribution) to act as gossip agents, among them self-interested agents were chosen. Each self-interested agent behaved in the same manner as described in Section 4.1. Every simulation consisted of 11 runs with each run comprising different numbers of self-interested agents: 0 (no selfinterested agents), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 50, 64, 80 and 100. Also, in each run the number of self-interested agents was increased incrementally. For example: the run with 50 selfinterested agents consisted of all the self-interested agents that were used in the run with 32 self-interested agents, but with an additional 18 self-interested agents. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the normalized journey length for the self-interested agents, the regular gossip agents and the regular (non-gossip) agents. Table 3 summarizes the data for the first iteration and Table 4 summarizes the data for the average of all iterations. Figure 2 demonstrates the changes in the normalized values for the regular gossip agents and the regular agents, as a function of the iteration number. Similar to the results in our first set of experiments, described in Section 4.2, we can see that randomly selected self-interested agents who follow different randomly selected routes do not benefit from their malicious behavior (that is, their average journey length does not decrease). However, when only one self-interested agent is involved, it does benefit from the malicious behavior, even in the first iteration. The results also indicate that the regular gossip agents are more sensitive to malicious behavior than regular agentsthe average journey length for the gossip agents increases significantly (e.g., with 32 self-interested agents the average journey length for the gossip agents was 146% higher than in the setting with no self-interested agents at all, as opposed to an increase of only 25% for the regular agents). In contrast, these results also indicate that the self-interested agents do not succeed in causing a significant load in the network by their malicious behavior. 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 1 2 3 4 5 6 Iteration Number NormalizedValue 32 self-interested agents, gossip agents normalized value 100 self-interested agents, gossip agents normalized value 32 self-interested agents, regular agents normalized value 100 self-interested agents, regular agents normalized value Figure 2: Gossip and regular agents normalized values, as a function of the iteration. Since the goal of the self-interested agents in this case is to cause disorder in the network rather than use the lies for their own benefits, the question arises as to why would the behavior of the self-interested agents be to send lies about their routes only. Furthermore, we hypothesize that if they all send lies about the same major roads the damage they might inflict on the entire network would be larger that had each of them sent lies about its own route. To examine this hypothesis, we designed another set of experiments. In this set of experiments, all the self-interested agents spread lies about the same 13 main roads in the network. However, the results show quite a smaller impact on other gossip and reguThe Sixth Intl.

The average normalized value for the gossip agents in these simulations was only about 1.07, as opposed to 1.7 in the original scenario. When analyzing the results we saw that although the false data was spread, it did not cause other gossip cars to change their route. The main reason was that the lies were spread on roads that were not on the route of the self-interested agents. Thus, it took the data longer to reach agents on the main roads, and when the agents reached the relevant roads this data was too old to be incorporated in the other agents calculations. We also examined the impact of sending lies in order to cause chaos when there are already congestions in the network. To this end, we simulated a network in which 13 main roads are jammed. The behavior of the self-interested agents is as described in Section 4.1, and the self-interested agents spread lies about their own route. The simulation results, detailed in Table 5, show that there is a greater incentive for the self-interested agents to cheat when the network is already congested, as their cheating causes more damage to the other agents in the network. For example, whereas the average journey length of the regular agents increased only by about 15% in the original scenario, in which the network was not congested, in this scenario the average journey length of the agents had increased by about 60%. 6. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we investigated the benefits achieved by self-interested agents in vehicular networks. Using simulations we investigated two behaviors that might be taken by self-interested agents: (a) trying to minimize their journey length, and (b) trying to cause chaos in the network. Our simulations indicate that in both behaviors the selfinterested agents have only limited success achieving their goal, even if no counter-measures are taken. This is in contrast to the greater impact inflicted by self-interested agents in other domains (e.g., E-Commerce). Some reasons for this are the special characteristics of vehicular networks and their dynamic nature. While the self-interested agents spread lies, they cannot choose which agents with whom they will interact. Also, by the time their lies reach other agents, they might become irrelevant, as more recent data has reached the same agents. Motivated by the simulation results, future research in this field will focus on modeling different behaviors of the self-interested agents, which might cause more damage to the network. Another research direction would be to find ways of minimizing the effect of selfish-agents by using distributed reputation or other measures. 7. REFERENCES [1] A. Bejan and R. Lawrence.

De hecho, los fabricantes de automóviles ya están equipando sus automóviles con tales dispositivos. Sin embargo, actualmente estos sistemas son propietarios, imaginamos una evolución natural donde se desarrollarán aplicaciones de agentes para sistemas vehiculares, por ejemplo, para mejorar el enrutamiento de automóviles en áreas urbanas densas. No obstante, esta nueva tecnología y aplicaciones de agentes puede conducir a la aparición de propietarios de automóviles interesados, que se preocuparán más por su propio bienestar que por el bienestar social de sus compañeros. Estos propietarios de automóviles intentarán manipular a sus agentes de manera que transmitan datos falsos a sus compañeros. Utilizando un entorno de simulación, que modela una red de transporte real en una ciudad grande, demostramos los beneficios logrados por los agentes egoístas si no se implementan contramedidas. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos I.2.11 [Inteligencia artificial]: Agentes de inteligencia artificiales distribuidos-Inteligentes Términos generales Experimentación 1. Introducción A medida que avanza la tecnología, más y más automóviles están equipados con dispositivos, lo que les permite actuar como agentes autónomos. Un avance importante a este respecto es la introducción de redes de comunicación ad-hoc (como Wi-Fi), que permiten el intercambio de información entre los automóviles, por ejemplo, para localizar las congestiones viales [1] y las rutas óptimas [15] o mejorar el tráficoseguridad [2]. La comunicación de vehículos a vehículos (V2V) ya está a bordo de algunos fabricantes de automóviles, lo que permite la colaboración entre diferentes automóviles en la carretera. Por ejemplo, el algoritmo propietario de GMS [6], llamado algoritmo de evaluación de amenazas, calcula constantemente, en tiempo real, posiciones y velocidades de otros vehículos, y permite mensajes de mensajes de otros autos cuando una colisión es inminente;Además, Honda ha comenzado a probar su sistema en el que los vehículos hablan entre sí y con el sistema de carreteras en sí [7]. En este artículo, investigamos la atracción de ser un agente egoísta en las redes vehiculares. Es decir, investigamos los beneficios logrados por los propietarios de automóviles, que manipulan los dispositivos a bordo e incorporan sus propios agentes interesados en ellos, que actúan para su beneficio. Construimos sobre la noción de redes de chismes, introducidas por Shavitt y Shay [15], en la que los agentes pueden obtener información de congestión vial mediante el chismoso con agentes de pares utilizando la comunicación ad-hoc. Reconocemos dos comportamientos típicos que los agentes interesados podrían embarcarse, en el contexto de las redes vehiculares. En el primer comportamiento, descrito en la Sección 4, el objetivo de los agentes interesados es maximizar su propia utilidad, expresada por su duración promedio del viaje en el camino. Esta situación puede ser modelada en la vida real por los propietarios de automóviles, cuyo objetivo es llegar a su destino lo más rápido posible, y le gustaría estar libres de otros automóviles. Con este fin, dejarán que sus agentes engañen a los otros agentes, inyectando información falsa en la red. Esto se logra informando valores de tráfico pesados para las carreteras en su ruta a otros agentes en la red con la esperanza de hacer que los otros agentes crean que la ruta está atascada y hace que elijan una ruta diferente. El segundo tipo de comportamiento, descrito en la Sección 5, es modelado por los agentes interesados en el objetivo de causar desorden en la red, más de lo que están interesados en maximizar su propia utilidad. Este tipo de comportamiento podría ser generado, por ejemplo, por vandalismo o terroristas, que tienen como objetivo causar la mayor cantidad de caos posible en la red. Observamos que la introducción de agentes interesados en la red probablemente motivaría a otros agentes a tratar de detectar a estos agentes para minimizar su efecto. Esto es similar, aunque en un contexto diferente, al problema introducido por Lamport et al.[8] Como el problema de los generales bizantinos. Sin embargo, la introducción de mecanismos para lidiar con los agentes egoístas es costosa y lleva mucho tiempo. En este artículo nos centramos principalmente en el atractivo del comportamiento egoísta por parte de estos agentes, mientras que también proporcionamos algunas ideas 327 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas a la posibilidad de detectar agentes interestimales y minimizando suefecto. Para demostrar los beneficios logrados por los agentes egoístas, hemos utilizado un entorno de simulación, que modela la red de transporte en una parte central de una gran ciudad real. El entorno de simulación se describe más a fondo en la Sección 3. Nuestras simulaciones proporcionan información sobre los beneficios de los agentes egoístas que hacen trampa. Nuestros hallazgos pueden motivar la investigación futura en este campo para minimizar el efecto de los agentes egoístas. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado en el campo de los agentes egoístas y las comunicaciones V2V. Continuamos y describimos formalmente nuestra configuración de entorno y simulación en la Sección 3. Las secciones 4 y 5 describen los diferentes comportamientos de los agentes interesados y nuestros hallazgos. Finalmente, concluimos el documento con preguntas abiertas y direcciones de investigación futuras.2. Trabajo relacionado en su papel seminal, Lamport et al.[8] Describa el problema de los generales bizantinos, en el que los procesadores necesitan manejar componentes que funcionen mal que brindan información conflictiva a diferentes partes del sistema. También presentan un modelo en el que no todos los agentes están conectados y, por lo tanto, un agente no puede enviar un mensaje a todos los demás agentes. Dolev et al.[5] se ha basado en este problema y ha analizado el número de agentes defectuosos que se pueden tolerar para alcanzar la conclusión correcta sobre los datos verdaderos. El trabajo similar es presentado por Minsky et al.[11], quienes discuten técnicas para construir protocolos de chismes que son resistentes a las fallas de los huéspedes maliciosos. A diferencia de los trabajos anteriores, nuestro trabajo se centra en las redes vehiculares, en las que los agentes deambulan constantemente la red e intercambian datos. Además, el dominio de las redes de transporte introduce datos dinámicos, ya que la carga de las carreteras está sujeta a cambios. Además, el sistema en las redes de transporte tiene un mecanismo de retroalimentación, ya que la carga en las carreteras depende de los informes y el movimiento de los propios agentes. Malkhi et al.[10] Presente un algoritmo de chismes para propagar información en una red de procesadores, en presencia de fiestas maliciosas. Su algoritmo evita la propagación de chismes espurios y difunde datos genuinos. Esto se hace a tiempo, que es logarítmico en el número de procesos y lineal en el número de partes corruptas. Sin embargo, su trabajo supone que la red es estática y también que los agentes son estáticos (discuten una red de procesadores). Esto no es cierto para las redes de transporte. Por ejemplo, en nuestro modelo, los agentes pueden cotillearse sobre la carga de tráfico pesado de una carretera específica, que actualmente está atascada, sin embargo, esta información podría ser falsa varios minutos después, dejando a los agentes especular si los agentes de propagación son realmente maliciosos o no. Además, a medida que los agentes se mueven constantemente, cada agente no puede elegir con quién interactúa e intercambia datos. En el contexto del análisis de los datos y decidir si los datos son verdaderos o no, los investigadores se han centrado en sistemas de reputación distribuidos o mecanismos de decisión para decidir si compartir o no datos. Yu y Singh [18] construyen una red social de reputación de agentes. Cada agente mantiene una lista de sus vecinos, que se pueden cambiar con el tiempo, y calcula la confiabilidad de otros agentes al actualizar los valores actuales de los testimonios obtenidos de cadenas de referencia confiables. Después de una mala experiencia con otro agente, cada agente disminuye la calificación del agente malo y propaga esta mala experiencia en toda la red para que otros agentes puedan actualizar sus calificaciones en consecuencia. Este enfoque podría implementarse en nuestro dominio para permitir que los agentes de chismes identifiquen a los agentes interesados y, por lo tanto, minimicen su efecto. Sin embargo, la implementación de dicho mecanismo es una adición costosa a la infraestructura de agentes autónomos en las redes de transporte. Esto se debe principalmente a la naturaleza dinámica de la lista de vecinos en las redes de transporte. Por lo tanto, no solo requiere mantener la lista de vecinos, ya que los vecinos cambian con frecuencia, sino que también es más difícil construir un buen sistema de reputación. Leckie et al.[9] Centrarse en el tema de cuándo compartir información entre los agentes de la red. Su dominio implica monitorear sensores distribuidos. Cada agente monitorea un subconjunto de los sensores y evalúa una hipótesis basada en las mediciones locales de sus sensores. Si el agente cree que una hipótesis es suficiente, probablemente intercambie esta información con los otros agentes. En su dominio, el objetivo de todos los agentes es llegar a un consenso global sobre la probabilidad de la hipótesis. Sin embargo, en nuestro dominio, a medida que los agentes se mueven constantemente, tienen muchas muestras, que intercambian entre sí. Además, los datos también pueden variar (por ejemplo, un camino podría informarse como atascado, pero unos minutos más tarde podría ser gratuito), lo que dificulta decidir si confiar en el agente, quien envió los datos. Además, el agente podría estar solo sobre un subconjunto de sus muestras, lo que hace que sea aún más difícil detectar su trampa. Se han realizado algunos trabajos en el contexto de redes de chismes o redes de transporte con respecto a la propagación de datos y su difusión. Datta et al.[4] Centrarse en la difusión de información en redes ad-hoc móviles (MANET). Proponen un algoritmo de chismes autónomo para un entorno de redes ad-hoc móvil sin infraestructura. Su algoritmo de chismes autónomo utiliza un mecanismo codicioso para difundir elementos de datos en la red. Los elementos de datos se extienden a vecinos inmediatos que están interesados en la información y evitan los que no están interesados. La decisión de qué nodo está interesado en la información es tomada por el elemento de datos en sí, utilizando heurísticas. Sin embargo, su trabajo se concentra en el movimiento de los datos en sí, y no en los agentes que propagan los datos. Esto es diferente de nuestro escenario en el que cada agente mantiene los datos que ha recopilado, mientras que el agente en sí deambula por el camino y es responsable (y tiene las capacidades) para difundir los datos a otros agentes de la red. Das et al.[3] propone una estrategia cooperativa para la entrega de contenido en redes vehiculares. En su dominio, los compañeros descargan un archivo de una malla e intercambian piezas del archivo entre ellos. Nosotros, por otro lado, estamos interesados en las redes vehiculares en las que no existe una regla que obligue a los agentes a cooperar entre ellos. Shibata et al.[16] propone un método para que los automóviles recolecten estadísticas de atasco de tráfico de cooperación y autónoma para estimar el tiempo de llegada a los destinos para cada automóvil. La comunicación se basa en IEEE 802.11, sin usar una infraestructura fija en el suelo. Si bien usamos el mismo dominio, nos centramos en un problema diferente. Shibata et al.[16] Se centran principalmente en transmitir eficientemente los datos entre los agentes (por ejemplo, evitar duplicados y sobrecarga de comunicación), ya que nos centramos en el caso donde los agentes no son cooperativos en 328 el Sexto INTL. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) naturaleza, y sobre cómo los agentes egoístas afectan a otros agentes y la carga de la red. Wang et al.[17] También afirma, en el contexto de las redes inalámbricas, que los agentes individuales probablemente hagan lo más beneficioso para sus propietarios y actuarán egoístamente. Diseñan un protocolo para la comunicación en redes en las que todos los agentes son egoístas. Su protocolo motiva a cada agente a maximizar sus ganancias solo cuando se comporta con sinceridad (un mecanismo de compatibilidad con incentivos). Sin embargo, el dominio de las redes inalámbricas es bastante diferente del dominio de las redes de transporte. En la red inalámbrica, se requiere que el terminal inalámbrico contribuya con sus recursos locales a transmitir datos. Así, Wang et al.[17] use un mecanismo de pago, que adjunta costos a las terminales al transmitir datos y, por lo tanto, les permite maximizar su utilidad al transmitir datos, en lugar de actuar egoístamente. A diferencia de esto, en el contexto de las redes de transporte, la construcción de tal mecanismo no es una tarea directa, ya que los agentes interesados y los agentes de chismes regulares pueden incurrir en el mismo costo al transmitir datos. La diferencia entre los dos tipos de agentes solo existe con respecto a la credibilidad de los datos que intercambian. En la siguiente sección, describiremos nuestro modelo de red de transporte y chismes entre los agentes. También describiremos los diferentes agentes en nuestro sistema.3. Modelo y simulaciones Primero describimos el modelo de red de transporte formal, y luego describimos los diseños de simulaciones.3.1 Modelo formal después de Shavitt y Shay [15] y Parshani [13], la red de transporte está representada por un gráfico dirigido G (V, E), donde V es el conjunto de vértices que representan las uniones, y E es el conjunto de bordes,representando carreteras. Un borde e ∈ E está asociado con un peso w> 0, que especifica el tiempo que lleva atravesar el camino asociado con ese borde. Los pesos de las carreteras varían en el tiempo según la carga de la red (tráfico). Cada automóvil, que está asociado con un agente autónomo, recibe un par de puntos de origen y destino (vértices). Un viaje se define como la ruta (no necesariamente simple) tomada por un agente entre el vértice de origen y el vértice de destino. Suponemos que siempre hay una ruta entre una fuente y un destino. Una longitud de viaje se define como la suma de todos los pesos de los bordes que constituyen este camino. Cada agente tiene que viajar entre sus puntos de origen y destino y tiene como objetivo minimizar la duración de su viaje. Inicialmente, los agentes ignoran el estado de las carreteras. Los agentes regulares solo son capaces de recopilar información sobre las carreteras a medida que los atraviesan. Sin embargo, suponemos que algunos agentes tienen medios de comunicación entre vehículos (por ejemplo, IEEE 802.11) con un rango de comunicación dado, que les permite comunicarse con otros agentes con el mismo dispositivo. Esos agentes se denominan agentes de chismes. Dado que el rango de comunicación es limitado, el intercambio de información que usa chismes se realiza de una de dos maneras: (a) entre los agentes de chismes que se pasan entre sí, o (b) entre los agentes de chismes ubicados en la misma unión. Suponemos que cada agente almacena la información más reciente que ha recibido o reunido alrededor de los bordes de la red. Un subconjunto de los agentes de chismes son aquellos agentes que están interesados y manipulan los dispositivos para su propio beneficio. Nos referiremos a estos agentes como agentes egoístas. Una descripción detallada de su comportamiento se da en las Secciones 4 y 5. 3.2 Building de diseño de simulación en [13], la red de nuestras simulaciones replica una parte central de una ciudad grande, y consta de 50 cruces y 150 carreteras, que son aproximadamente lasNúmero de calles principales en la ciudad. Cada simulación consta de 6 iteraciones. La unidad de tiempo básica de la iteración es un paso, que equivalente a unos 30 segundos. Cada iteración simula seis horas de movimientos. El número promedio de automóviles que pasan por la red durante la iteración es de aproximadamente 70,000 y el número promedio de automóviles en la red en una unidad de tiempo específica es de aproximadamente 3,500 automóviles. En cada iteración, los mismos agentes se usan con el mismo origen y puntos de destino, mientras que los datos recopilados en iteraciones anteriores se conservan en las iteraciones futuras (denominadas historia del agente). Esto nos permite simular una rutina diaria en la red de transporte (por ejemplo, una semana laboral). Cada uno de los experimentos que describimos a continuación se ejecuta con 5 escenarios de tráfico diferentes. Cada uno de estos escenarios de tráfico difiere entre sí por la carga inicial de las carreteras y las rutas designadas de los agentes (automóviles) en la red. Para cada uno de estos escenarios, se ejecutan 5 simulaciones, creando un total de 25 simulaciones para cada experimento. Parshani et al.[13, 14] que la propagación de información en la red es muy eficiente cuando el porcentaje de agentes de chismes es del 10% o más. Sin embargo, debido a la congestión causada por demasiados autos que se apresuran a lo que se informa como la parte menos congestionada de la red, 20-30% de los agentes de chismes conducen a los resultados de enrutamiento más eficientes en sus experimentos. Por lo tanto, en nuestra simulación, nos enfocamos solo en simulaciones en las que el porcentaje de agentes de chismes es del 20%. Las simulaciones se realizaron con diferentes porcentajes de agentes egoístas. Para obtener significación estadística, ejecutamos cada simulación con cambios en el conjunto de agentes de chismes y el conjunto de los agentes interesados. Para obtener una escala ordinal similar, los resultados se normalizaron. Los valores normalizados se calcularon comparando cada resultado de cada agente con sus resultados cuando se ejecutó el mismo escenario sin agentes egoístas. Esto se hizo para todas las iteraciones. El uso de los valores normalizados nos permitió ver cuán peor (o mejor) funcionaría cada agente en comparación con la configuración básica. Por ejemplo, si una longitud de viaje promedio de un cierto agente en la iteración 1 sin agente autointerestado era de 50 años, y la longitud era 60 en el mismo escenario e iteración en los que estaban involucrados agentes interestonados, entonces el valor normalizado para ese agente lo haríaser 60/50 = 1.2. Más detalles sobre las simulaciones se describen en las Secciones 4 y 5. 4. Extendiendo mentiras, maximizando la utilidad en el primer conjunto de experimentos, investigamos los beneficios logrados por los agentes interesados, cuyo objetivo era minimizar su propia duración del viaje. Los agentes interesados adoptaron un enfoque de trampa, en el que enviaron datos falsos a sus compañeros. En esta sección describimos primero las simulaciones con los agentes interesados. Luego, modelamos el escenario como el sexto intl.

Calcule la ruta más corta desde el origen al destino.2. Comunique los siguientes datos a otros agentes: (a) Si el camino no está en la ruta de los agentes, envíe los datos verdaderos al respecto (por ejemplo, datos sobre las carreteras que ha recibido de otros agentes) (b) para todas las carreteras en la ruta de los agentes, que el agente aún no ha atravesado, envíe un alto peso al azar. Básicamente, el agente interesado actúa igual que el agente de chismes. Recopila datos sobre el peso de las carreteras (ya sea atravesando la carretera o obteniendo los datos de otros agentes) y envía los datos que ha recopilado a otros agentes. Sin embargo, el agente interesado en sí mismo actúa de manera diferente cuando el camino está en su ruta. Dado que el objetivo de los agentes es llegar a su destino lo más rápido posible, el agente informará falsamente que todas las carreteras en su ruta están muy congestionadas. Esto es para liberar el camino por sí mismo, haciendo que otros agentes vuelvan a calcular sus caminos, esta vez sin incluir caminos en la ruta de los agentes egoístas. Con este fin, para todas las carreteras en su ruta, que el agente aún no ha pasado, el agente genera un peso aleatorio, que está por encima del peso promedio de las carreteras en la red. Luego asocia estos nuevos pesos con las carreteras en su ruta y las envía a los otros agentes. Si bien un agente también puede desviar los autos de su ruta informando falsamente caminos congestionados en paralelo a su ruta como gratuito, este comportamiento no es muy probable ya que otros agentes, que intentan usar las carreteras, encontrarán el error en poco tiempo y difunden elverdadera congestión en el camino. Por otro lado, si un agente logra persuadir a otros agentes para que no usen una carretera, será más difícil para ellos detectar que dichas carreteras no estén congestionadas. Además, para evitar ser influenciado por sus propias mentiras y otras mentiras que se extienden en la red, todos los agentes interesados ignorarán los datos recibidos sobre las carreteras con tráfico pesado (tenga en cuenta que los datos sobre carreteras que no son en gran medida no se ignoran) 1. En la siguiente subsección describimos los resultados de la simulación, que involucran a los agentes interesados.4.2 Resultados de simulación Para probar los beneficios de hacer trampa por parte de los agentes interesados en sí mismo, realizamos varios experimentos. En el primer conjunto de experimentos, creamos un escenario, en el que un pequeño grupo de agentes interesados se propaga en la misma ruta y probamos su efecto en la longitud del viaje de todos los agentes de la red.1 En otras simulaciones que hemos ejecutado, en las que había habido varias congestiones reales en la red, de hecho vimos que incluso cuando las carreteras están atascadas, los agentes interesados se veían menos afectados si ignoraban todo el tráfico pesado, ya que por esteTambién descartaron todas las mentiras deambulando por la red Tabla 1: Valores de longitud de viaje normalizados, agentes interesados en ruta con la misma iteración de chismes egoístas - Gossip - Agentes de número regular SR Otros Agentes 1 1.38 1.27 1.06 1.06 2 0.95 1.56 1.18 1.14 3 1.00 1.86 1.28 1.28 1.281.17 4 1.06 2.93 1.35 1.16 5 1.13 2.00 1.40 1.17 6 1.08 2.02 1.43 1.18 Por lo tanto, varios autos, que tenían el mismo origen y puntos de destino, se designaron como agentes egoístas. En esta simulación, seleccionamos solo 6 agentes para formar parte del grupo de los agentes interesados, ya que queríamos investigar el efecto logrado por solo un pequeño número de agentes. En cada simulación en este experimento, se eligieron al azar 6 agentes diferentes para formar parte del grupo de agentes egoístas, como se describió anteriormente. Además, una carretera, en la ruta de estos agentes, fue seleccionada al azar para ser bloqueada parcialmente, dejando que solo un automóvil pase por ese camino en cada paso de tiempo. Alrededor de 8,000 agentes fueron seleccionados al azar como agentes de chismes regulares, y los otros 32,000 agentes fueron designados como agentes regulares. Analizamos la longitud promedio del viaje de los agentes interesados en sí mismo en comparación con la duración promedio del viaje de otros agentes de chismes regulares que viajan a lo largo de la misma ruta. La Tabla 1 resume los resultados normalizados para los agentes interesados en sí mismo, los agentes de chismes (aquellos que tienen el mismo origen y puntos de destino que los agentes interesados, denotaron chismes, y todos los demás agentes de chismes, denotaron chismes) y elAgentes regulares, en función del número de iteración. Podemos ver por los resultados que la primera vez que los agentes interesados en sí mismos viajaron por la ruta mientras difundieron los datos falsos sobre las carreteras no los ayudaron (usando la prueba t pareada, mostramos que esos agentes tenían longitudes de viaje significativamente más bajas en el escenario en el queNo difundieron ninguna mentira, con P <0.01). Esto se debe principalmente al hecho de que las mentiras no pasan por alto al agente interesado y alcanzan otros autos que están por delante del automóvil interesado en la misma ruta. Por lo tanto, la difusión de las mentiras en la primera iteración no ayuda al agente interesado a sí mismo a liberar la ruta que está a punto de viajar, en la primera iteración. Solo cuando los agentes interesados en sí mismos habían repetido su viaje en la siguiente iteración (iteración 2), les ayudó significativamente (P = 0.04). La razón de esto es que otros agentes de chismes recibieron estos datos y los usaron para recalcular su camino más corto, evitando así la entrada a las carreteras, para las cuales los agentes interesados habían difundido información falsa sobre la congestión. También es interesante observar el gran valor alcanzado por los agentes interesados en la primera iteración. Esto se debe principalmente a varios agentes interesados en sí mismo, que ingresaron a la carretera atascada. Esta situación ocurrió ya que los agentes interesados ignoraron todos los datos de tráfico pesado y, por lo tanto, ignoraron el hecho de que el camino estaba atascado. Cuando comenzaron a difundir mentiras sobre este camino, más autos se desplazaron de esta ruta, lo que liberó la carretera para las futuras iteraciones. Sin embargo, también recordamos que los agentes interesados ignoran toda la información sobre las carreteras de tráfico pesado. Por lo tanto, 330 el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Tabla 2: Valores de longitud de viaje normalizados, la propagación se encuentra para un agente beneficiario iteración Beneficiario de chismes - Gossip - Agente de número normal SR Otros Agentes 1 1.10 1.05 0.94 1.11 2 1.09 1.14 0.99 1.14 3 1.041.19 1.02 1.14 4 1.03 1.26 1.03 1.14 5 1.05 1.32 1.05 1.12 6 0.92 1.40 1.06 1.11 Cuando la red se congestiona, los autos más egoístas se ven afectados, ya que podrían ingresar a las carreteras Jammed, que de otra manera no habrían ingresado. Esto se puede ver, por ejemplo, en iteraciones 4-6, en la que el valor normalizado de los agentes interesados aumentó por encima de 1.00. Usando la prueba t emparejada para comparar estos valores con los valores logrados por estos agentes cuando no se usan mentiras, vemos que no hay diferencias significativas entre los dos escenarios. A diferencia de los agentes de chismes, podemos ver cuán poco efecto tienen los agentes interesados en los agentes regulares. En comparación con los agentes de chismes en la misma ruta que han viajado tanto como 193% más, cuando se introducen agentes egoístas, la duración del viaje promedio para los agentes regulares solo ha aumentado en aproximadamente un 15%. Este resultado es incluso más bajo que el efecto en otros agentes de chismes en toda la red. Dado que notamos que hacer trampa por los agentes interesados no los beneficia en la primera iteración, ideamos otro conjunto de experimentos. En el segundo conjunto de experimentos, los agentes interesados tienen el objetivo de ayudar a otro agente, que se supone que debe ingresar a la red algún tiempo después de que ingresó el agente egoísta. Nos referimos al último agente como el agente beneficiario. Al igual que un agente interesado, el agente beneficiario también ignora todos los datos sobre el tráfico pesado. En la vida real, esto puede ser modelado, por ejemplo, por un esposo, que le gustaría ayudar a su esposa a encontrar una ruta más rápida hacia su destino. La Tabla 2 resume los valores normalizados para los diferentes agentes. Como en el primer conjunto de experimentos, se ejecutaron 5 simulaciones para cada escenario, con un total de 25 simulaciones. En cada una de estas simulaciones, un agente se seleccionó al azar como agente egoísta, y luego otro agente, con el mismo origen que el agente autoinalerado, se seleccionó al azar como agente beneficiario. Los otros 8,000 y 32,000 agentes fueron designados como agentes de chismes y agentes regulares, respectivamente. Podemos ver que a medida que avanza el número de iteraciones, cuanto menor sea el valor normalizado para el agente beneficiario. En este escenario, al igual que el anterior, en las primeras iteraciones, el agente beneficiario no solo evita las carreteras atascadas, ya que ignora todo el tráfico pesado, tampoco se beneficia de las mentiras extendidas por el agente egoísta. Esto se debe al hecho de que las mentiras aún no están incorporadas por otros agentes de chismes. Por lo tanto, si comparamos la longitud promedio del viaje en la primera iteración cuando las mentiras se extienden y cuando no hay mentiras, el promedio es significativamente más bajo cuando no hay mentiras (p <0.03). Por otro lado, si comparamos la longitud promedio del viaje en todas las iteraciones, no hay diferencias significativas entre las dos configuraciones. Aún así, en la mayoría de las iteraciones, la longitud promedio del viaje del agente beneficiario es más larga que en el caso cuando no se extienden mentiras. También podemos ver el impacto en los otros agentes del sistema. Si bien los agentes de chismes, que no están en la ruta del agente beneficiario, prácticamente no se ven afectados por el agente egoísta, los que están en la ruta y los agentes regulares se ven afectados y tienen valores normalizados más altos. Es decir, incluso con solo un automóvil interestado, podemos ver que tanto los agentes de chismes que siguen la misma ruta que las mentiras propagadas por los agentes interesados y otros agentes regulares, aumentan su duración de su viaje en más del 14%. En nuestro tercer conjunto de experimentos, examinamos un entorno en el que había un número creciente de agentes, y los agentes no necesariamente tenían el mismo punto de origen y destino. Para modelar esto, seleccionamos al azar agentes autointerestos, cuyo objetivo era minimizar su duración promedio del viaje, suponiendo que los autos estuvieran repitiendo sus viajes (es decir, más de una iteración se realizó). A diferencia del primer conjunto de experimentos, en este conjunto, los agentes interesados se seleccionaron al azar, y no imponemos la restricción de que todos tendrán los mismos puntos de origen y destino. Como en los conjuntos anteriores de experimentos, ejecutamos 5 simulaciones diferentes por escenario. En cada simulación se realizaron 11 ejecuciones, cada una de las cuales se ejecutan con diferentes números de agentes egoístas: 0 (sin agentes egoístas), 1, 2, 4, 8 y 16. Cada agente adoptó el comportamiento modelado en la Sección 4.1. La Figura 1 muestra el valor normalizado alcanzado por los agentes egoístas en función de su número. La figura muestra estos valores para las iteraciones 2-6. La primera iteración no se muestra intencionalmente, ya que asumimos viajes repetidos. Además, hemos visto en el conjunto anterior de experimentos y hemos proporcionado explicaciones por qué los agentes interesados no ganan mucho de su comportamiento en la primera iteración.0.955 0.96 0.965 0.97 0.975 0.98 0.985 0.99 0.995 1 1.005 1.01 1.015 1.02 1.025 1.03 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 8 9 101112113141516 Número de agentes autointerestadosValores normalizados en función del número de agentes egoístas. Usando estas simulaciones, examinamos cuál podría ser el umbral para el número de agentes interestimales seleccionados al azar para permitirse beneficiarse de su comportamiento egoísta. Podemos ver que hasta 8 agentes egoístas, el valor normalizado promedio es inferior a 1. Es decir, se benefician de su comportamiento malicioso. En el caso de un agente interesado, hay una diferencia significativa entre la longitud promedio del viaje de cuándo se extiende el agente y cuando no se extienden mentiras (p <0.001), mientras que cuando el sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y los sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 331 hay 2, 4, 8 y 16 agentes egoístas no hay diferencia de importancia. Sin embargo, a medida que aumenta el número de agentes interesados en sí mismo, el valor normalizado también aumenta. En tales casos, el valor normalizado es mayor que 1, y la longitud del viaje de los agentes egoístas se vuelve significativamente más alto que la longitud de su viaje, en los casos en que no hay agentes interesados en el sistema. En la siguiente subsección analizamos el escenario como un juego y mostramos que cuando en equilibrio el intercambio de chismes entre los agentes se vuelve ineficiente.4.3 Cuando el chismoso es ineficiente, continuamos y modelamos nuestro escenario como un juego, para encontrar el equilibrio. Hay dos tipos posibles para los agentes: (a) agentes de chismes regulares y (b) agentes egoístas. Cada uno de estos agentes es un representante de su grupo y, por lo tanto, todos los agentes en el mismo grupo tienen un comportamiento similar. Observamos que la ventaja de usar chismes en las redes de transporte es permitir que los agentes detecten anomalías en la red (por ejemplo, atascos de tráfico) y se adaptaran rápidamente a ellos recalculando sus rutas [14]. También suponemos que el objetivo de los agentes interesados es minimizar su propia longitud de viaje, por lo tanto, difunden mentiras en sus rutas, como se describe en la Sección 4.1. También suponemos que no se utilizan métodos sofisticados para identificar a los agentes interesados o manejar la reputación. Esto se debe principalmente a la complejidad de incorporar y mantener tales mecanismos, así como a la dinámica de la red, en la que las interacciones entre diferentes agentes son frecuentes, los agentes pueden abandonar la red y los datos sobre el camino pueden cambiar a medida que avanza el tiempo(Por ejemplo, un agente de chismes regular podría informar un camino como gratis en un momento dado, pero actualmente puede atascarse debido al tráfico pesado en la carretera). Deje que TAVG sea el tiempo promedio que lleva atravesar una ventaja en la red de transporte (es decir, la carga promedio de un borde). Deje que Tmax sea el tiempo máximo que se necesita para atravesar un borde. Investigaremos el juego, en el que los agentes de chismes egoístas y interesados pueden elegir las siguientes acciones. Los agentes interesados en sí mismos pueden elegir cuánto mentir, es decir, pueden optar por extender cuánto tiempo (no necesariamente la verdadera duración) se necesita para atravesar ciertas carreteras. Dado que el objetivo de los agentes interesados es difundir mensajes como si algunos caminos estuvieran atascados, el tiempo de recorrido que informan es obviamente mayor que el tiempo promedio. Denotamos el tiempo en que los agentes interesados se propagan como TS, de modo que TAVG ≤ TS ≤ Tmax. Motivado por los resultados de las simulaciones que hemos descrito anteriormente, vimos que los agentes están menos afectados si descartan los valores de tráfico pesado. Por lo tanto, los autos de chismes regulares, que intentan mitigar el efecto de los mentirosos, pueden elegir una estrategia para ignorar los valores de congestión anormales por encima de cierto umbral, TG. Obviamente, tavg ≤ tg ≤ tmax. Para evitar que los agentes de chismes detecten las mentiras y simplemente descarten esos valores, los agentes interesados envían mentiras en un rango dado, [TS, Tmax], con una distribución geométrica inversa, es decir, cuanto mayor sea el valor t,Cuanto mayor sea su frecuencia. Ahora construimos las funciones de utilidad para cada tipo de agentes, que se define por los valores de TS y TG. Si los agentes interesados en sí mismos difundieron los tiempos de recorrido más altos o iguales al umbral regular de los autos de chismes, no se beneficiarán de esas mentiras. Por lo tanto, el valor de utilidad de los agentes interesados en este caso es 0. Por otro lado, si los agentes interesados en sí mismos difunden el tiempo de recorrido que es más bajo que el umbral, obtendrán un valor de utilidad positivo. Desde el punto de vista de los agentes de chismes regulares, si aceptan mensajes de los agentes interestimales, entonces incorporan las mentiras en su cálculo, por lo que perderán puntos de utilidad. Por otro lado, si descartan los valores falsos que envían los agentes egoístas, es decir, no incorporan las mentiras, obtendrán valores de utilidad. Formalmente, nos usamos para denotar la utilidad de los agentes interesados y UG para denotar la utilidad de los agentes de chismes regulares. También denotamos el perfil de estrategia en el juego como {TS, TG}. Las funciones de utilidad se definen como: us = 0 si ts ≥ tg ts - tavg + 1 si ts <tg (1) ug = tg - tavg si ts ≥ tg ts - tg si ts <tg (2) estamos interesados en encontrarEl equilibrio de Nash. Recordamos de [12], que el equilibrio de Nash es un perfil de estrategia, donde ningún jugador tiene nada que ganar al desviarse de su estrategia, dado que el otro agente sigue su perfil de estrategia. Formalmente, deje que (S, U) denote el juego, donde S es el conjunto de perfiles de estrategia y U es el conjunto de funciones de utilidad. Cuando cada agente i ∈ {chismes regulares, egoísta} elige una estrategia TI que resulta en un perfil de estrategia t = (ts, tg) y luego el agente i obtiene una utilidad de ui (t). Un perfil de estrategia t ∗ ∈ S es un equilibrio de Nash si no es rentable la desviación en la estrategia por un solo agente, es decir, si para todos los i, ui (t ∗) ≥ ui (ti, t ∗ −i). Es decir, (TS, TG) es un equilibrio de Nash si los agentes interesados en sí mismos no tienen otro valor TS tal que nosotros (TS, TG)> US (TS, TG), y de manera similar para los agentes de chismes. Ahora tenemos el siguiente teorema. Teorema 4.1.(TAVG, TAVG) es el único equilibrio de Nash. Prueba. Primero mostraremos que (TAVG, TAVG) es un equilibrio de Nash. Suponga, por contradicción, que los agentes de chismes eligen otro valor tg> tavg. Así, ug (tavg, tg) = tavg - tg <0. Por otro lado, UG (Tavg, Tavg) = 0. Por lo tanto, los agentes de chismes regulares no tienen incentivos para desviarse de esta estrategia. Los agentes interesados tampoco tienen ningún incentivo para desviarse de esta estrategia. Por contradicción, nuevamente suponga que los agentes interesados en sí mismos eligen otro valor ts> tavg. Esto, es (ts, tavg) = 0, mientras que nosotros (tavg, tavg) = 0. Ahora mostraremos que la solución anterior es única. Mostraremos que cualquier otra tupla (TS, TG), de modo que Tavg <Tg ≤ Tmax y Tavg <TS ≤ Tmax no es un equilibrio NASH. Tenemos tres casos. En el primer tavg <tg <ts ≤ tmax. Esto, es (ts, tg) = 0 y ug (ts, tg) = tg - tg. En este caso, los agentes de chismes regulares tienen un incentivo para desviarse y elegir otra estrategia TG + 1, ya que al hacerlo aumentan su propia utilidad: UG (TS, TG + 1) = TG + 1 - TAVG. En el segundo caso tenemos tavg <ts <tg ≤ tmax. Por lo tanto, ug (ts, tg) = ts - tg <0. Además, los agentes de chismes regulares tienen un incentivo para desviarse y elegir otra estrategia TG −1, en la que su valor de utilidad es mayor: UG (TS, Tg −1) = TS - Tg + 1. En el último caso tenemos tavg <ts = tg ≤ tmax. Esto, es (ts, tg) = ts - tg = 0. En este caso, los agentes interesados tienen un incentivo para desviarse y elegir otra estrategia TG-1, en la que su valor de utilidad es más alto: US (Tg-1, Tg) = Tg-1-Tavg + 1 = Tg-Tavg> 0. 332 El sexto intl.

Por lo tanto, para este punto de equilibrio, el intercambio de información de chismes entre los agentes es ineficiente, ya que los agentes de chismes no pueden detectar ninguna anomalía en la red. En la siguiente sección describimos otro escenario para los agentes interesados en sí mismo, en el que no les preocupa su propia utilidad, sino que interesan en maximizar la duración del viaje promedio de otros agentes de chismes.5. La propagación de mentiras, causando el caos, otro posible comportamiento que puede ser adoptado por los agentes autointerestos se caracteriza por su objetivo de causar desorden en la red. Esto se puede lograr, por ejemplo, maximizando la longitud promedio del viaje de todos los agentes, incluso a costa de maximizar su propia duración del viaje. Para comprender la vulnerabilidad del sistema de soporte de transporte basado en chismes, ejecutamos 5 simulaciones diferentes para cada escenario. En cada simulación, se eligieron al azar diferentes agentes (usando una distribución uniforme) para actuar como agentes de chismes, entre ellos se eligieron agentes egoístas. Cada agente interesado se comportó de la misma manera que se describe en la Sección 4.1. Cada simulación consistió en 11 ejecuciones con cada ejecución que comprenden diferentes números de agentes egoístas: 0 (sin agentes interesados), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 50, 64, 80 y 100. Además, en cada ejecución, el número de agentes interesados se incrementó incrementalmente. Por ejemplo: la ejecución con 50 agentes interesados en sí mismo consistió en todos los agentes egoístas que se usaron en la ejecución con 32 agentes interesados en sí mismos, pero con 18 agentes autoinestionados adicionales. Las tablas 3 y 4 resumen la longitud de viaje normalizada para los agentes interesados en sí mismos, los agentes de chismes regulares y los agentes regulares (sin goss). La Tabla 3 resume los datos para la primera iteración y la Tabla 4 resume los datos para el promedio de todas las iteraciones. La Figura 2 demuestra los cambios en los valores normalizados para los agentes de chismes regulares y los agentes regulares, en función del número de iteración. Similar a los resultados en nuestro primer conjunto de experimentos, descritos en la Sección 4.2, podemos ver que los agentes egoístas seleccionados al azar que siguen diferentes rutas seleccionadas al azar no se benefician de su comportamiento malicioso (es decir, su longitud promedio de viaje no disminuye). Sin embargo, cuando solo hay un agente interesado en sí mismo, se beneficia del comportamiento malicioso, incluso en la primera iteración. Los resultados también indican que los agentes de chismes regulares son más sensibles al comportamiento malicioso que los agentes regulares, la duración promedio del viaje para los agentes de chismes aumenta significativamente (por ejemplo, con 32 agentes interestonados de la duración del viaje promedio para los agentes de chismes fue 146% más alta que en enEl escenario sin agentes interesados en absoluto, en lugar de un aumento de solo el 25% para los agentes regulares). En contraste, estos resultados también indican que los agentes interesados en sí mismos no logran causar una carga significativa en la red por su comportamiento malicioso.1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 1 2 3 4 5 Número de iteración Valor normalizado 32 Agentes egoístas, agentes de chismes Valor normalizado 100 Agentes egoístas, agentes de chismes Valor normalizado 32Agentes egoístas, agentes regulares normalizados valor 100 agentes egoístas, agentes regulares normalizados Valor Figura 2: chismes y agentes regulares normalizaron valores, en función de la iteración. Dado que el objetivo de los agentes interesados en este caso es causar desorden en la red en lugar de usar las mentiras para sus propios beneficios, surge la pregunta de por qué el comportamiento de los agentes interesados sería enviar mentiras sobre sus mentirasrutas solamente. Además, planteamos la hipótesis de que si todos envían mentiras sobre las mismas carreteras importantes, el daño que podrían infligir en toda la red sería mayor que cada uno de ellos hubiera enviado mentiras sobre su propia ruta. Para examinar esta hipótesis, diseñamos otro conjunto de experimentos. En este conjunto de experimentos, todos los agentes interesados se extienden sobre las mismas 13 carreteras principales en la red. Sin embargo, los resultados muestran un impacto bastante menor en otros chismes y Reguthe Sixth INTL.

El valor normalizado promedio para los agentes de chismes en estas simulaciones fue solo de aproximadamente 1.07, en lugar de 1.7 en el escenario original. Al analizar los resultados, vimos que, aunque los datos falsos se extendieron, no hizo que otros autos de chismes cambiaran su ruta. La razón principal fue que las mentiras se extendieron en las carreteras que no estaban en la ruta de los agentes interesados. Por lo tanto, los datos tardaron más en llegar a los agentes en las carreteras principales, y cuando los agentes llegaron a las carreteras relevantes, estos datos eran demasiado viejos para ser incorporados en los cálculos de los otros agentes. También examinamos el impacto de enviar mentiras para causar el caos cuando ya hay congestiones en la red. Con este fin, simulamos una red en la que se atascan 13 caminos principales. El comportamiento de los agentes interesados es como se describe en la Sección 4.1, y los agentes interesados propagados por su propia ruta. Los resultados de la simulación, detallados en la Tabla 5, muestran que existe un mayor incentivo para que los agentes interesados engañen cuando la red ya está congestionada, ya que su engaño causa más daño a los otros agentes de la red. Por ejemplo, mientras que la duración promedio del viaje de los agentes regulares aumentó solo en aproximadamente un 15% en el escenario original, en el que la red no estaba congestionada, en este escenario la duración promedio del viaje de los agentes había aumentado en aproximadamente un 60%.6. Conclusiones En este documento investigamos los beneficios logrados por los agentes interesados en redes vehiculares. Usando simulaciones investigamos dos comportamientos que podrían ser tomados por agentes egoístas: (a) tratar de minimizar la longitud de su viaje y (b) tratar de causar caos en la red. Nuestras simulaciones indican que en ambos comportamientos, los agentes autointerestos solo tienen un éxito limitado para lograr su objetivo, incluso si no se toman contramedidas. Esto contrasta con el mayor impacto infligido por los agentes egoístas en otros dominios (por ejemplo, comercio electrónico). Algunas razones para esto son las características especiales de las redes vehiculares y su naturaleza dinámica. Mientras que los agentes interesados propagan mentiras, no pueden elegir qué agentes con quienes interactuarán. Además, para cuando sus mentiras lleguen a otros agentes, pueden volverse irrelevantes, ya que los datos más recientes han alcanzado a los mismos agentes. Motivada por los resultados de la simulación, la investigación futura en este campo se centrará en modelar diferentes comportamientos de los agentes egoístas, lo que podría causar más daño a la red. Otra dirección de investigación sería encontrar formas de minimizar el efecto de los agentes egoístas mediante el uso de la reputación distribuida u otras medidas.7. Referencias [1] A. Bejan y R.

        "On the Benefits of Cheating by Self-Interested Agents in Vehicular Networks∗ Raz Lin and Sarit Kraus Computer Science Department Bar-Ilan University Ramat-Gan, Israel {linraz,sarit}@cs.biu.ac.il Yuval Shavitt School of Electrical Engineering Tel-Aviv University, Israel shavitt@eng.tau.ac.il ABSTRACT As more and more cars are equipped with GPS and Wi-Fi transmitters, it becomes easier to design systems that will allow cars to interact autonomously with each other, e.g., regarding traffic on the roads.",
        "Indeed, car manufacturers are already equipping their cars with such devices.",
        "Though, currently these systems are a proprietary, we envision a natural evolution where agent applications will be developed for vehicular systems, e.g., to improve car routing in dense urban areas.",
        "Nonetheless, this new technology and agent applications may lead to the emergence of self-interested car owners, who will care more about their own welfare than the social welfare of their peers.",
        "These car owners will try to manipulate their agents such that they transmit false data to their peers.",
        "Using a simulation environment, which models a real transportation network in a large city, we demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents if no counter-measures are implemented.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Intelligent agents General Terms Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION As technology advances, more and more cars are being equipped with devices, which enable them to act as autonomous agents.",
        "An important advancement in this respect is the introduction of ad-hoc communication networks (such as Wi-Fi), which enable the exchange of information between cars, e.g., for locating road congestions [1] and optimal routes [15] or improving traffic safety [2].",
        "Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) communication is already onboard by some car manufactures, enabling the collaboration between different cars on the road.",
        "For example, GMs proprietary algorithm [6], called the threat assessment algorithm, constantly calculates, in real time, other vehicles positions and speeds, and enables messaging other cars when a collision is imminent; Also, Honda has began testing its system in which vehicles talk with each other and with the highway system itself [7].",
        "In this paper, we investigate the attraction of being a selfish agent in vehicular networks.",
        "That is, we investigate the benefits achieved by car owners, who tamper with on-board devices and incorporate their own self-interested agents in them, which act for their benefit.",
        "We build on the notion of Gossip Networks, introduced by Shavitt and Shay [15], in which the agents can obtain road congestion information by gossiping with peer agents using ad-hoc communication.",
        "We recognize two typical behaviors that the self-interested agents could embark upon, in the context of vehicular networks.",
        "In the first behavior, described in Section 4, the objective of the self-interested agents is to maximize their own utility, expressed by their average journey duration on the road.",
        "This situation can be modeled in real life by car owners, whose aim is to reach their destination as fast as possible, and would like to have their way free of other cars.",
        "To this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents, by injecting false information into the network.",
        "This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route to other agents in the network in the hope of making the other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing them to choose a different route.",
        "The second type of behavior, described in Section 5, is modeled by the self-interested agents objective to cause disorder in the network, more than they are interested in maximizing their own utility.",
        "This kind of behavior could be generated, for example, by vandalism or terrorists, who aim to cause as much mayhem in the network as possible.",
        "We note that the introduction of self-interested agents to the network, would most probably motivate other agents to try and detect these agents in order to minimize their effect.",
        "This is similar, though in a different context, to the problem introduced by Lamport et al. [8] as the Byzantine Generals Problem.",
        "However, the introduction of mechanisms to deal with self-interested agents is costly and time consuming.",
        "In this paper we focus mainly on the attractiveness of selfish behavior by these agents, while we also provide some insights 327 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS into the possibility of detecting self-interested agents and minimizing their effect.",
        "To demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents, we have used a simulation environment, which models the transportation network in a central part of a large real city.",
        "The simulation environment is further described in Section 3.",
        "Our simulations provide insights to the benefits of self-interested agents cheating.",
        "Our findings can motivate future research in this field in order to minimize the effect of selfish-agents.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review related work in the field of self-interested agents and V2V communications.",
        "We continue and formally describe our environment and simulation settings in Section 3.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 describe the different behaviors of the selfinterested agents and our findings.",
        "Finally, we conclude the paper with open questions and future research directions. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK In their seminal paper, Lamport et al. [8] describe the Byzantine Generals problem, in which processors need to handle malfunctioning components that give conflicting information to different parts of the system.",
        "They also present a model in which not all agents are connected, and thus an agent cannot send a message to all the other agents.",
        "Dolev et al. [5] has built on this problem and has analyzed the number of faulty agents that can be tolerated in order to eventually reach the right conclusion about true data.",
        "Similar work is presented by Minsky et al. [11], who discuss techniques for constructing gossip protocols that are resilient to up to t malicious host failures.",
        "As opposed to the above works, our work focuses on vehicular networks, in which the agents are constantly roaming the network and exchanging data.",
        "Also, the domain of transportation networks introduces dynamic data, as the load of the roads is subject to change.",
        "In addition, the system in transportation networks has a feedback mechanism, since the load in the roads depends on the reports and the movement of the agents themselves.",
        "Malkhi et al. [10] present a gossip algorithm for propagating information in a network of processors, in the presence of malicious parties.",
        "Their algorithm prevents the spreading of spurious gossip and diffuses genuine data.",
        "This is done in time, which is logarithmic in the number of processes and linear in the number of corrupt parties.",
        "Nevertheless, their work assumes that the network is static and also that the agents are static (they discuss a network of processors).",
        "This is not true for transportation networks.",
        "For example, in our model, agents might gossip about heavy traffic load of a specific road, which is currently jammed, yet this information might be false several minutes later, leaving the agents to speculate whether the spreading agents are indeed malicious or not.",
        "In addition, as the agents are constantly moving, each agent cannot choose with whom he interacts and exchanges data.",
        "In the context of analyzing the data and deciding whether the data is true or not, researchers have focused on distributed reputation systems or decision mechanisms to decide whether or not to share data.",
        "Yu and Singh [18] build a social network of agents reputations.",
        "Every agent keeps a list of its neighbors, which can be changed over time, and computes the trustworthiness of other agents by updating the current values of testimonies obtained from reliable referral chains.",
        "After a bad experience with another agent every agent decreases the rating of the bad agent and propagates this bad experience throughout the network so that other agents can update their ratings accordingly.",
        "This approach might be implemented in our domain to allow gossip agents to identify self-interested agents and thus minimize their effect.",
        "However, the implementation of such a mechanism is an expensive addition to the infrastructure of autonomous agents in transportation networks.",
        "This is mainly due to the dynamic nature of the list of neighbors in transportation networks.",
        "Thus, not only does it require maintaining the neighbors list, since the neighbors change frequently, but it is also harder to build a good reputation system.",
        "Leckie et al. [9] focus on the issue of when to share information between the agents in the network.",
        "Their domain involves monitoring distributed sensors.",
        "Each agent monitors a subset of the sensors and evaluates a hypothesis based on the local measurements of its sensors.",
        "If the agent believes that a hypothesis is sufficient likely he exchanges this information with the other agents.",
        "In their domain, the goal of all the agents is to reach a global consensus about the likelihood of the hypothesis.",
        "In our domain, however, as the agents constantly move, they have many samples, which they exchange with each other.",
        "Also, the data might also vary (e.g., a road might be reported as jammed, but a few minutes later it could be free), thus making it harder to decide whether to trust the agent, who sent the data.",
        "Moreover, the agent might lie only about a subset of its samples, thus making it even harder to detect his cheating.",
        "Some work has been done in the context of gossip networks or transportation networks regarding the spreading of data and its dissemination.",
        "Datta et al. [4] focus on information dissemination in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET).",
        "They propose an autonomous gossiping algorithm for an infrastructure-less mobile ad-hoc networking environment.",
        "Their autonomous gossiping algorithm uses a greedy mechanism to spread data items in the network.",
        "The data items are spread to immediate neighbors that are interested in the information, and avoid ones that are not interested.",
        "The decision which node is interested in the information is made by the data item itself, using heuristics.",
        "However, their work concentrates on the movement of the data itself, and not on the agents who propagate the data.",
        "This is different from our scenario in which each agent maintains the data it has gathered, while the agent itself roams the road and is responsible (and has the capabilities) for spreading the data to other agents in the network.",
        "Das et al. [3] propose a cooperative strategy for content delivery in vehicular networks.",
        "In their domain, peers download a file from a mesh and exchange pieces of the file among themselves.",
        "We, on the other hand, are interested in vehicular networks in which there is no rule forcing the agents to cooperate among themselves.",
        "Shibata et al. [16] propose a method for cars to cooperatively and autonomously collect traffic jam statistics to estimate arrival time to destinations for each car.",
        "The communication is based on IEEE 802.11, without using a fixed infrastructure on the ground.",
        "While we use the same domain, we focus on a different problem.",
        "Shibata et al. [16] mainly focus on efficiently broadcasting the data between agents (e.g., avoid duplicates and communication overhead), as we focus on the case where agents are not cooperative in 328 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) nature, and on how selfish agents affect other agents and the network load.",
        "Wang et al. [17] also assert, in the context of wireless networks, that individual agents are likely to do what is most beneficial for their owners, and will act selfishly.",
        "They design a protocol for communication in networks in which all agents are selfish.",
        "Their protocol motivates every agent to maximize its profit only when it behaves truthfully (a mechanism of incentive compatibility).",
        "However, the domain of wireless networks is quite different from the domain of transportation networks.",
        "In the wireless network, the wireless terminal is required to contribute its local resources to transmit data.",
        "Thus, Wang et al. [17] use a payment mechanism, which attaches costs to terminals when transmitting data, and thus enables them to maximize their utility when transmitting data, instead of acting selfishly.",
        "Unlike this, in the context of transportation networks, constructing such a mechanism is not quite a straightforward task, as self-interested agents and regular gossip agents might incur the same cost when transmitting data.",
        "The difference between the two types of agents only exists regarding the credibility of the data they exchange.",
        "In the next section, we will describe our transportation network model and gossiping between the agents.",
        "We will also describe the different agents in our system. 3.",
        "MODEL AND SIMULATIONS We first describe the formal transportation network model, and then we describe the simulations designs. 3.1 Formal Model Following Shavitt and Shay [15] and Parshani [13], the transportation network is represented by a directed graph G(V, E), where V is the set of vertices representing junctions, and E is the set of edges, representing roads.",
        "An edge e ∈ E is associated with a weight w > 0, which specifies the time it takes to traverse the road associated with that edge.",
        "The roads weights vary in time according to the network (traffic) load.",
        "Each car, which is associated with an autonomous agent, is given a pair of origin and destination points (vertices).",
        "A journey is defined as the (not necessarily simple) path taken by an agent between the origin vertex and the destination vertex.",
        "We assume that there is always a path between a source and a destination.",
        "A journey length is defined as the sum of all weights of the edges constituting this path.",
        "Every agent has to travel between its origin and destination points and aims to minimize its journey length.",
        "Initially, agents are ignorant about the state of the roads.",
        "Regular agents are only capable of gathering information about the roads as they traverse them.",
        "However, we assume that some agents have means of inter-vehicle communication (e.g., IEEE 802.11) with a given communication range, which enables them to communicate with other agents with the same device.",
        "Those agents are referred to as gossip agents.",
        "Since the communication range is limited, the exchange of information using gossiping is done in one of two ways: (a) between gossip agents passing one another, or (b) between gossip agents located at the same junction.",
        "We assume that each agent stores the most recent information it has received or gathered around the edges in the network.",
        "A subset of the gossip agents are those agents who are selfinterested and manipulate the devices for their own benefit.",
        "We will refer to these agents as self-interested agents.",
        "A detailed description of their behavior is given in Sections 4 and 5. 3.2 Simulation Design Building on [13], the network in our simulations replicates a central part of a large city, and consists of 50 junctions and 150 roads, which are approximately the number of main streets in the city.",
        "Each simulation consists of 6 iterations.",
        "The basic time unit of the iteration is a step, which equivalents to about 30 seconds.",
        "Each iteration simulates six hours of movements.",
        "The average number of cars passing through the network during the iteration is about 70,000 and the average number of cars in the network at a specific time unit is about 3,500 cars.",
        "In each iteration the same agents are used with the same origin and destination points, whereas the data collected in earlier iterations is preserved in the future iterations (referred to as the history of the agent).",
        "This allows us to simulate somewhat a daily routine in the transportation network (e.g., a working week).",
        "Each of the experiments that we describe below is run with 5 different traffic scenarios.",
        "Each such traffic scenario differs from one another by the initial load of the roads and the designated routes of the agents (cars) in the network.",
        "For each such scenario 5 simulations are run, creating a total of 25 simulations for each experiment.",
        "It has been shown by Parshani et al. [13, 14] that the information propagation in the network is very efficient when the percentage of gossiping agents is 10% or more.",
        "Yet, due to congestion caused by too many cars rushing to what is reported as the less congested part of the network 20-30% of gossiping agents leads to the most efficient routing results in their experiments.",
        "Thus, in our simulation, we focus only on simulations in which the percentage of gossip agents is 20%.",
        "The simulations were done with different percentages of self-interested agents.",
        "To gain statistical significance we ran each simulation with changes in the set of the gossip agents, and the set of the self-interested agents.",
        "In order to gain a similar ordinal scale, the results were normalized.",
        "The normalized values were calculated by comparing each agents result to his results when the same scenario was run with no self-interested agents.",
        "This was done for all of the iterations.",
        "Using the normalized values enabled us to see how worse (or better) each agent would perform compared to the basic setting.",
        "For example, if an average journey length of a certain agent in iteration 1 with no selfinterested agent was 50, and the length was 60 in the same scenario and iteration in which self-interested agents were involved, then the normalized value for that agent would be 60/50 = 1.2.",
        "More details regarding the simulations are described in Sections 4 and 5. 4.",
        "SPREADING LIES, MAXIMIZING UTILITY In the first set of experiments we investigated the benefits achieved by the self-interested agents, whose aim was to minimize their own journey length.",
        "The self-interested agents adopted a cheating approach, in which they sent false data to their peers.",
        "In this section we first describe the simulations with the self-interested agents.",
        "Then, we model the scenario as a The Sixth Intl.",

        "Calculate the shortest path from origin to destination. 2.",
        "Communicate the following data to other agents: (a) If the road is not in the agents route - send the true data about it (e.g., data about roads it has received from other agents) (b) For all roads in the agents route, which the agent has not yet traversed, send a random high weight.",
        "Basically, the self-interested agent acts the same as the gossip agent.",
        "It collects data regarding the weight of the roads (either by traversing the road or by getting the data from other agents) and sends the data it has collected to other agents.",
        "However, the self-interested agent acts differently when the road is in its route.",
        "Since the agents goal is to reach its destination as fast as possible, the agent will falsely report that all the roads in its route are heavily congested.",
        "This is in order to free the path for itself, by making other agents recalculate their paths, this time without including roads on the self-interested agents route.",
        "To this end, for all the roads in its route, which the agent has not yet passed, the agent generates a random weight, which is above the average weight of the roads in the network.",
        "It then associates these new weights with the roads in its route and sends them to the other agents.",
        "While an agent can also divert cars from its route by falsely reporting congested roads in parallel to its route as free, this behavior is not very likely since other agents, attempting to use the roads, will find the mistake within a short time and spread the true congestion on the road.",
        "On the other hand, if an agent manages to persuade other agents not to use a road, it will be harder for them to detect that the said roads are not congested.",
        "In addition, to avoid being influenced by its own lies and other lies spreading in the network, all self-interested agents will ignore data received about roads with heavy traffic (note that data about roads that are not heavily traffic will not be ignored)1 .",
        "In the next subsection we describe the simulation results, involving the self-interested agents. 4.2 Simulation Results To test the benefits of cheating by the self-interested agents we ran several experiments.",
        "In the first set of experiments, we created a scenario, in which a small group of self-interested agents spread lies on the same route, and tested its effect on the journey length of all the agents in the network. 1 In other simulations we have run, in which there had been several real congestions in the network, we indeed saw that even when the roads are jammed, the self-interested agents were less affected if they ignored all reported heavy traffic, since by such they also discarded all lies roaming the network Table 1: Normalized journey length values, selfinterested agents with the same route Iteration Self-Interested Gossip - Gossip - Regular Number Agents SR Others Agents 1 1.38 1.27 1.06 1.06 2 0.95 1.56 1.18 1.14 3 1.00 1.86 1.28 1.17 4 1.06 2.93 1.35 1.16 5 1.13 2.00 1.40 1.17 6 1.08 2.02 1.43 1.18 Thus, several cars, which had the same origin and destination points, were designated as self-interested agents.",
        "In this simulation, we selected only 6 agents to be part of the group of the self-interested agents, as we wanted to investigate the effect achieved by only a small number of agents.",
        "In each simulation in this experiment, 6 different agents were randomly chosen to be part of the group of self-interested agents, as described above.",
        "In addition, one road, on the route of these agents, was randomly selected to be partially blocked, letting only one car go through that road at each time step.",
        "About 8,000 agents were randomly selected as regular gossip agents, and the other 32,000 agents were designated as regular agents.",
        "We analyzed the average journey length of the self-interested agents as opposed to the average journey length of other regular gossip agents traveling along the same route.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the normalized results for the self-interested agents, the gossip agents (those having the same origin and destination points as the self-interested agents, denoted Gossip - SR, and all other gossip agents, denoted Gossip - Others) and the regular agents, as a function of the iteration number.",
        "We can see from the results that the first time the selfinterested agents traveled the route while spreading the false data about the roads did not help them (using the paired t-test we show that those agents had significantly lower journey lengths in the scenario in which they did not spread any lies, with p < 0.01).",
        "This is mainly due to the fact that the lies do not bypass the self-interested agent and reach other cars that are ahead of the self-interested car on the same route.",
        "Thus, spreading the lies in the first iteration does not help the self-interested agent to free the route he is about to travel, in the first iteration.",
        "Only when the self-interested agents had repeated their journey in the next iteration (iteration 2) did it help them significantly (p = 0.04).",
        "The reason for this is that other gossip agents received this data and used it to recalculate their shortest path, thus avoiding entrance to the roads, for which the self-interested agents had spread false information about congestion.",
        "It is also interesting to note the large value attained by the self-interested agents in the first iteration.",
        "This is mainly due to several self-interested agents, who entered the jammed road.",
        "This situation occurred since the self-interested agents ignored all heavy traffic data, and thus ignored the fact that the road was jammed.",
        "As they started spreading lies about this road, more cars shifted from this route, thus making the road free for the future iterations.",
        "However, we also recall that the self-interested agents ignore all information about the heavy traffic roads.",

        "This can be seen, for example, in iterations 4-6, in which the normalized value of the self-interested agents increased above 1.00.",
        "Using the paired t-test to compare these values with the values achieved by these agents when no lies are used, we see that there is no significant difference between the two scenarios.",
        "As opposed to the gossip agents, we can see how little effect the self-interested agents have on the regular agents.",
        "As compared to the gossip agents on the same route that have traveled as much as 193% more, when self-interested agents are introduced, the average journey length for the regular agents has only increased by about 15%.",
        "This result is even lower than the effect on other gossip agents in the entire network.",
        "Since we noticed that cheating by the self-interested agents does not benefit them in the first iteration, we devised another set of experiments.",
        "In the second set of experiments, the self-interested agents have the objective to help another agent, who is supposed to enter the network some time after the self-interested agent entered.",
        "We refer to the latter agent as the beneficiary agent.",
        "Just like a self-interested agent, the beneficiary agent also ignores all data regarding heavy traffic.",
        "In real-life this can be modeled, for example, by a husband, who would like to help his wife find a faster route to her destination.",
        "Table 2 summarizes the normalized values for the different agents.",
        "As in the first set of experiments, 5 simulations were run for each scenario, with a total of 25 simulations.",
        "In each of these simulation one agent was randomly selected as a self-interested agent, and then another agent, with the same origin as the selfinterested agent, was randomly selected as the beneficiary agent.",
        "The other 8,000 and 32,000 agents were designated as regular gossip agents and regular agents, respectively.",
        "We can see that as the number of iterations advances, the lower the normalized value for the beneficiary agent.",
        "In this scenario, just like the previous one, in the first iterations, not only does the beneficiary agent not avoid the jammed roads, since he ignores all heavy traffic, he also does not benefit from the lies spread by the self-interested agent.",
        "This is due to the fact that the lies are not yet incorporated by other gossip agents.",
        "Thus, if we compare the average journey length in the first iteration when lies are spread and when there are no lies, the average is significantly lower when there are no lies (p < 0.03).",
        "On the other hand, if we compare the average journey length in all of the iterations, there is no significant difference between the two settings.",
        "Still, in most of the iterations, the average journey length of the beneficiary agent is longer than in the case when no lies are spread.",
        "We can also see the impact on the other agents in the system.",
        "While the gossip agents, which are not on the route of the beneficiary agent, virtually are not affected by the self-interested agent, those on the route and the regular agents are affected and have higher normalized values.",
        "That is, even with just one self-interested car, we can see that both the gossip agents that follow the same route as the lies spread by the self-interested agents, and other regular agents, increase their journey length by more than 14%.",
        "In our third set of experiments we examined a setting in which there was an increasing number of agents, and the agents did not necessarily have the same origin and destination points.",
        "To model this we randomly selected selfinterested agents, whose objective was to minimize their average journey length, assuming the cars were repeating their journeys (that is, more than one iteration was made).",
        "As opposed to the first set of experiments, in this set the self-interested agents were selected randomly, and we did not enforce the constraint that they will all have the same origin and destination points.",
        "As in the previous sets of experiments we ran 5 different simulations per scenario.",
        "In each simulation 11 runs were made, each run with different numbers of self-interested agents: 0 (no self-interested agents), 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.",
        "Each agent adopted the behavior modeled in Section 4.1.",
        "Figure 1 shows the normalized value achieved by the self-interested agents as a function of their number.",
        "The figure shows these values for iterations 2-6.",

        "Using these simulations we examined what the threshold could be for the number of randomly selected self-interested agents in order to allow themselves to benefit from their selfish behavior.",
        "We can see that up to 8 self-interested agents, the average normalized value is below 1.",
        "That is, they benefit from their malicious behavior.",

        "Yet, as the number of self-interested agents increases, the normalized value also increases.",
        "In such cases, the normalized value is larger than 1, and the self-interested agents journey length becomes significantly higher than their journey length, in cases where there are no self-interested agents in the system.",
        "In the next subsection we analyze the scenario as a game and show that when in equilibrium the exchange of gossiping between the agents becomes inefficient. 4.3 When Gossiping is Inefficient We continued and modeled our scenario as a game, in order to find the equilibrium.",
        "There are two possible types for the agents: (a) regular gossip agents, and (b) self-interested agents.",
        "Each of these agents is a representative of its group, and thus all agents in the same group have similar behavior.",
        "We note that the advantage of using gossiping in transportation networks is to allow the agents to detect anomalies in the network (e.g., traffic jams) and to quickly adapt to them by recalculating their routes [14].",
        "We also assume that the objective of the self-interested agents is to minimize their own journey length, thus they spread lies on their routes, as described in Section 4.1.",
        "We also assume that sophisticated methods for identifying the self-interested agents or managing reputation are not used.",
        "This is mainly due to the complexity of incorporating and maintaining such mechanisms, as well as due to the dynamics of the network, in which interactions between different agents are frequent, agents may leave the network, and data about the road might change as time progresses (e.g., a road might be reported by a regular gossip agent as free at a given time, yet it may currently be jammed due to heavy traffic on the road).",
        "Let Tavg be the average time it takes to traverse an edge in the transportation network (that is, the average load of an edge).",
        "Let Tmax be the maximum time it takes to traverse an edge.",
        "We will investigate the game, in which the self-interested and the regular gossip agents can choose the following actions.",
        "The self-interested agents can choose how much to lie, that is, they can choose to spread how long (not necessarily the true duration) it takes to traverse certain roads.",
        "Since the objective of the self-interested agents is to spread messages as though some roads are jammed, the traversal time they report is obviously larger than the average time.",
        "We denote the time the self-interested agents spread as Ts, such that Tavg ≤ Ts ≤ Tmax.",
        "Motivated by the results of the simulations we have described above, we saw that the agents are less affected if they discard the heavy traffic values.",
        "Thus, the regular gossip cars, attempting to mitigate the effect of the liars, can choose a strategy to ignore abnormal congestion values above a certain threshold, Tg.",
        "Obviously, Tavg ≤ Tg ≤ Tmax.",
        "In order to prevent the gossip agents from detecting the lies and just discarding those values, the self-interested agents send lies in a given range, [Ts, Tmax], with an inverse geometric distribution, that is, the higher the T value, the higher its frequency.",
        "Now we construct the utility functions for each type of agents, which is defined by the values of Ts and Tg.",
        "If the self-interested agents spread traversal times higher than or equal to the regular gossip cars threshold, they will not benefit from those lies.",
        "Thus, the utility value of the selfinterested agents in this case is 0.",
        "On the other hand, if the self-interested agents spread traversal time which is lower than the threshold, they will gain a positive utility value.",
        "From the regular gossip agents point-of-view, if they accept messages from the self-interested agents, then they incorporate the lies in their calculation, thus they will lose utility points.",
        "On the other hand, if they discard the false values the self-interested agents send, that is, they do not incorporate the lies, they will gain utility values.",
        "Formally, we use us to denote the utility of the self-interested agents and ug to denote the utility of the regular gossip agents.",
        "We also denote the strategy profile in the game as {Ts, Tg}.",
        "The utility functions are defined as: us = 0 if Ts ≥ Tg Ts − Tavg + 1 if Ts < Tg (1) ug = Tg − Tavg if Ts ≥ Tg Ts − Tg if Ts < Tg (2) We are interested in finding the Nash equilibrium.",
        "We recall from [12], that the Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile, where no player has anything to gain by deviating from his strategy, given that the other agent follows his strategy profile.",
        "Formally, let (S, u) denote the game, where S is the set of strategy profiles and u is the set of utility functions.",
        "When each agent i ∈ {regular gossip, self-interested} chooses a strategy Ti resulting in a strategy profile T = (Ts, Tg) then agent i obtains a utility of ui (T).",
        "A strategy profile T∗ ∈ S is a Nash equilibrium if no deviation in the strategy by any single agent is profitable, that is, if for all i, ui (T∗ ) ≥ ui (Ti, T∗ −i).",
        "That is, (Ts, Tg) is a Nash equilibrium if the self-interested agents have no other value Ts such that us (Ts, Tg) > us (Ts, Tg), and similarly for the gossip agents.",
        "We now have the following theorem.",
        "Theorem 4.1. (Tavg, Tavg) is the only Nash equilibrium.",
        "Proof.",
        "First we will show that (Tavg, Tavg) is a Nash equilibrium.",
        "Assume, by contradiction, that the gossip agents choose another value Tg > Tavg.",
        "Thus, ug (Tavg, Tg ) = Tavg − Tg < 0.",
        "On the other hand, ug (Tavg, Tavg) = 0.",
        "Thus, the regular gossip agents have no incentive to deviate from this strategy.",
        "The self-interested agents also have no incentive to deviate from this strategy.",
        "By contradiction, again assume that the self-interested agents choose another value Ts > Tavg.",
        "Thus, us (Ts , Tavg) = 0, while us (Tavg, Tavg) = 0.",
        "We will now show that the above solution is unique.",
        "We will show that any other tuple (Ts, Tg), such that Tavg < Tg ≤ Tmax and Tavg < Ts ≤ Tmax is not a Nash equilibrium.",
        "We have three cases.",
        "In the first Tavg < Tg < Ts ≤ Tmax.",
        "Thus, us (Ts, Tg) = 0 and ug (Ts, Tg) = Tg − Tavg.",
        "In this case, the regular gossip agents have an incentive to deviate and choose another strategy Tg + 1, since by doing so they increase their own utility: ug (Ts, Tg + 1) = Tg + 1 − Tavg.",
        "In the second case we have Tavg < Ts < Tg ≤ Tmax.",
        "Thus, ug (Ts, Tg) = Ts − Tg < 0.",
        "Also, the regular gossip agents have an incentive to deviate and choose another strategy Tg −1, in which their utility value is higher: ug (Ts, Tg −1) = Ts − Tg + 1.",
        "In the last case we have Tavg < Ts = Tg ≤ Tmax.",
        "Thus, us (Ts, Tg) = Ts − Tg = 0.",
        "In this case, the self-interested agents have an incentive to deviate and choose another strategy Tg − 1, in which their utility value is higher: us (Tg − 1, Tg) = Tg − 1 − Tavg + 1 = Tg − Tavg > 0. 332 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Indeed, car manufacturers are already equipping their cars with such devices.",
                "Though, currently these systems are a proprietary, we envision a natural evolution where agent applications will be developed for vehicular systems, e.g., to improve car routing in dense urban areas.",

                "An important advancement in this respect is the introduction of ad-hoc communication networks (such as Wi-Fi), which enable the exchange of information between cars, e.g., for locating road congestions [1] and optimal routes [15] or improving traffic safety [2].",
                "Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) communication is already onboard by some car manufactures, enabling the collaboration between different cars on the road.",

                "We build on the notion of Gossip Networks, introduced by Shavitt and Shay [15], in which the agents can obtain road congestion information by gossiping with peer agents using ad-hoc communication.",
                "We recognize two typical behaviors that the self-interested agents could embark upon, in the context of <br>vehicular network</br>s.",
                "In the first behavior, described in Section 4, the objective of the self-interested agents is to maximize their own utility, expressed by their average journey duration on the road.",
                "This situation can be modeled in real life by car owners, whose aim is to reach their destination as fast as possible, and would like to have their way free of other cars.",
                "To this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents, by injecting false information into the network.",
                "This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route to other agents in the network in the hope of making the other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing them to choose a different route.",
                "The second type of behavior, described in Section 5, is modeled by the self-interested agents objective to cause disorder in the network, more than they are interested in maximizing their own utility.",
                "This kind of behavior could be generated, for example, by vandalism or terrorists, who aim to cause as much mayhem in the network as possible.",
                "We note that the introduction of self-interested agents to the network, would most probably motivate other agents to try and detect these agents in order to minimize their effect.",

                "In our domain, however, as the agents constantly move, they have many samples, which they exchange with each other.",
                "Also, the data might also vary (e.g., a road might be reported as jammed, but a few minutes later it could be free), thus making it harder to decide whether to trust the agent, who sent the data.",

                "An important advancement in this respect is the introduction of ad-hoc communication networks (such as Wi-Fi), which enable the exchange of information between cars, e.g., for locating road congestions [1] and optimal routes [15] or improving traffic safety [2].",

                "In the first behavior, described in Section 4, the objective of the self-interested agents is to maximize their own utility, expressed by their average journey duration on the road.",
                "This situation can be modeled in real life by car owners, whose aim is to reach their destination as fast as possible, and would like to have their way free of other cars.",
                "To this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents, by injecting false information into the network.",
                "This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route to other agents in the network in the hope of making the other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing them to choose a different route.",
                "The second type of behavior, described in Section 5, is modeled by the self-interested agents objective to cause disorder in the network, more than they are interested in maximizing their own utility.",

                "In the first behavior, described in Section 4, the objective of the self-interested agents is to maximize their own utility, expressed by their average journey duration on the road.",
                "This situation can be modeled in real life by car owners, whose aim is to reach their destination as fast as possible, and would like to have their way free of other cars.",
                "To this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents, by injecting false information into the network.",
                "This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route to other agents in the network in the hope of making the other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing them to choose a different route.",
                "The second type of behavior, described in Section 5, is modeled by the self-interested agents objective to cause disorder in the network, more than they are interested in maximizing their own utility.",

                "In the first behavior, described in Section 4, the objective of the self-interested agents is to maximize their own utility, expressed by their average journey duration on the road.",
                "This situation can be modeled in real life by car owners, whose aim is to reach their destination as fast as possible, and would like to have their way free of other cars.",
                "To this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents, by injecting false information into the network.",
                "This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route to other agents in the network in the hope of making the other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing them to choose a different route.",

                "Indeed, car manufacturers are already equipping their cars with such devices.",
                "Though, currently these systems are a proprietary, we envision a natural evolution where agent applications will be developed for vehicular systems, e.g., to improve car routing in dense urban areas.",
                "Nonetheless, this new technology and agent applications may lead to the emergence of self-interested car owners, who will care more about their own welfare than the social welfare of their peers.",

                "INTRODUCTION As technology advances, more and more cars are being equipped with devices, which enable them to act as autonomous agents.",
                "An important advancement in this respect is the introduction of ad-hoc communication networks (such as Wi-Fi), which enable the exchange of information between cars, e.g., for locating road congestions [1] and optimal routes [15] or improving traffic safety [2].",
                "Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) communication is already onboard by some car manufactures, enabling the collaboration between different cars on the road.",
                "For example, GMs proprietary algorithm [6], called the threat assessment algorithm, constantly calculates, in real time, other vehicles positions and speeds, and enables messaging other cars when a collision is imminent; Also, Honda has began testing its system in which vehicles talk with each other and with the highway system itself [7].",
                "In this paper, we investigate the attraction of being a selfish agent in vehicular networks.",
                "That is, we investigate the benefits achieved by car owners, who tamper with on-board devices and incorporate their own self-interested agents in them, which act for their benefit.",
                "We build on the notion of Gossip Networks, introduced by Shavitt and Shay [15], in which the agents can obtain road congestion information by gossiping with peer agents using ad-hoc communication.",
                "We recognize two typical behaviors that the self-interested agents could embark upon, in the context of vehicular networks.",
                "In the first behavior, described in Section 4, the objective of the self-interested agents is to maximize their own utility, expressed by their average journey duration on the road.",
                "This situation can be modeled in real life by car owners, whose aim is to reach their destination as fast as possible, and would like to have their way free of other cars.",
                "To this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents, by injecting false information into the network.",
                "This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route to other agents in the network in the hope of making the other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing them to choose a different route.",
                "The second type of behavior, described in Section 5, is modeled by the self-interested agents objective to cause disorder in the network, more than they are interested in maximizing their own utility.",
                "This kind of behavior could be generated, for example, by vandalism or terrorists, who aim to cause as much mayhem in the network as possible.",
                "We note that the introduction of self-interested agents to the network, would most probably motivate other agents to try and detect these agents in order to minimize their effect.",

                "As opposed to the above works, our work focuses on vehicular networks, in which the agents are constantly roaming the network and exchanging data.",
                "Also, the domain of transportation networks introduces dynamic data, as the load of the roads is subject to change.",
                "In addition, the system in transportation networks has a feedback mechanism, since the load in the roads depends on the reports and the movement of the agents themselves.",

                "Nevertheless, their work assumes that the network is static and also that the agents are static (they discuss a network of processors).",
                "This is not true for transportation networks.",
                "For example, in our model, agents might gossip about heavy traffic load of a specific road, which is currently jammed, yet this information might be false several minutes later, leaving the agents to speculate whether the spreading agents are indeed malicious or not.",
                "In addition, as the agents are constantly moving, each agent cannot choose with whom he interacts and exchanges data.",
                "In the context of analyzing the data and deciding whether the data is true or not, researchers have focused on distributed reputation systems or decision mechanisms to decide whether or not to share data.",

                "Every agent keeps a list of its neighbors, which can be changed over time, and computes the trustworthiness of other agents by updating the current values of testimonies obtained from reliable referral chains.",
                "After a bad experience with another agent every agent decreases the rating of the bad agent and propagates this bad experience throughout the network so that other agents can update their ratings accordingly.",
                "This approach might be implemented in our domain to allow gossip agents to identify self-interested agents and thus minimize their effect.",
                "However, the implementation of such a mechanism is an expensive addition to the infrastructure of autonomous agents in transportation networks.",
                "This is mainly due to the dynamic nature of the list of neighbors in transportation networks.",
                "Thus, not only does it require maintaining the neighbors list, since the neighbors change frequently, but it is also harder to build a good reputation system.",

                "In their domain, the goal of all the agents is to reach a global consensus about the likelihood of the hypothesis.",
                "In our domain, however, as the agents constantly move, they have many samples, which they exchange with each other.",
                "Also, the data might also vary (e.g., a road might be reported as jammed, but a few minutes later it could be free), thus making it harder to decide whether to trust the agent, who sent the data.",
                "Moreover, the agent might lie only about a subset of its samples, thus making it even harder to detect his cheating.",

                "To this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents, by injecting false information into the network.",
                "This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route to other agents in the network in the hope of making the other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing them to choose a different route.",

                "Indeed, car manufacturers are already equipping their cars with such devices.",
                "Though, currently these systems are a proprietary, we envision a natural evolution where agent applications will be developed for vehicular systems, e.g., to improve car routing in dense urban areas.",
                "Nonetheless, this new technology and agent applications may lead to the emergence of self-interested car owners, who will care more about their own welfare than the social welfare of their peers.",
                "These car owners will try to manipulate their agents such that they transmit false data to their peers.",
                "Using a simulation environment, which models a real transportation network in a large city, we demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents if no counter-measures are implemented.",

                "INTRODUCTION As technology advances, more and more cars are being equipped with devices, which enable them to act as autonomous agents.",
                "An important advancement in this respect is the introduction of ad-hoc communication networks (such as Wi-Fi), which enable the exchange of information between cars, e.g., for locating road congestions [1] and optimal routes [15] or improving traffic safety [2].",
                "Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) communication is already onboard by some car manufactures, enabling the collaboration between different cars on the road.",
                "For example, GMs proprietary algorithm [6], called the threat assessment algorithm, constantly calculates, in real time, other vehicles positions and speeds, and enables messaging other cars when a collision is imminent; Also, Honda has began testing its system in which vehicles talk with each other and with the highway system itself [7].",
                "In this paper, we investigate the attraction of being a selfish agent in vehicular networks.",
                "That is, we investigate the benefits achieved by car owners, who tamper with on-board devices and incorporate their own self-interested agents in them, which act for their benefit.",
                "We build on the notion of Gossip Networks, introduced by Shavitt and Shay [15], in which the agents can obtain road congestion information by gossiping with peer agents using ad-hoc communication.",
                "We recognize two typical behaviors that the self-interested agents could embark upon, in the context of vehicular networks.",
                "In the first behavior, described in Section 4, the objective of the self-interested agents is to maximize their own utility, expressed by their average journey duration on the road.",
                "This situation can be modeled in real life by car owners, whose aim is to reach their destination as fast as possible, and would like to have their way free of other cars.",
                "To this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents, by injecting false information into the network.",
                "This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route to other agents in the network in the hope of making the other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing them to choose a different route.",
                "The second type of behavior, described in Section 5, is modeled by the self-interested agents objective to cause disorder in the network, more than they are interested in maximizing their own utility.",
                "This kind of behavior could be generated, for example, by vandalism or terrorists, who aim to cause as much mayhem in the network as possible.",
                "We note that the introduction of self-interested agents to the network, would most probably motivate other agents to try and detect these agents in order to minimize their effect.",
                "This is similar, though in a different context, to the problem introduced by Lamport et al. [8] as the Byzantine Generals Problem.",
                "However, the introduction of mechanisms to deal with self-interested agents is costly and time consuming.",
                "In this paper we focus mainly on the attractiveness of selfish behavior by these agents, while we also provide some insights 327 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS into the possibility of detecting self-interested agents and minimizing their effect.",
                "To demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents, we have used a simulation environment, which models the transportation network in a central part of a large real city.",

                "As opposed to the above works, our work focuses on vehicular networks, in which the agents are constantly roaming the network and exchanging data.",
                "Also, the domain of transportation networks introduces dynamic data, as the load of the roads is subject to change.",
                "In addition, the system in transportation networks has a feedback mechanism, since the load in the roads depends on the reports and the movement of the agents themselves.",

                "Nevertheless, their work assumes that the network is static and also that the agents are static (they discuss a network of processors).",
                "This is not true for transportation networks.",
                "For example, in our model, agents might gossip about heavy traffic load of a specific road, which is currently jammed, yet this information might be false several minutes later, leaving the agents to speculate whether the spreading agents are indeed malicious or not.",
                "In addition, as the agents are constantly moving, each agent cannot choose with whom he interacts and exchanges data.",
                "In the context of analyzing the data and deciding whether the data is true or not, researchers have focused on distributed reputation systems or decision mechanisms to decide whether or not to share data.",

                "Every agent keeps a list of its neighbors, which can be changed over time, and computes the trustworthiness of other agents by updating the current values of testimonies obtained from reliable referral chains.",
                "After a bad experience with another agent every agent decreases the rating of the bad agent and propagates this bad experience throughout the network so that other agents can update their ratings accordingly.",
                "This approach might be implemented in our domain to allow gossip agents to identify self-interested agents and thus minimize their effect.",
                "However, the implementation of such a mechanism is an expensive addition to the infrastructure of autonomous agents in transportation networks.",
                "This is mainly due to the dynamic nature of the list of neighbors in transportation networks.",
                "Thus, not only does it require maintaining the neighbors list, since the neighbors change frequently, but it is also harder to build a good reputation system.",

                "In our domain, however, as the agents constantly move, they have many samples, which they exchange with each other.",
                "Also, the data might also vary (e.g., a road might be reported as jammed, but a few minutes later it could be free), thus making it harder to decide whether to trust the agent, who sent the data.",
                "Moreover, the agent might lie only about a subset of its samples, thus making it even harder to detect his cheating.",
