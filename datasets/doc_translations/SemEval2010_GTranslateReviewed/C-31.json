Mahmoud Distributed Computing and Wireless & Telecommunications Technology University of Guelph-Humber Toronto, ON, M9W 5L7 Canada {jreyno04,rmcleo01,qmahmoud}@uoguelph.ca ABSTRACT Many organizations are required to author documents for various purposes, and such documents may need to be accessible by all member of the organization. This access may be needed for editing or simply viewing a document. In some cases these documents are shared between authors, via email, to be edited. This can easily cause incorrect version to be sent or conflicts created between multiple users trying to make amendments to a document. There may even be multiple different documents in the process of being edited. The user may be required to search for a particular document, which some search tools such as Google Desktop may be a solution for local documents but will not find a document on another users machine. Another problem arises when a document is made available on a users machine and that user is offline, in which case the document is no longer accessible. In this paper we present Apocrita, a revolutionary distributed P2P file sharing system for Intranets.

INTRODUCTION The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing paradigm is becoming a completely new form of mutual resource sharing over the Internet. With the increasingly common place broadband Internet access, P2P technology has finally become a viable way to share documents and media files. There are already programs on the market that enable P2P file sharing. These programs enable millions of users to share files among themselves. While the utilization of P2P clients is already a gigantic step forward compared to downloading files off websites, using such programs are not without their problems. The downloaded files still require a lot of manual management by the user. The user still needs to put the files in the proper directory, manage files with multiple versions, delete the files when they are no longer wanted. We strive to make the process of sharing documents within an Intranet easier. Many organizations are required to author documents for various purposes, and such documents may need to be accessible by all members of the organization. This access may be needed for editing or simply viewing a document. In some cases these documents are sent between authors, via email, to be edited. This can easily cause incorrect version to be sent or conflicts created between multiple users trying to make amendments to a document. There may even be multiple different documents in the process of being edited. The user may be required to search for a particular document, which some search tools such as Google Desktop may be a solution for local documents but will not find a document on another users machine. Furthermore, some organizations do not have a file sharing server or the necessary network infrastructure to enable one. In this paper we present Apocrita, which is a cost-effective distributed P2P file sharing system for such organizations. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present Apocrita. The distributed indexing mechanism and protocol are presented in Section 3. Section 4 presents the peer-topeer distribution model. A proof of concept prototype is presented in Section 5, and performance evaluations are discussed in Section 6. Related work is presented is Section 7, and finally conclusions and future work are discussed in Section 8. 2. APOCRITA Apocrita is a distributed peer-to-peer file sharing system, and has been designed to make finding documents easier in an Intranet environment. Currently, it is possible for documents to be located on a users machine or on a remote machine. It is even possible that different revisions could reside on each node on the Intranet. This means there must be a manual process to maintain document versions. Apocrita solves this problem using two approaches. First, due to the inherent nature of Apocrita, the document will only reside on a single logical location. Second, Apocrita provides a method of reverting to previous document versions.

For example, if a machine contains an important document and the machine is currently inaccessible, the system is capable of maintaining availability of the document through this distribution mechanism. It provides a simple interface for searching and accessing files that may exist either locally or remotely. The distributed nature of the documents is transparent to the user. Apocrita supports a decentralized network model where the peers use a discovery protocol to determine peers. Apocrita is intended for network users on an Intranet. The main focus is organizations that may not have a network large enough to require a file server and supporting infrastructure. It eliminates the need for documents to be manually shared between users while being edited and reduces the possibility of conflicting versions being distributed. The system also provides some redundancy and in the event of a single machine failure, no important documents will be lost. It is operating system independent, and easy to access through a web browser or through a standalone application. To decrease the time required for indexing a large number of documents, the indexing process is distributed across available idle nodes. Local and remote files should be easily accessible through a virtual mountable file system, providing transparency for users. 3. DISTRIBUTED INDEXING Apocrita uses a distributed index for all the documents that are available on the Intranet. Each node will contain part of the full index, and be aware of what part of the index each other node has. A node will be able to contact each node that contains a unique portion of the index. In addition, each node has a separate local index of its own documents. But as discussed later, in the current implementation, each node has a copy of the entire index. Indexing of the documents is distributed. Therefore, if a node is in the process of indexing many documents, it will break up the work over the nodes. Once a nodes local index is updated with the new documents, the distributed index will then be updated. The current distributed indexing system consists of three separate modules: NodeController, FileSender, and NodeIndexer. The responsibility of each module is discussed later in this section. 3.1 Indexing Protocol The protocol we have designed for the distributed indexing is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Apocrita distributed indexing protocol. IDLE QUERY: The IDLE QUERY is sent out from the initiating node to determine which other nodes may be able to help with the overall indexing process. There are no parameters sent with the command. The receiving node will respond with either a BUSY or IDLE command. If the IDLE command is received, the initiating node will add the responding node to a list of available distributed indexing helpers. In the case of a BUSY command being received, the responding node is ignored. BUSY: Once a node received an IDL QUERY, it will determine whether it can be considered a candidate for distributed indexing. This determination is based on the overall CPU usage of the node. If the node is using most of its CPU for other processes, the node will respond to the IDLE QUERY with a BUSY command. IDLE: As with the case of the BUSY response, the node receiving the IDLE QUERY will determine its eligibility for distributed indexing. To be considered a candidate for distributed indexing, the overall CPU usage must be at a minimum to all for dedicated indexing of the distributed documents. If this is the case, the node will respond with an IDLE command. INCOMING FILE: Once the initiating node assembles a set of idle nodes to assist with the distributed indexing, it will divide the documents to be sent to the nodes. To do this, it sends an INCOMING FILE message, which contains the name of the file as well as the size in bytes. After the INCOMING FILE command has been sent, the initiating node will begin to stream the file to the other node. The initiating node will loop through the files that are to be sent to the other node; each file stream being preceded by the INCOMING FILE command with the appropriate parameters. INDEX FILE: Once the indexing node has completed the indexing process of the set of files, it must send the resultant index back to the initiating node. The index is comprised of multiple files, which exist on the file system of the indexing node. As with the INCOMING FILE command, the indexing node streams each index file after sending an INDEX FILE command. The INDEX FILE command has two parameters: the first being the name of the index, and the second is the size of the file in bytes. SEND COMPLETE: When sending the sets of files for both the index and the files to be indexed, the node must notify the corresponding node when the process is complete. Once the initiating node is finished sending the set of documents to be indexed, it will then send a SEND COMPLETE command indicating to the indexing node that there are no more files and the node can proceed with indexing the files. In the case of the initiating node sending the index files, the indexing node will complete the transfer with the SEND COMPLETE command indicating to the initiating node that there are no more index files to be sent and the initiating node can then assemble those index files into the main index. The NodeController is responsible for setting up connections with nodes in the idle state to distribute the indexing process. Using JXTA [5], the node controller will obtain a set of nodes. This set of nodes is iterated and each one is sent the IDLE QUERY command. The nodes that respond with idle are then collected. The set of idle nodes includes the node initiating the distributed indexing process, referred to as the local node. Once the collection of idle nodes is obtained, the node updates the set of controllers and evenly divides the set of documents that are to be indexed. For example, if there are 100 documents and 10 nodes (including the local node) then each node will have 10 documents to index. For each indexing node an instance of the FileSender object is created. The FileSender is aware of the set of documents that node is responsible for. Once a FileSender object has been created for each node, the NodeController waits for each FileSender to complete. When the FileSender objects have completed the NodeController will take the resultant indexes from 175 each node and pass them to an instance of the IndexCompiler, which maintains the index and the list of FileSenders. Once the IndexCompiler has completed it will return to the idle state and activate the directory scanner to monitor the locally owned set of documents for changes that may require reindexing. The NodeIndexer is responsible for receiving documents sent to it by the initiating node and then indexing them using the Lucene engine [7]. Once the indexing is complete the resulting index is streamed back to the initiating node as well as compiled in the indexer nodes own local index. Before initiating the indexing process it must be sent an IDLE QUERY message. This is the first command that sets off the indexing process. The indexer node will determine whether it is considered idle based on the current CPU usage. As outlined in the protocol section if the node is not being used and has a low overall CPU usage percentage it will return IDLE to the IDLE QUERY command. If the indexer nodes CPU usage is above 50% for a specified amount of time it is then considered to be busy and will respond to the IDLE QUERY command with BUSY. If a node is determined busy it returns to its listening state waiting for another IDLE QUERY from another initiating node. If the node is determined to be idle it will enter the state where it will receive files from the initiating node that it is responsible for indexing. Once all of the files are received by the initiating node, indicated by a SEND COMPLETE message, it starts an instance of the Lucene indexing engine. The files are stored in a temporary directory separate from the nodes local documents that it is responsible for maintaining an index of. The Lucene index writer then indexes all of the transferred files. The index is stored on the drive within a temporary directory separate from the current index. After the indexing of the files completes the indexer node enters the state where the index files are sent back to the initiating node. The indexer node loops through all of the files created by Lucenes IndexWriter and streams them to the initiating node. Once these files are sent back that index is then merged into the indexer nodes own full index of the existing files. It then enters the idle state where it will then listen for any other nodes that required distributing the indexing process. The FileSender object is the initiating node equivalent of the indexer node. It initiates the communication between the initiating node and the node that will assist in the distributed indexing. The initiating node runs many instances of the FileSender node one for each other node it has determined to be idle. Upon instantiation of the FileSender it is passed the node that it is responsible for contacting and the set of files that must be sent. The FileSenders first job is to send the files that are to be indexed by the other idle node. The files are streamed one at a time to the other node. It sends each file using the INCOMING FILE command. With that command it sends the name of the file being sent and the size in bytes. Once all files have been sent the FileSender sends the SEND COMPLETE command. The FileSender creates an instance of Lucenes IndexWriter and prepares to create the index in a temporary directory on the file system. The FileSender will begin to receive the files that are to be saved within the index. It receives an INDEX FILE command with the name of the files and the size in bytes. This file is then streamed into the temporary index directory on the FileSender node. After the transfer of the index files has been completed the FileSender notifies the instance of the index compiler that it is ready to combine the index. Each instance of the FileSender has its own unique section of temporary space to store the index that has been transferred back from the indexing node. When notifying the IndexCompiler it will also pass the location of the particular FileSenders directory location of that index. 4. PEER-TO-PEER DISTRIBUTION Apocrita uses a peer-to-peer distribution model in order to distribute files. Files are distributed solely from a serving node to a client node without regard for the availability of file pieces from other clients in the network. This means that the file transfers will be fast and efficient and should not severely affect the usability of serving nodes from the point of view of a local user. The JXTA framework [5] is used in order to implement peer-to-peer functionality. This has been decided due to the extremely shorttimeline of the project which allows us to take advantage of over five years of testing and development and support from many large organizations employing JXTA in their own products. We are not concerned with any potential quality problems because JXTA is considered to be the most mature and stable peer-to-peer framework available. Using JXTA terminology, there are three types of peers used in node classification. Edge peers are typically low-bandwidth, non-dedicated nodes. Due to these characteristics, edge peers are not used with Apocrita. Relay peers are typically higher-bandwidth, dedicated nodes. This is the classification of all nodes in the Apocrita network, and, as such, are the default classification used. Rendezvous peers are used to coordinate message passing between nodes in the Apocrita network. This means that a minimum of one rendezvous peer per subnet is required. 4.1 Peer Discovery The Apocrita server subsystem uses the JXTA Peer Discovery Protocol (PDP) in order to find participating peers within the network as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Apocrita peer discovery process. 176 The PDP listens for peer advertisements from other nodes in the Apocrita swarm. If a peer advertisement is detected, the server will attempt to join the peer group and start actively contributing to the network. If no peers are found by the discovery service, the server will create a new peer group and start advertising this peer group. This new peer group will be periodically advertised on the network; any new peers joining the network will attach to this peer group. A distinct advantage of using the JXTA PDP is that Apocrita does not have to be sensitive to particular networking nuances such as Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). In addition, Apocrita does not have to support one-to-many packet delivery methods such as multicast and instead can rely on JXTA for this support. 4.2 Index Query Operation All nodes in the Apocrita swarm have a complete and up-to-date copy of the network index stored locally. This makes querying the index for search results trivial. Unlike the Gnutella protocol, a query does not have to propagate throughout the network. This also means that the time to return query results is very fast - much faster than protocols that rely on nodes in the network to pass the query throughout the network and then wait for results. This is demonstrated in Figure 3. Figure 3. Apocrita query operation. Each document in the swarm has a unique document identification number (ID). A node will query the index and a result will be returned with both the document ID number as well as a list of peers with a copy of the matched document ID. It is then the responsibility of the searching peer to contact the peers in the list to negotiate file transfer between the client and server. 5. PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION Apocrita uses the Lucene framework [7], which is a project under development by the Apache Software Foundation. Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. In the current implementation, Apocrita is only capable of indexing plain text documents. Apocrita uses the JXTA framework [5] as a peer-to-peer transport library between nodes. JXTA is used to pass both messages and files between nodes in the search network. By using JXTA, Apocrita takes advantage of a reliable, and proven peer-to-peer transport mechanism. It uses the pipe facility in order to pass messages and files between nodes. The pipe facility provides many different types of pipe advertisements. This includes an unsecured unicast pipe, a secured unicast pipe, and a propagated unsecured pipe. Message passing is used to pass status messages between nodes in order to aid in indexing, searching, and retrieval. For example, a node attempting to find an idle node to participate in indexing will query nodes via the message facility. Idle nodes will reply with a status message to indicate they are available to start indexing. File passing is used within Apocrita for file transfer. After a file has been searched for and located within the peer group, a JXTA socket will be opened and file transfer will take place. A JXTA socket is similar to a standard Java socket, however a JXTA socket uses JXTA pipes in underlying network transport. File passing uses an unsecured unicast pipe in order to transfer data. File passing is also used within Apocrita for index transfer. Index transfer works exactly like a file transfer. In fact, the index transfer actually passes the index as a file. However, there is one key difference between file transfer and index transfer. In the case of file transfer, a socket is created between only two nodes. In the case of index transfer, a socket must be created between all nodes in the network in order to pass the index, which allows for all nodes to have a full and complete index of the entire network. In order to facilitate this transfer efficiently, index transfer will use an unsecured propagated pipe to communicate with all nodes in the Apocrita network. 6. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION It is difficult to objectively benchmark the results obtained through Apocrita because there is no other system currently available with the same goals as Apocrita. We have, however, evaluated the performance of the critical sections of the system. The critical sections were determined to be the processes that are the most time intensive. The evaluation was completed on standard lab computers on a 100Mb/s Ethernet LAN; the machines run Windows XP with a Pentium 4 CPU running at 2.4GHz with 512 MB of RAM. The indexing time has been run against both: the Time Magazine collection [8], which contains 432 documents and 83 queries and their most relevant results, and the NPL collection [8] that has a total of 11,429 documents and 93 queries with expected results. Each document ranges in size between 4KB and 8KB. As Figure 4 demonstrates, the number of nodes involved in the indexing process affects the time taken to complete the indexing processsometimes even drastically. Figure 4. Node vs. index time. The difference in going from one indexing node to two indexing nodes is the most drastic and equates to an indexing time 37% faster than a single indexing node. The different between two 177 indexing nodes and three indexing nodes is still significant and represents a 16% faster time than two indexing nodes. As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic. This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing. The time needed to communicate with a node is constant, so as the number of nodes increases, this constant becomes more prevalent. Also, the complexity of joining the indexing results is a complex operation and is complicated further as the number of indexing nodes increases. Socket performance is also a very important part of Apocrita. Benchmarks were performed using a 65MB file on a system with both the client and server running locally. This was done to isolate possible network issues. Although less drastic, similar results were shown when the client and server run on independent hardware. In order to mitigate possible unexpected errors, each test was run 10 times. Figure 5. Java sockets vs. JXTA sockets. As Figure 5 demonstrates, the performance of JXTA sockets is abysmal as compared to the performance of standard Java sockets. The minimum transfer rate obtained using Java sockets is 81,945KB/s while the minimum transfer rater obtained using JXTA sockets is much lower at 3, 805KB/s. The maximum transfer rater obtain using Java sockets is 97,412KB/s while the maximum transfer rate obtained using JXTA sockets is 5,530KB/s. Finally, the average transfer rate using Java sockets is 87,540KB/s while the average transfer rate using JXTA sockets is 4,293KB/s. The major problem found in these benchmarks is that the underlying network transport mechanism does not perform as quickly or efficiently as expected. In order to garner a performance increase, the JXTA framework needs to be substituted with a more traditional approach. The indexing time is also a bottleneck and will need to be improved for the overall quality of Apocrita to be improved. 7. RELATED WORK Several decentralized P2P systems [1, 2, 3] exist today that Apocrita features some of their functionality. However, Apocrita also has unique novel searching and indexing features that make this system unique. For example, Majestic-12 [4] is a distributed search and indexing project designed for searching the Internet. Each user would install a client, which is responsible for indexing a portion of the web. A central area for querying the index is available on the Majestic-12 web page. The index itself is not distributed, only the act of indexing is distributed. The distributed indexing aspect of this project most closely relates Apocrita goals. YaCy [6] is a peer-to-peer web search application. YaCy consists of a web crawler, an indexer, a built-in database engine, and a p2p index exchange protocol. YaCy is designed to maintain a distributed index of the Internet. It used a distributed hash table (DHT) to maintain the index. The local node is used to query but all results that are returned are accessible on the Internet. YaCy used many peers and DHT to maintain a distributed index. Apocrita will also use a distributed index in future implementations and may benefit from using an implementation of a DHT. YaCy however, is designed as a web search engine and, as such solves a much different problem than Apocrita. 8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We presented Apocrita, a distributed P2P searching and indexing system intended for network users on an Intranet. It can help organizations with no network file server or necessary network infrastructure to share documents. It eliminates the need for documents to be manually shared among users while being edited and reduce the possibility of conflicting versions being distributed. A proof of concept prototype has been constructed, but the results from measuring the network transport mechanism and the indexing time were not as impressive as initially envisioned. Despite these shortcomings, the experience gained from the design and implementation of Apocrita has given us more insight into building challenging distributed systems. For future work, Apocrita will have a smart content distribution model in which a single instance of a file can intelligently and transparently replicate throughout the network to ensure a copy of every important file will always be available regardless of the availability of specific nodes in the network. In addition, we plan to integrate a revision control system into the content distribution portion of Apocrita so that users could have the ability to update an existing file that they found and have the old revision maintained and the new revision propagated. Finally, the current implementation has some overhead and redundancy due to the fact that the entire index is maintained on each individual node, we plan to design a distributed index. 9.

IntroducciÃ³n El paradigma informÃ¡tico entre pares (P2P) se estÃ¡ convirtiendo en una forma completamente nueva de intercambio de recursos mutuos en Internet. Con el acceso a Internet de banda ancha cada vez mÃ¡s comÃºn, la tecnologÃ­a P2P finalmente se ha convertido en una forma viable de compartir documentos y archivos de medios. Ya hay programas en el mercado que habilitan el intercambio de archivos P2P. Estos programas permiten a millones de usuarios compartir archivos entre ellos. Si bien la utilizaciÃ³n de los clientes P2P ya es un paso gigantesco en comparaciÃ³n con la descarga de archivos de los sitios web, el uso de tales programas no estÃ¡ exento de problemas. Los archivos descargados aÃºn requieren mucha administraciÃ³n manual por parte del usuario. El usuario aÃºn necesita colocar los archivos en el directorio adecuado, administrar archivos con mÃºltiples versiones, eliminar los archivos cuando ya no se desee. Nos esforzamos por facilitar el proceso de compartir documentos dentro de una intranet. Se requiere que muchas organizaciones sean documentos de los autores para diversos fines, y dichos documentos pueden necesitar ser accesibles por todos los miembros de la organizaciÃ³n. Este acceso puede ser necesario para editar o simplemente ver un documento. En algunos casos, estos documentos se envÃ­an entre autores, por correo electrÃ³nico, para editar. Esto puede hacer que se envÃ­en una versiÃ³n incorrecta o se crean conflictos entre varios usuarios que intentan hacer enmiendas a un documento.

Es posible que el usuario busque un documento en particular, que algunas herramientas de bÃºsqueda, como Google Desktop, pueden ser una soluciÃ³n para documentos locales, pero no encontrarÃ¡n un documento en otra mÃ¡quina de usuarios. AdemÃ¡s, algunas organizaciones no tienen un servidor de intercambio de archivos o la infraestructura de red necesaria para habilitar una. En este artÃ­culo presentamos a Apocrita, que es un sistema de intercambio de archivos P2P distribuido rentable para tales organizaciones. El resto de este documento estÃ¡ organizado de la siguiente manera. En la SecciÃ³n 2, presentamos Apocrita. El mecanismo de indexaciÃ³n y protocolo distribuido se presentan en la SecciÃ³n 3. La SecciÃ³n 4 presenta el modelo de distribuciÃ³n entre pares. En la SecciÃ³n 5 se presenta un prototipo de prueba de concepto, y las evaluaciones de rendimiento se analizan en la SecciÃ³n 6. El trabajo relacionado se presenta es la SecciÃ³n 7, y finalmente las conclusiones y el trabajo futuro se discuten en la SecciÃ³n 8. 2. Apocrita apocrita es un sistema distribuido de intercambio de archivos entre pares, y ha sido diseÃ±ado para facilitar la bÃºsqueda de documentos en un entorno de intranet. Actualmente, es posible que los documentos se encuentren en una mÃ¡quina de usuarios o en una mÃ¡quina remota. Incluso es posible que diferentes revisiones puedan residir en cada nodo en la intranet. Esto significa que debe haber un proceso manual para mantener versiones de documentos. Apocrita resuelve este problema utilizando dos enfoques. Primero, debido a la naturaleza inherente de Apocrita, el documento solo residirÃ¡ en una sola ubicaciÃ³n lÃ³gica. En segundo lugar, Apocrita proporciona un mÃ©todo de revertir a versiones de documentos anteriores. El permiso de Apocrita para hacer copias digitales o difÃ­ciles de todo o parte de este trabajo para uso personal o en el aula se otorga sin tarifa siempre que las copias no sean o se distribuyan para obtener ganancias o ventajas comerciales y que las copias tengan este aviso y la cita completa del primeropÃ¡gina. Copiar lo contrario, o volver a publicar, publicar en servidores o redistribuir a las listas, requiere un permiso especÃ­fico previo y/o una tarifa.

Por ejemplo, si una mÃ¡quina contiene un documento importante y la mÃ¡quina es actualmente inaccesible, el sistema es capaz de mantener la disponibilidad del documento a travÃ©s de este mecanismo de distribuciÃ³n. Proporciona una interfaz simple para buscar y acceder a archivos que pueden existir locales o de forma remota. La naturaleza distribuida de los documentos es transparente para el usuario. Apocrita admite un modelo de red descentralizado donde los pares usan un protocolo de descubrimiento para determinar los compaÃ±eros. Apocrita estÃ¡ destinado a usuarios de red en una intranet. El enfoque principal son las organizaciones que pueden no tener una red lo suficientemente grande como para requerir un servidor de archivos e infraestructura de soporte. Elimina la necesidad de que los documentos se compartan manualmente entre los usuarios mientras se editan y reduce la posibilidad de distribuir versiones conflictivas. El sistema tambiÃ©n proporciona cierta redundancia y, en caso de falla de una sola mÃ¡quina, no se perderÃ¡n documentos importantes. Es independiente del sistema operativo y fÃ¡cil de acceder a travÃ©s de un navegador web o a travÃ©s de una aplicaciÃ³n independiente. Para disminuir el tiempo requerido para indexar una gran cantidad de documentos, el proceso de indexaciÃ³n se distribuye en los nodos inactivos disponibles. Los archivos locales y remotos deben ser fÃ¡cilmente accesibles a travÃ©s de un sistema de archivos de montaje virtual, proporcionando transparencia para los usuarios.3. IndexaciÃ³n distribuida Apocrita utiliza un Ã­ndice distribuido para todos los documentos que estÃ¡n disponibles en la intranet. Cada nodo contendrÃ¡ parte del Ã­ndice completo y tendrÃ¡ en cuenta quÃ© parte del Ã­ndice tiene el nodo del otro. Un nodo podrÃ¡ contactar a cada nodo que contenga una parte Ãºnica del Ã­ndice. AdemÃ¡s, cada nodo tiene un Ã­ndice local separado de sus propios documentos. Pero como se discutiÃ³ mÃ¡s adelante, en la implementaciÃ³n actual, cada nodo tiene una copia de todo el Ã­ndice. Se distribuye la indexaciÃ³n de los documentos. Por lo tanto, si un nodo estÃ¡ en el proceso de indexar muchos documentos, romperÃ¡ el trabajo sobre los nodos. Una vez que se actualiza un Ã­ndice local de nodos con los nuevos documentos, el Ã­ndice distribuido se actualizarÃ¡. El sistema de indexaciÃ³n distribuida actual consta de tres mÃ³dulos separados: NodeController, FileSender y NodeIdexer. La responsabilidad de cada mÃ³dulo se discute mÃ¡s adelante en esta secciÃ³n.3.1 Protocolo de indexaciÃ³n El protocolo que hemos diseÃ±ado para la indexaciÃ³n distribuida se muestra en la Figura 1. Figura 1. Protocolo de indexaciÃ³n distribuida de Apocrita. Consulta inactiva: la consulta inactiva se envÃ­a desde el nodo iniciador para determinar quÃ© otros nodos pueden ayudar con el proceso de indexaciÃ³n general. No se envÃ­an parÃ¡metros con el comando. El nodo receptor responderÃ¡ con un comando ocupado o inactivo. Si se recibe el comando inactivo, el nodo de iniciaciÃ³n agregarÃ¡ el nodo de respuesta a una lista de ayudantes de indexaciÃ³n distribuidos disponibles. En el caso de que se reciba un comando ocupado, se ignora el nodo de respuesta. Ocupado: una vez que un nodo recibiÃ³ una consulta IDL, determinarÃ¡ si puede considerarse un candidato para la indexaciÃ³n distribuida. Esta determinaciÃ³n se basa en el uso general de la CPU del nodo. Si el nodo estÃ¡ utilizando la mayorÃ­a de su CPU para otros procesos, el nodo responderÃ¡ a la consulta inactiva con un comando ocupado. Idle: Al igual que con el caso de la respuesta ocupada, el nodo que recibe la consulta inactiva determinarÃ¡ su elegibilidad para la indexaciÃ³n distribuida. Para ser considerado un candidato para la indexaciÃ³n distribuida, el uso general de la CPU debe ser mÃ­nimo a todos para la indexaciÃ³n dedicada de los documentos distribuidos. Si este es el caso, el nodo responderÃ¡ con un comando inactivo. Archivo entrante: una vez que el nodo iniciador ensambla un conjunto de nodos inactivos para ayudar con la indexaciÃ³n distribuida, dividirÃ¡ los documentos que se enviarÃ¡n a los nodos. Para hacer esto, envÃ­a un mensaje de archivo entrante, que contiene el nombre del archivo, asÃ­ como el tamaÃ±o en los bytes. DespuÃ©s de que se haya enviado el comando de archivo entrante, el nodo de iniciaciÃ³n comenzarÃ¡ a transmitir el archivo al otro nodo. El nodo de iniciaciÃ³n pasarÃ¡ a travÃ©s de los archivos que se enviarÃ¡n al otro nodo;Cada transmisiÃ³n de archivo estÃ¡ precedida por el comando de archivo entrante con los parÃ¡metros apropiados. Archivo de Ã­ndice: una vez que el nodo de indexaciÃ³n ha completado el proceso de indexaciÃ³n del conjunto de archivos, debe devolver el Ã­ndice resultante al nodo de iniciaciÃ³n. El Ã­ndice se compone de mÃºltiples archivos, que existen en el sistema de archivos del nodo de indexaciÃ³n. Al igual que con el comando de archivo entrante, el nodo de indexaciÃ³n transmite cada archivo de Ã­ndice despuÃ©s de enviar un comando de archivo de Ã­ndice. El comando de archivo de Ã­ndice tiene dos parÃ¡metros: el primero es el nombre del Ã­ndice, y el segundo es el tamaÃ±o del archivo en bytes. Enviar Complete: al enviar los conjuntos de archivos tanto para el Ã­ndice como para los archivos que se indexarÃ¡n, el nodo debe notificar al nodo correspondiente cuando el proceso estÃ© completo. Una vez que el nodo de iniciaciÃ³n estÃ© terminado de enviar el conjunto de documentos a indexar, luego enviarÃ¡ un comando Enviar un comando completo que indique al nodo de indexaciÃ³n que no hay mÃ¡s archivos y que el nodo puede continuar indexando los archivos. En el caso de que el nodo iniciado que envÃ­e los archivos de Ã­ndice, el nodo de indexaciÃ³n completarÃ¡ la transferencia con el comando Enviar el comando completo que indica al nodo de iniciaciÃ³n que no hay mÃ¡s archivos de Ã­ndice que se enviarÃ¡n y el nodo de iniciaciÃ³n puede ensamblar esos archivos de Ã­ndice enEl Ã­ndice principal. El nodecontroller es responsable de configurar conexiones con nodos en el estado inactivo para distribuir el proceso de indexaciÃ³n. Usando JXTA [5], el controlador de nodo obtendrÃ¡ un conjunto de nodos. Este conjunto de nodos se itera y cada uno se envÃ­a al comando de consulta inactiva. Luego se recogen los nodos que responden con inactivo. El conjunto de nodos inactivos incluye el nodo que inicia el proceso de indexaciÃ³n distribuido, denominado nodo local. Una vez que se obtiene la colecciÃ³n de nodos inactivos, el nodo actualiza el conjunto de controladores y divide uniformemente el conjunto de documentos que se indexarÃ¡n. Por ejemplo, si hay 100 documentos y 10 nodos (incluido el nodo local), cada nodo tendrÃ¡ 10 documentos para indexar. Para cada nodo de indexaciÃ³n se crea una instancia del objeto FileSender. El FileSender es consciente del conjunto de documentos de los que el nodo es responsable. Una vez que se ha creado un objeto FileSender para cada nodo, el NodeController espera a que se complete cada FileSender. Cuando los objetos de FileSender hayan completado, el nodecontroller tomarÃ¡ los Ã­ndices resultantes de 175 cada nodo y los pasarÃ¡ a una instancia del IndexCompiler, que mantiene el Ã­ndice y la lista de los estudiantes de archivos. Una vez que el IndexCompiler haya completado, volverÃ¡ al estado inactivo y activarÃ¡ el escÃ¡ner de directorio para monitorear el conjunto de documentos de propiedad local para los cambios que pueden requerir reintegraciÃ³n. El NodeIndexer es responsable de recibir documentos que se le envÃ­en al nodo iniciador y luego indexarlos usando el motor Lucene [7]. Una vez que se completa la indexaciÃ³n, el Ã­ndice resultante se transmite de regreso al nodo de iniciaciÃ³n, asÃ­ como se compila en el Ã­ndice local de los nodos indexadores. Antes de iniciar el proceso de indexaciÃ³n, debe enviarse un mensaje de consulta inactiva. Este es el primer comando que configura el proceso de indexaciÃ³n. El nodo indexador determinarÃ¡ si se considera inactivo segÃºn el uso actual de la CPU. Como se describe en la secciÃ³n Protocolo si el nodo no se usa y tiene un bajo porcentaje general de uso de la CPU, devolverÃ¡ inactivo al comando de consulta inactiva. Si el uso de la CPU de los nodos indexadores es superior al 50% durante una cantidad de tiempo especificada, se considera que estÃ¡ ocupado y responderÃ¡ al comando de consulta inactiva con ocupado. Si se determina que un nodo estÃ¡ ocupado, regresa a su estado de escucha esperando otra consulta inactiva de otro nodo iniciador. Si se determina que el nodo estÃ¡ inactivo, ingresarÃ¡ al estado donde recibirÃ¡ archivos del nodo de iniciaciÃ³n que es responsable de la indexaciÃ³n. Una vez que todos los archivos son recibidos por el nodo iniciador, indicado por un mensaje de envÃ­o completo, inicia una instancia del motor de indexaciÃ³n de Lucene. Los archivos se almacenan en un directorio temporal separado de los nodos documentos locales que es responsable de mantener un Ã­ndice de. El escritor de Lucene Index luego indexa todos los archivos transferidos. El Ã­ndice se almacena en la unidad dentro de un directorio temporal separado del Ã­ndice actual. DespuÃ©s de completar la indexaciÃ³n de los archivos, el nodo indexador ingresa al estado donde los archivos de Ã­ndice se envÃ­an de regreso al nodo de iniciaciÃ³n. El nodo indexador buce a travÃ©s de todos los archivos creados por Lucenes Indexwriter y los transmite al nodo iniciador. Una vez que se envÃ­an estos archivos, ese Ã­ndice se fusiona en el Ã­ndice completo de los nodos indexadores de los archivos existentes. Luego ingresa al estado inactivo donde luego escucharÃ¡ cualquier otro nodo que requiriera distribuir el proceso de indexaciÃ³n. El objeto FileSender es el equivalente de nodo iniciador del nodo indexador. Inicia la comunicaciÃ³n entre el nodo iniciador y el nodo que ayudarÃ¡ en la indexaciÃ³n distribuida. El nodo iniciador ejecuta muchas instancias del nodo de FileSender uno para el otro que ha determinado que estÃ¡ inactivo. Al instanciar el FileSender se pasa el nodo que es responsable de contactar y el conjunto de archivos que deben enviarse. El primer trabajo de FileSenders es enviar los archivos que deben ser indexados por el otro nodo inactivo. Los archivos se transmiten uno a la vez al otro nodo. EnvÃ­a cada archivo usando el comando de archivo entrante. Con ese comando envÃ­a el nombre del archivo que se envÃ­a y el tamaÃ±o en los bytes. Una vez que se hayan enviado todos los archivos, el FileSender envÃ­a el comando Enviar Complete. El FileSender crea una instancia de Lucenes IndexWriter y se prepara para crear el Ã­ndice en un directorio temporal en el sistema de archivos. El FileSender comenzarÃ¡ a recibir los archivos que se guardarÃ¡n dentro del Ã­ndice. Recibe un comando de archivo de Ã­ndice con el nombre de los archivos y el tamaÃ±o en los bytes. Este archivo se transmite en el directorio de Ã­ndice temporal en el nodo FileSender. DespuÃ©s de que se haya completado la transferencia de los archivos de Ã­ndice, el FileSender notifica la instancia del compilador de Ã­ndice de que estÃ¡ listo para combinar el Ã­ndice. Cada instancia del FileSender tiene su propia secciÃ³n Ãºnica de espacio temporal para almacenar el Ã­ndice que se ha transferido desde el nodo de indexaciÃ³n. Al notificar al IndexCompiler, tambiÃ©n pasarÃ¡ la ubicaciÃ³n de la ubicaciÃ³n del directorio de los servicios de archivos particular de ese Ã­ndice.4. DistribuciÃ³n de pares Apocrita utiliza un modelo de distribuciÃ³n de igual a igual para distribuir archivos. Los archivos se distribuyen Ãºnicamente de un nodo de servicio a un nodo cliente sin tener en cuenta la disponibilidad de piezas de archivos de otros clientes en la red. Esto significa que las transferencias de archivo serÃ¡n rÃ¡pidas y eficientes y no deberÃ­an afectar severamente la usabilidad de servir nodos desde el punto de vista de un usuario local. El marco JXTA [5] se usa para implementar la funcionalidad entre pares. Esto se ha decidido debido a la lÃ­nea de infracciÃ³n extremadamente corta del proyecto que nos permite aprovechar mÃ¡s de cinco aÃ±os de pruebas y desarrollo y apoyo de muchas organizaciones grandes que emplean a JXTA en sus propios productos. No nos preocupa ningÃºn problema potencial de calidad porque se considera que JXTA es el marco de igual a igual mÃ¡s maduro y estable disponible. Usando la terminologÃ­a JXTA, hay tres tipos de pares utilizados en la clasificaciÃ³n de nodos. Los pares de borde son tÃ­picamente nodos de bajo ancho de banda y no dedicados. Debido a estas caracterÃ­sticas, los compaÃ±eros de borde no se usan con Apocrita. Los pares de retransmisiÃ³n suelen ser nodos dedicados de mayor ancho de banda. Esta es la clasificaciÃ³n de todos los nodos en la red Apocrita y, como tal, son la clasificaciÃ³n predeterminada utilizada. Los pares de encuentro se utilizan para coordinar el paso de mensajes entre nodos en la red Apocrita. Esto significa que se requiere un mÃ­nimo de un par de la cita por subred.4.1 Descubrimiento de pares El subsistema del servidor Apocrita utiliza el Protocolo de descubrimiento de pares JXTA (PDP) para encontrar pares participantes dentro de la red como se muestra en la Figura 2. Figura 2. Proceso de descubrimiento por pares de Apocrita.176 El PDP escucha anuncios de pares de otros nodos en el Swarm de Apocrita. Si se detecta un anuncio de pares, el servidor intentarÃ¡ unirse al grupo de pares y comenzar a contribuir activamente a la red. Si el servicio Discovery no encuentra pares, el servidor crearÃ¡ un nuevo grupo de pares y comenzarÃ¡ a anunciar este grupo de pares. Este nuevo grupo de pares se anunciarÃ¡ periÃ³dicamente en la red;Cualquier nuevo compaÃ±ero que se una a la red se adjuntarÃ¡ a este grupo de pares. Una clara ventaja de usar el JXTA PDP es que Apocrita no tiene que ser sensible a matices de redes particulares, como la unidad de transmisiÃ³n mÃ¡xima (MTU). AdemÃ¡s, Apocrita no tiene que admitir mÃ©todos de entrega de paquetes de uno a muchos como multidifusiÃ³n y, en cambio, puede confiar en JXTA para este soporte.4.2 OperaciÃ³n de consulta de Ã­ndice Todos los nodos en el enjambre de Apocrita tienen una copia completa y actualizada del Ã­ndice de red almacenado localmente. Esto hace que la consulta del Ã­ndice de resultados de bÃºsqueda sea trivial. A diferencia del protocolo Gnutella, una consulta no tiene que propagarse en toda la red. Esto tambiÃ©n significa que el tiempo para devolver los resultados de la consulta es muy rÃ¡pido, mucho mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido que los protocolos que dependen de los nodos en la red para pasar la consulta por toda la red y luego esperar resultados. Esto se demuestra en la Figura 3. Figura 3. OperaciÃ³n de consulta de Apocrita. Cada documento en el enjambre tiene un nÃºmero de identificaciÃ³n de documento Ãºnico (ID). Un nodo consultarÃ¡ el Ã­ndice y un resultado se devolverÃ¡ con el nÃºmero de identificaciÃ³n del documento, asÃ­ como una lista de pares con una copia de la ID de documento coincidente. Entonces es responsabilidad del par de bÃºsqueda contactar a los pares en la lista para negociar la transferencia de archivos entre el cliente y el servidor.5. ImplementaciÃ³n de prototipo Apocrita utiliza el marco Lucene [7], que es un proyecto en desarrollo de Apache Software Foundation. Apache Lucene es una biblioteca de motor de bÃºsqueda de texto de alto rendimiento y con todas las funciones escrita completamente en Java. En la implementaciÃ³n actual, Apocrita solo es capaz de indexar documentos de texto plano. Apocrita usa el marco JXTA [5] como una biblioteca de transporte de igual a igual entre nodos. JXTA se usa para pasar mensajes y archivos entre nodos en la red de bÃºsqueda. Al usar JXTA, Apocrita aprovecha un mecanismo de transporte de pares confiable y probado. Utiliza la instalaciÃ³n de tuberÃ­as para pasar mensajes y archivos entre nodos. La instalaciÃ³n de tuberÃ­as proporciona muchos tipos diferentes de anuncios de tuberÃ­as. Esto incluye una tuberÃ­a de unidifusiÃ³n no garantizada, una tuberÃ­a de unidifusiÃ³n segura y una tuberÃ­a no garantizada propagada. El paso de mensajes se usa para pasar mensajes de estado entre nodos para ayudar a indexaciÃ³n, bÃºsqueda y recuperaciÃ³n. Por ejemplo, un nodo que intenta encontrar un nodo inactivo para participar en la indexaciÃ³n consultarÃ¡ nodos a travÃ©s de la instalaciÃ³n de mensajes. Los nodos inactivos responderÃ¡n con un mensaje de estado para indicar que estÃ¡n disponibles para comenzar a indexaciÃ³n. El paso de archivos se usa dentro de Apocrita para la transferencia de archivos. DespuÃ©s de que se haya buscado y ubicado un archivo dentro del grupo de pares, se abrirÃ¡ un socket JXTA y se realizarÃ¡ la transferencia de archivos. Un socket JXTA es similar a un enchufe Java estÃ¡ndar, sin embargo, un socket JXTA utiliza tuberÃ­as JXTA en el transporte de red subyacente. El paso de archivos utiliza una tuberÃ­a de unidifusiÃ³n no garantizada para transferir datos. El paso de archivos tambiÃ©n se usa dentro de Apocrita para la transferencia de Ã­ndice. La transferencia de Ã­ndice funciona exactamente como una transferencia de archivo. De hecho, la transferencia de Ã­ndice en realidad pasa el Ã­ndice como un archivo. Sin embargo, hay una diferencia clave entre la transferencia de archivos y la transferencia de Ã­ndice. En el caso de la transferencia de archivos, se crea un socket entre solo dos nodos. En el caso de la transferencia de Ã­ndice, se debe crear un socket entre todos los nodos en la red para pasar el Ã­ndice, lo que permite que todos los nodos tengan un Ã­ndice completo y completo de toda la red. Para facilitar esta transferencia de manera eficiente, la transferencia de Ã­ndice utilizarÃ¡ una tuberÃ­a propagada no garantizada para comunicarse con todos los nodos en la red Apocrita.6. EvaluaciÃ³n del rendimiento Es difÃ­cil comparar objetivamente los resultados obtenidos a travÃ©s de Apocrita porque actualmente no hay otro sistema disponible con los mismos objetivos que Apocrita. Sin embargo, hemos evaluado el rendimiento de las secciones crÃ­ticas del sistema. Se determinÃ³ que las secciones crÃ­ticas son los procesos que son los mÃ¡s intensivos en el tiempo. La evaluaciÃ³n se completÃ³ en computadoras de laboratorio estÃ¡ndar en una LAN Ethernet de 100 MB/S;Las mÃ¡quinas ejecutan Windows XP con una CPU Pentium 4 que se ejecuta a 2.4GHz con 512 MB de RAM. El tiempo de indexaciÃ³n se ha ejecutado contra ambos: The Time Magazine Collection [8], que contiene 432 documentos y 83 consultas y sus resultados mÃ¡s relevantes, y la colecciÃ³n NPL [8] que tiene un total de 11,429 documentos y 93 consultas con resultados esperados. Cada documento varÃ­a en tamaÃ±o entre 4KB y 8KB. Como lo demuestra la Figura 4, el nÃºmero de nodos involucrados en el proceso de indexaciÃ³n afecta el tiempo necesario para completar los procesos de indexaciÃ³n a veces incluso drÃ¡sticamente. Figura 4. Nodo vs. Tiempo de Ã­ndice. La diferencia en pasar de un nodo de indexaciÃ³n a dos nodos de indexaciÃ³n es la mÃ¡s drÃ¡stica y equivale a un tiempo de indexaciÃ³n 37% mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido que un solo nodo de indexaciÃ³n. La diferente entre dos 177 nodos de indexaciÃ³n y tres nodos de indexaciÃ³n sigue siendo significativo y representa un tiempo de 16% mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido que dos nodos de indexaciÃ³n. A medida que aumenta el nÃºmero de nodos de indexaciÃ³n, los resultados son menos dramÃ¡ticos. Esto se puede atribuir a la sobrecarga de tiempo asociada con la indexaciÃ³n de muchos nodos. El tiempo necesario para comunicarse con un nodo es constante, por lo que a medida que aumenta el nÃºmero de nodos, esta constante se vuelve mÃ¡s frecuente. AdemÃ¡s, la complejidad de unir los resultados de la indexaciÃ³n es una operaciÃ³n compleja y se complica aÃºn mÃ¡s a medida que aumenta el nÃºmero de nodos de indexaciÃ³n. El rendimiento del socket tambiÃ©n es una parte muy importante de Apocrita. Los puntos de referencia se realizaron utilizando un archivo de 65 MB en un sistema con el cliente y el servidor que se ejecuta localmente. Esto se hizo para aislar posibles problemas de red. Aunque menos drÃ¡sticos, se mostraron resultados similares cuando el cliente y el servidor se ejecutan en hardware independiente. Para mitigar posibles errores inesperados, cada prueba se ejecutÃ³ 10 veces. Figura 5. Sockets Java vs. Sockets JXTA. Como demuestra la Figura 5, el rendimiento de los enchufes JXTA es abismal en comparaciÃ³n con el rendimiento de los enchufes Java estÃ¡ndar. La tasa de transferencia mÃ­nima obtenida usando enchufes Java es 81,945 kb/s, mientras que el evaluador de transferencia mÃ­nimo obtenido usando enchufes JXTA es mucho mÃ¡s bajo a 3, 805kb/s. El evaluador de transferencia mÃ¡ximo que se obtiene con enchufes Java es 97,412kb/s, mientras que la tasa de transferencia mÃ¡xima obtenida usando enchufes JXTA es de 5,530 kb/s. Finalmente, la tasa de transferencia promedio que usa enchufes Java es de 87,540 kb/s, mientras que la tasa de transferencia promedio que usa enchufes JXTA es de 4,293 kb/s. El principal problema encontrado en estos puntos de referencia es que el mecanismo de transporte de red subyacente no funciona de manera tan rÃ¡pida o eficiente como se esperaba. Para obtener un aumento de rendimiento, el marco JXTA necesita ser sustituido con un enfoque mÃ¡s tradicional. El tiempo de indexaciÃ³n tambiÃ©n es un cuello de botella y deberÃ¡ mejorarse para que se mejore la calidad general de Apocrita.7. Trabajo relacionado Varios sistemas P2P descentralizados [1, 2, 3] existen hoy que Apocrita presenta parte de su funcionalidad. Sin embargo, Apocrita tambiÃ©n tiene caracterÃ­sticas Ãºnicas de bÃºsqueda e indexaciÃ³n de novelas que hacen que este sistema sea Ãºnico. Por ejemplo, Majestic-12 [4] es un proyecto de bÃºsqueda e indexaciÃ³n distribuido diseÃ±ado para buscar en Internet. Cada usuario instalarÃ­a un cliente, que es responsable de indexar una parte de la web. Un Ã¡rea central para consultar el Ã­ndice estÃ¡ disponible en la pÃ¡gina web Majestic-12. El Ã­ndice en sÃ­ no se distribuye, solo se distribuye el acto de indexaciÃ³n. El aspecto de indexaciÃ³n distribuido de este proyecto mÃ¡s relata de cerca los objetivos de Apocrita. Yacy [6] es una aplicaciÃ³n de bÃºsqueda web de igual a igual. Yacy consiste en un rastreador web, un indexador, un motor de base de datos incorporado y un protocolo de intercambio de Ã­ndice P2P. Yacy estÃ¡ diseÃ±ado para mantener un Ã­ndice distribuido de Internet. UtilizÃ³ una tabla hash distribuida (DHT) para mantener el Ã­ndice. El nodo local se usa para consultar, pero todos los resultados que se devuelven son accesibles en Internet. Yacy usÃ³ muchos compaÃ±eros y DHT para mantener un Ã­ndice distribuido. Apocrita tambiÃ©n utilizarÃ¡ un Ã­ndice distribuido en futuras implementaciones y puede beneficiarse al usar una implementaciÃ³n de un DHT. Sin embargo, Yacy estÃ¡ diseÃ±ado como un motor de bÃºsqueda web y, como tal, resuelve un problema muy diferente al de Apocrita.8. Conclusiones y trabajos futuros presentamos Apocrita, un sistema distribuido de bÃºsqueda e indexaciÃ³n P2P destinado a usuarios de redes en una intranet. Puede ayudar a las organizaciones sin servidor de archivos de red o infraestructura de red necesaria para compartir documentos. Elimina la necesidad de que los documentos se compartan manualmente entre los usuarios mientras se editan y reducen la posibilidad de distribuir versiones conflictivas. Se ha construido un prototipo de prueba de concepto, pero los resultados de medir el mecanismo de transporte de red y el tiempo de indexaciÃ³n no fueron tan impresionantes como se imaginÃ³ inicialmente. A pesar de estas deficiencias, la experiencia obtenida del diseÃ±o e implementaciÃ³n de Apocrita nos ha dado mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n sobre la construcciÃ³n de sistemas distribuidos desafiantes. Para el trabajo futuro, Apocrita tendrÃ¡ un modelo de distribuciÃ³n de contenido inteligente en el que una sola instancia de un archivo puede replicarse de manera inteligente y transparente en toda la red para garantizar que una copia de cada archivo importante siempre estÃ© disponible, independientemente de la disponibilidad de nodos especÃ­ficos en la red.. AdemÃ¡s, planeamos integrar un sistema de control de revisiÃ³n en la parte de distribuciÃ³n de contenido de Apocrita para que los usuarios puedan tener la capacidad de actualizar un archivo existente que encontraron y que mantengan la antigua revisiÃ³n y se propague la nueva revisiÃ³n. Finalmente, la implementaciÃ³n actual tiene algunos gastos generales y redundancia debido al hecho de que todo el Ã­ndice se mantiene en cada nodo individual, planeamos diseÃ±ar un Ã­ndice distribuido.9.

        "A node will be able to contact each node that contains a unique portion of the index.",
        "In addition, each node has a separate local index of its own documents.",
        "But as discussed later, in the current implementation, each node has a copy of the entire index.",

        "The receiving node will respond with either a BUSY or IDLE command.",
        "If the IDLE command is received, the initiating node will add the responding node to a list of available distributed indexing helpers.",
        "In the case of a BUSY command being received, the responding node is ignored.",
        "BUSY: Once a node received an IDL QUERY, it will determine whether it can be considered a candidate for distributed indexing.",
        "This determination is based on the overall CPU usage of the node.",
        "If the node is using most of its CPU for other processes, the node will respond to the IDLE QUERY with a BUSY command.",
        "IDLE: As with the case of the BUSY response, the node receiving the IDLE QUERY will determine its eligibility for distributed indexing.",
        "To be considered a candidate for distributed indexing, the overall CPU usage must be at a minimum to all for dedicated indexing of the distributed documents.",
        "If this is the case, the node will respond with an IDLE command.",
        "INCOMING FILE: Once the initiating node assembles a set of idle nodes to assist with the distributed indexing, it will divide the documents to be sent to the nodes.",
        "To do this, it sends an INCOMING FILE message, which contains the name of the file as well as the size in bytes.",
        "After the INCOMING FILE command has been sent, the initiating node will begin to stream the file to the other node.",
        "The initiating node will loop through the files that are to be sent to the other node; each file stream being preceded by the INCOMING FILE command with the appropriate parameters.",
        "INDEX FILE: Once the indexing node has completed the indexing process of the set of files, it must send the resultant index back to the initiating node.",
        "The index is comprised of multiple files, which exist on the file system of the indexing node.",
        "As with the INCOMING FILE command, the indexing node streams each index file after sending an INDEX FILE command.",
        "The INDEX FILE command has two parameters: the first being the name of the index, and the second is the size of the file in bytes.",
        "SEND COMPLETE: When sending the sets of files for both the index and the files to be indexed, the node must notify the corresponding node when the process is complete.",
        "Once the initiating node is finished sending the set of documents to be indexed, it will then send a SEND COMPLETE command indicating to the indexing node that there are no more files and the node can proceed with indexing the files.",
        "In the case of the initiating node sending the index files, the indexing node will complete the transfer with the SEND COMPLETE command indicating to the initiating node that there are no more index files to be sent and the initiating node can then assemble those index files into the main index.",
        "The NodeController is responsible for setting up connections with nodes in the idle state to distribute the indexing process.",
        "Using JXTA [5], the node controller will obtain a set of nodes.",
        "This set of nodes is iterated and each one is sent the IDLE QUERY command.",
        "The nodes that respond with idle are then collected.",
        "The set of idle nodes includes the node initiating the distributed indexing process, referred to as the local node.",
        "Once the collection of idle nodes is obtained, the node updates the set of controllers and evenly divides the set of documents that are to be indexed.",
        "For example, if there are 100 documents and 10 nodes (including the local node) then each node will have 10 documents to index.",
        "For each indexing node an instance of the FileSender object is created.",
        "The FileSender is aware of the set of documents that node is responsible for.",
        "Once a FileSender object has been created for each node, the NodeController waits for each FileSender to complete.",
        "When the FileSender objects have completed the NodeController will take the resultant indexes from 175 each node and pass them to an instance of the IndexCompiler, which maintains the index and the list of FileSenders.",
        "Once the IndexCompiler has completed it will return to the idle state and activate the directory scanner to monitor the locally owned set of documents for changes that may require reindexing.",
        "The NodeIndexer is responsible for receiving documents sent to it by the initiating node and then indexing them using the Lucene engine [7].",
        "Once the indexing is complete the resulting index is streamed back to the initiating node as well as compiled in the indexer nodes own local index.",
        "Before initiating the indexing process it must be sent an IDLE QUERY message.",
        "This is the first command that sets off the indexing process.",
        "The indexer node will determine whether it is considered idle based on the current CPU usage.",
        "As outlined in the protocol section if the node is not being used and has a low overall CPU usage percentage it will return IDLE to the IDLE QUERY command.",
        "If the indexer nodes CPU usage is above 50% for a specified amount of time it is then considered to be busy and will respond to the IDLE QUERY command with BUSY.",
        "If a node is determined busy it returns to its listening state waiting for another IDLE QUERY from another initiating node.",
        "If the node is determined to be idle it will enter the state where it will receive files from the initiating node that it is responsible for indexing.",
        "Once all of the files are received by the initiating node, indicated by a SEND COMPLETE message, it starts an instance of the Lucene indexing engine.",
        "The files are stored in a temporary directory separate from the nodes local documents that it is responsible for maintaining an index of.",
        "The Lucene index writer then indexes all of the transferred files.",
        "The index is stored on the drive within a temporary directory separate from the current index.",
        "After the indexing of the files completes the indexer node enters the state where the index files are sent back to the initiating node.",
        "The indexer node loops through all of the files created by Lucenes IndexWriter and streams them to the initiating node.",
        "Once these files are sent back that index is then merged into the indexer nodes own full index of the existing files.",
        "It then enters the idle state where it will then listen for any other nodes that required distributing the indexing process.",
        "The FileSender object is the initiating node equivalent of the indexer node.",
        "It initiates the communication between the initiating node and the node that will assist in the distributed indexing.",
        "The initiating node runs many instances of the FileSender node one for each other node it has determined to be idle.",
        "Upon instantiation of the FileSender it is passed the node that it is responsible for contacting and the set of files that must be sent.",
        "The FileSenders first job is to send the files that are to be indexed by the other idle node.",
        "The files are streamed one at a time to the other node.",
        "It sends each file using the INCOMING FILE command.",
        "With that command it sends the name of the file being sent and the size in bytes.",
        "Once all files have been sent the FileSender sends the SEND COMPLETE command.",
        "The FileSender creates an instance of Lucenes IndexWriter and prepares to create the index in a temporary directory on the file system.",
        "The FileSender will begin to receive the files that are to be saved within the index.",
        "It receives an INDEX FILE command with the name of the files and the size in bytes.",
        "This file is then streamed into the temporary index directory on the FileSender node.",
        "After the transfer of the index files has been completed the FileSender notifies the instance of the index compiler that it is ready to combine the index.",
        "Each instance of the FileSender has its own unique section of temporary space to store the index that has been transferred back from the indexing node.",
        "When notifying the IndexCompiler it will also pass the location of the particular FileSenders directory location of that index. 4.",
        "PEER-TO-PEER DISTRIBUTION Apocrita uses a peer-to-peer distribution model in order to distribute files.",
        "Files are distributed solely from a serving node to a client node without regard for the availability of file pieces from other clients in the network.",
        "This means that the file transfers will be fast and efficient and should not severely affect the usability of serving nodes from the point of view of a local user.",
        "The JXTA framework [5] is used in order to implement peer-to-peer functionality.",
        "This has been decided due to the extremely shorttimeline of the project which allows us to take advantage of over five years of testing and development and support from many large organizations employing JXTA in their own products.",
        "We are not concerned with any potential quality problems because JXTA is considered to be the most mature and stable peer-to-peer framework available.",
        "Using JXTA terminology, there are three types of peers used in node classification.",
        "Edge peers are typically low-bandwidth, non-dedicated nodes.",
        "Due to these characteristics, edge peers are not used with Apocrita.",
        "Relay peers are typically higher-bandwidth, dedicated nodes.",
        "This is the classification of all nodes in the Apocrita network, and, as such, are the default classification used.",
        "Rendezvous peers are used to coordinate message passing between nodes in the Apocrita network.",
        "This means that a minimum of one rendezvous peer per subnet is required. 4.1 Peer Discovery The Apocrita server subsystem uses the JXTA Peer Discovery Protocol (PDP) in order to find participating peers within the network as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Figure 2.",
        "Apocrita peer discovery process. 176 The PDP listens for peer advertisements from other nodes in the Apocrita swarm.",
        "If a peer advertisement is detected, the server will attempt to join the peer group and start actively contributing to the network.",
        "If no peers are found by the discovery service, the server will create a new peer group and start advertising this peer group.",
        "This new peer group will be periodically advertised on the network; any new peers joining the network will attach to this peer group.",
        "A distinct advantage of using the JXTA PDP is that Apocrita does not have to be sensitive to particular networking nuances such as Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).",
        "In addition, Apocrita does not have to support one-to-many packet delivery methods such as multicast and instead can rely on JXTA for this support. 4.2 Index Query Operation All nodes in the Apocrita swarm have a complete and up-to-date copy of the network index stored locally.",
        "This makes querying the index for search results trivial.",
        "Unlike the Gnutella protocol, a query does not have to propagate throughout the network.",
        "This also means that the time to return query results is very fast - much faster than protocols that rely on nodes in the network to pass the query throughout the network and then wait for results.",
        "This is demonstrated in Figure 3.",
        "Figure 3.",
        "Apocrita query operation.",
        "Each document in the swarm has a unique document identification number (ID).",
        "A node will query the index and a result will be returned with both the document ID number as well as a list of peers with a copy of the matched document ID.",
        "It is then the responsibility of the searching peer to contact the peers in the list to negotiate file transfer between the client and server. 5.",
        "PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION Apocrita uses the Lucene framework [7], which is a project under development by the Apache Software Foundation.",
        "Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java.",
        "In the current implementation, Apocrita is only capable of indexing plain text documents.",
        "Apocrita uses the JXTA framework [5] as a peer-to-peer transport library between nodes.",
        "JXTA is used to pass both messages and files between nodes in the search network.",
        "By using JXTA, Apocrita takes advantage of a reliable, and proven peer-to-peer transport mechanism.",
        "It uses the pipe facility in order to pass messages and files between nodes.",
        "The pipe facility provides many different types of pipe advertisements.",
        "This includes an unsecured unicast pipe, a secured unicast pipe, and a propagated unsecured pipe.",
        "Message passing is used to pass status messages between nodes in order to aid in indexing, searching, and retrieval.",
        "For example, a node attempting to find an idle node to participate in indexing will query nodes via the message facility.",
        "Idle nodes will reply with a status message to indicate they are available to start indexing.",
        "File passing is used within Apocrita for file transfer.",
        "After a file has been searched for and located within the peer group, a JXTA socket will be opened and file transfer will take place.",
        "A JXTA socket is similar to a standard Java socket, however a JXTA socket uses JXTA pipes in underlying network transport.",
        "File passing uses an unsecured unicast pipe in order to transfer data.",
        "File passing is also used within Apocrita for index transfer.",
        "Index transfer works exactly like a file transfer.",
        "In fact, the index transfer actually passes the index as a file.",
        "However, there is one key difference between file transfer and index transfer.",
        "In the case of file transfer, a socket is created between only two nodes.",
        "In the case of index transfer, a socket must be created between all nodes in the network in order to pass the index, which allows for all nodes to have a full and complete index of the entire network.",
        "In order to facilitate this transfer efficiently, index transfer will use an unsecured propagated pipe to communicate with all nodes in the Apocrita network. 6.",
        "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION It is difficult to objectively benchmark the results obtained through Apocrita because there is no other system currently available with the same goals as Apocrita.",
        "We have, however, evaluated the performance of the critical sections of the system.",
        "The critical sections were determined to be the processes that are the most time intensive.",
        "The evaluation was completed on standard lab computers on a 100Mb/s Ethernet LAN; the machines run Windows XP with a Pentium 4 CPU running at 2.4GHz with 512 MB of RAM.",
        "The indexing time has been run against both: the Time Magazine collection [8], which contains 432 documents and 83 queries and their most relevant results, and the NPL collection [8] that has a total of 11,429 documents and 93 queries with expected results.",
        "Each document ranges in size between 4KB and 8KB.",
        "As Figure 4 demonstrates, the number of nodes involved in the indexing process affects the time taken to complete the indexing processsometimes even drastically.",
        "Figure 4.",
        "Node vs. index time.",
        "The difference in going from one indexing node to two indexing nodes is the most drastic and equates to an indexing time 37% faster than a single indexing node.",
        "The different between two 177 indexing nodes and three indexing nodes is still significant and represents a 16% faster time than two indexing nodes.",
        "As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic.",
        "This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing.",
        "The time needed to communicate with a node is constant, so as the number of nodes increases, this constant becomes more prevalent.",
        "Also, the complexity of joining the indexing results is a complex operation and is complicated further as the number of indexing nodes increases.",
        "Socket performance is also a very important part of Apocrita.",
        "Benchmarks were performed using a 65MB file on a system with both the client and server running locally.",
        "This was done to isolate possible network issues.",
        "Although less drastic, similar results were shown when the client and server run on independent hardware.",
        "In order to mitigate possible unexpected errors, each test was run 10 times.",
        "Figure 5.",
        "Java sockets vs. JXTA sockets.",
        "As Figure 5 demonstrates, the performance of JXTA sockets is abysmal as compared to the performance of standard Java sockets.",
        "The minimum transfer rate obtained using Java sockets is 81,945KB/s while the minimum transfer rater obtained using JXTA sockets is much lower at 3, 805KB/s.",
        "The maximum transfer rater obtain using Java sockets is 97,412KB/s while the maximum transfer rate obtained using JXTA sockets is 5,530KB/s.",
        "Finally, the average transfer rate using Java sockets is 87,540KB/s while the average transfer rate using JXTA sockets is 4,293KB/s.",
        "The major problem found in these benchmarks is that the underlying network transport mechanism does not perform as quickly or efficiently as expected.",
        "In order to garner a performance increase, the JXTA framework needs to be substituted with a more traditional approach.",
        "The indexing time is also a bottleneck and will need to be improved for the overall quality of Apocrita to be improved. 7.",
        "RELATED WORK Several decentralized P2P systems [1, 2, 3] exist today that Apocrita features some of their functionality.",
        "However, Apocrita also has unique novel searching and indexing features that make this system unique.",
        "For example, Majestic-12 [4] is a distributed search and indexing project designed for searching the Internet.",
        "Each user would install a client, which is responsible for indexing a portion of the web.",
        "A central area for querying the index is available on the Majestic-12 web page.",
        "The index itself is not distributed, only the act of indexing is distributed.",
        "The distributed indexing aspect of this project most closely relates Apocrita goals.",
        "YaCy [6] is a peer-to-peer web search application.",
        "YaCy consists of a web crawler, an indexer, a built-in database engine, and a p2p index exchange protocol.",
        "YaCy is designed to maintain a distributed index of the Internet.",
        "It used a distributed hash table (DHT) to maintain the index.",
        "The local node is used to query but all results that are returned are accessible on the Internet.",
        "YaCy used many peers and DHT to maintain a distributed index.",
        "Apocrita will also use a distributed index in future implementations and may benefit from using an implementation of a DHT.",
        "YaCy however, is designed as a web search engine and, as such solves a much different problem than Apocrita. 8.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We presented Apocrita, a distributed P2P searching and indexing system intended for network users on an Intranet.",
        "It can help organizations with no network file server or necessary network infrastructure to share documents.",
        "It eliminates the need for documents to be manually shared among users while being edited and reduce the possibility of conflicting versions being distributed.",
        "A proof of concept prototype has been constructed, but the results from measuring the network transport mechanism and the indexing time were not as impressive as initially envisioned.",
        "Despite these shortcomings, the experience gained from the design and implementation of Apocrita has given us more insight into building challenging distributed systems.",
        "For future work, Apocrita will have a smart content distribution model in which a single instance of a file can intelligently and transparently replicate throughout the network to ensure a copy of every important file will always be available regardless of the availability of specific nodes in the network.",
        "In addition, we plan to integrate a revision control system into the content distribution portion of Apocrita so that users could have the ability to update an existing file that they found and have the old revision maintained and the new revision propagated.",
        "Finally, the current implementation has some overhead and redundancy due to the fact that the entire index is maintained on each individual node, we plan to design a distributed index. 9.",

                "File passing is used within Apocrita for file transfer.",
                "After a file has been searched for and located within the peer group, a JXTA socket will be opened and file transfer will take place.",
                "A JXTA socket is similar to a standard Java socket, however a JXTA socket uses JXTA pipes in underlying network transport.",
                "File passing uses an unsecured unicast pipe in order to transfer data.",
                "File passing is also used within Apocrita for index transfer.",
                "Index transfer works exactly like a file transfer.",
                "In fact, the index transfer actually passes the index as a file.",

                "In the case of index transfer, a socket must be created between all nodes in the network in order to pass the index, which allows for all nodes to have a full and complete index of the entire network.",

                "As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic.",
                "This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing.",

                "Also, the complexity of joining the indexing results is a complex operation and is complicated further as the number of indexing nodes increases.",
                "Socket performance is also a very important part of Apocrita.",
                "Benchmarks were performed using a 65MB file on a system with both the client and server running locally.",
                "This was done to isolate possible network issues.",
                "Although less drastic, similar results were shown when the client and server run on independent hardware.",

                "A distinct advantage of using the JXTA PDP is that Apocrita does not have to be sensitive to particular networking nuances such as Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).",
                "In addition, Apocrita does not have to support one-to-many packet delivery methods such as multicast and instead can rely on JXTA for this support. 4.2 Index Query Operation All nodes in the Apocrita swarm have a complete and up-to-date copy of the network index stored locally.",
                "This makes querying the index for search results trivial.",
                "Unlike the Gnutella protocol, a query does not have to propagate throughout the network.",
                "This also means that the time to return query results is very fast - much faster than protocols that rely on nodes in the network to pass the query throughout the network and then wait for results.",

                "Each <br>document</br> in the swarm has a unique <br>document</br> identification number (ID).",
                "A node will query the index and a result will be returned with both the <br>document</br> ID number as well as a list of peers with a copy of the matched <br>document</br> ID.",
                "It is then the responsibility of the searching peer to contact the peers in the list to negotiate file transfer between the client and server. 5.",

                "In the current implementation, Apocrita is only capable of indexing plain text documents.",

                "JXTA is used to pass both messages and files between nodes in the search network.",
                "By using JXTA, Apocrita takes advantage of a reliable, and proven peer-to-peer transport mechanism.",
                "It uses the pipe facility in order to pass messages and files between nodes.",
                "The pipe facility provides many different types of pipe advertisements.",
                "This includes an unsecured unicast pipe, a secured unicast pipe, and a propagated unsecured pipe.",
                "Message passing is used to pass status messages between nodes in order to aid in indexing, searching, and retrieval.",
                "For example, a node attempting to find an idle node to participate in indexing will query nodes via the message facility.",
                "Idle nodes will reply with a status message to indicate they are available to start indexing.",
                "File passing is used within Apocrita for file transfer.",
                "After a file has been searched for and located within the peer group, a JXTA socket will be opened and file transfer will take place.",
                "A JXTA socket is similar to a standard Java socket, however a JXTA socket uses JXTA pipes in underlying network transport.",
                "File passing uses an unsecured unicast pipe in order to transfer data.",
                "File passing is also used within Apocrita for index transfer.",
                "Index transfer works exactly like a file transfer.",
                "In fact, the index transfer actually passes the index as a file.",
                "However, there is one key difference between file transfer and index transfer.",
                "In the case of file transfer, a socket is created between only two nodes.",
                "In the case of index transfer, a socket must be created between all nodes in the network in order to pass the index, which allows for all nodes to have a full and complete index of the entire network.",
                "In order to facilitate this transfer efficiently, index transfer will use an unsecured propagated pipe to communicate with all nodes in the Apocrita network. 6.",
                "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION It is difficult to objectively benchmark the results obtained through Apocrita because there is no other system currently available with the same goals as Apocrita.",
                "We have, however, evaluated the performance of the critical sections of the system.",
                "The critical sections were determined to be the processes that are the most time intensive.",
                "The evaluation was completed on standard lab computers on a 100Mb/s Ethernet LAN; the machines run Windows XP with a Pentium 4 CPU running at 2.4GHz with 512 MB of RAM.",
                "The indexing time has been run against both: the Time Magazine collection [8], which contains 432 documents and 83 queries and their most relevant results, and the NPL collection [8] that has a total of 11,429 documents and 93 queries with expected results.",
                "Each <br>document</br> ranges in size between 4KB and 8KB.",

                "The different between two 177 indexing nodes and three indexing nodes is still significant and represents a 16% faster time than two indexing nodes.",
                "As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic.",
                "This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing.",
                "The time needed to communicate with a node is constant, so as the number of nodes increases, this constant becomes more prevalent.",
                "Also, the complexity of joining the indexing results is a complex operation and is complicated further as the number of indexing nodes increases.",
                "Socket performance is also a very important part of Apocrita.",
                "Benchmarks were performed using a 65MB file on a system with both the client and server running locally.",
                "This was done to isolate possible network issues.",
                "Although less drastic, similar results were shown when the client and server run on independent hardware.",
                "In order to mitigate possible unexpected errors, each test was run 10 times.",

                "Java sockets vs. JXTA sockets.",
                "As Figure 5 demonstrates, the performance of JXTA sockets is abysmal as compared to the performance of standard Java sockets.",
                "The minimum transfer rate obtained using Java sockets is 81,945KB/s while the minimum transfer rater obtained using JXTA sockets is much lower at 3, 805KB/s.",

                "It eliminates the need for documents to be manually shared among users while being edited and reduce the possibility of conflicting versions being distributed.",
                "A proof of concept prototype has been constructed, but the results from measuring the network transport mechanism and the indexing time were not as impressive as initially envisioned.",
                "Despite these shortcomings, the experience gained from the design and implementation of Apocrita has given us more insight into building challenging distributed systems.",
                "For future work, Apocrita will have a smart content distribution model in which a single instance of a file can intelligently and transparently replicate throughout the network to ensure a copy of every important file will always be available regardless of the availability of specific nodes in the network.",
                "In addition, we plan to integrate a revision control system into the content distribution portion of Apocrita so that users could have the ability to update an existing file that they found and have the old revision maintained and the new revision propagated.",
                "Finally, the current implementation has some overhead and redundancy due to the fact that the entire index is maintained on each individual node, we plan to design a distributed index. 9.",

                "As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic.",
                "This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing.",
                "The time needed to communicate with a node is constant, so as the number of nodes increases, this constant becomes more prevalent.",
                "Also, the complexity of joining the indexing results is a complex operation and is complicated further as the number of indexing nodes increases.",
                "Socket performance is also a very important part of Apocrita.",
                "Benchmarks were performed using a 65MB file on a system with both the client and server running locally.",

                "As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic.",
                "This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing.",
