Mahmoud Distributed Computing and Wireless & Telecommunications Technology University of Guelph-Humber Toronto, ON, M9W 5L7 Canada {jreyno04,rmcleo01,qmahmoud}@uoguelph.ca ABSTRACT Many organizations are required to author documents for various purposes, and such documents may need to be accessible by all member of the organization. This access may be needed for editing or simply viewing a document. In some cases these documents are shared between authors, via email, to be edited. This can easily cause incorrect version to be sent or conflicts created between multiple users trying to make amendments to a document. There may even be multiple different documents in the process of being edited. The user may be required to search for a particular document, which some search tools such as Google Desktop may be a solution for local documents but will not find a document on another users machine. Another problem arises when a document is made available on a users machine and that user is offline, in which case the document is no longer accessible. In this paper we present Apocrita, a revolutionary distributed P2P file sharing system for Intranets.

INTRODUCTION The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing paradigm is becoming a completely new form of mutual resource sharing over the Internet. With the increasingly common place broadband Internet access, P2P technology has finally become a viable way to share documents and media files. There are already programs on the market that enable P2P file sharing. These programs enable millions of users to share files among themselves. While the utilization of P2P clients is already a gigantic step forward compared to downloading files off websites, using such programs are not without their problems. The downloaded files still require a lot of manual management by the user. The user still needs to put the files in the proper directory, manage files with multiple versions, delete the files when they are no longer wanted. We strive to make the process of sharing documents within an Intranet easier. Many organizations are required to author documents for various purposes, and such documents may need to be accessible by all members of the organization. This access may be needed for editing or simply viewing a document. In some cases these documents are sent between authors, via email, to be edited. This can easily cause incorrect version to be sent or conflicts created between multiple users trying to make amendments to a document. There may even be multiple different documents in the process of being edited. The user may be required to search for a particular document, which some search tools such as Google Desktop may be a solution for local documents but will not find a document on another users machine. Furthermore, some organizations do not have a file sharing server or the necessary network infrastructure to enable one. In this paper we present Apocrita, which is a cost-effective distributed P2P file sharing system for such organizations. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present Apocrita. The distributed indexing mechanism and protocol are presented in Section 3. Section 4 presents the peer-topeer distribution model. A proof of concept prototype is presented in Section 5, and performance evaluations are discussed in Section 6. Related work is presented is Section 7, and finally conclusions and future work are discussed in Section 8. 2. APOCRITA Apocrita is a distributed peer-to-peer file sharing system, and has been designed to make finding documents easier in an Intranet environment. Currently, it is possible for documents to be located on a users machine or on a remote machine. It is even possible that different revisions could reside on each node on the Intranet. This means there must be a manual process to maintain document versions. Apocrita solves this problem using two approaches. First, due to the inherent nature of Apocrita, the document will only reside on a single logical location. Second, Apocrita provides a method of reverting to previous document versions.

For example, if a machine contains an important document and the machine is currently inaccessible, the system is capable of maintaining availability of the document through this distribution mechanism. It provides a simple interface for searching and accessing files that may exist either locally or remotely. The distributed nature of the documents is transparent to the user. Apocrita supports a decentralized network model where the peers use a discovery protocol to determine peers. Apocrita is intended for network users on an Intranet. The main focus is organizations that may not have a network large enough to require a file server and supporting infrastructure. It eliminates the need for documents to be manually shared between users while being edited and reduces the possibility of conflicting versions being distributed. The system also provides some redundancy and in the event of a single machine failure, no important documents will be lost. It is operating system independent, and easy to access through a web browser or through a standalone application. To decrease the time required for indexing a large number of documents, the indexing process is distributed across available idle nodes. Local and remote files should be easily accessible through a virtual mountable file system, providing transparency for users. 3. DISTRIBUTED INDEXING Apocrita uses a distributed index for all the documents that are available on the Intranet. Each node will contain part of the full index, and be aware of what part of the index each other node has. A node will be able to contact each node that contains a unique portion of the index. In addition, each node has a separate local index of its own documents. But as discussed later, in the current implementation, each node has a copy of the entire index. Indexing of the documents is distributed. Therefore, if a node is in the process of indexing many documents, it will break up the work over the nodes. Once a nodes local index is updated with the new documents, the distributed index will then be updated. The current distributed indexing system consists of three separate modules: NodeController, FileSender, and NodeIndexer. The responsibility of each module is discussed later in this section. 3.1 Indexing Protocol The protocol we have designed for the distributed indexing is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Apocrita distributed indexing protocol. IDLE QUERY: The IDLE QUERY is sent out from the initiating node to determine which other nodes may be able to help with the overall indexing process. There are no parameters sent with the command. The receiving node will respond with either a BUSY or IDLE command. If the IDLE command is received, the initiating node will add the responding node to a list of available distributed indexing helpers. In the case of a BUSY command being received, the responding node is ignored. BUSY: Once a node received an IDL QUERY, it will determine whether it can be considered a candidate for distributed indexing. This determination is based on the overall CPU usage of the node. If the node is using most of its CPU for other processes, the node will respond to the IDLE QUERY with a BUSY command. IDLE: As with the case of the BUSY response, the node receiving the IDLE QUERY will determine its eligibility for distributed indexing. To be considered a candidate for distributed indexing, the overall CPU usage must be at a minimum to all for dedicated indexing of the distributed documents. If this is the case, the node will respond with an IDLE command. INCOMING FILE: Once the initiating node assembles a set of idle nodes to assist with the distributed indexing, it will divide the documents to be sent to the nodes. To do this, it sends an INCOMING FILE message, which contains the name of the file as well as the size in bytes. After the INCOMING FILE command has been sent, the initiating node will begin to stream the file to the other node. The initiating node will loop through the files that are to be sent to the other node; each file stream being preceded by the INCOMING FILE command with the appropriate parameters. INDEX FILE: Once the indexing node has completed the indexing process of the set of files, it must send the resultant index back to the initiating node. The index is comprised of multiple files, which exist on the file system of the indexing node. As with the INCOMING FILE command, the indexing node streams each index file after sending an INDEX FILE command. The INDEX FILE command has two parameters: the first being the name of the index, and the second is the size of the file in bytes. SEND COMPLETE: When sending the sets of files for both the index and the files to be indexed, the node must notify the corresponding node when the process is complete. Once the initiating node is finished sending the set of documents to be indexed, it will then send a SEND COMPLETE command indicating to the indexing node that there are no more files and the node can proceed with indexing the files. In the case of the initiating node sending the index files, the indexing node will complete the transfer with the SEND COMPLETE command indicating to the initiating node that there are no more index files to be sent and the initiating node can then assemble those index files into the main index. The NodeController is responsible for setting up connections with nodes in the idle state to distribute the indexing process. Using JXTA [5], the node controller will obtain a set of nodes. This set of nodes is iterated and each one is sent the IDLE QUERY command. The nodes that respond with idle are then collected. The set of idle nodes includes the node initiating the distributed indexing process, referred to as the local node. Once the collection of idle nodes is obtained, the node updates the set of controllers and evenly divides the set of documents that are to be indexed. For example, if there are 100 documents and 10 nodes (including the local node) then each node will have 10 documents to index. For each indexing node an instance of the FileSender object is created. The FileSender is aware of the set of documents that node is responsible for. Once a FileSender object has been created for each node, the NodeController waits for each FileSender to complete. When the FileSender objects have completed the NodeController will take the resultant indexes from 175 each node and pass them to an instance of the IndexCompiler, which maintains the index and the list of FileSenders. Once the IndexCompiler has completed it will return to the idle state and activate the directory scanner to monitor the locally owned set of documents for changes that may require reindexing. The NodeIndexer is responsible for receiving documents sent to it by the initiating node and then indexing them using the Lucene engine [7]. Once the indexing is complete the resulting index is streamed back to the initiating node as well as compiled in the indexer nodes own local index. Before initiating the indexing process it must be sent an IDLE QUERY message. This is the first command that sets off the indexing process. The indexer node will determine whether it is considered idle based on the current CPU usage. As outlined in the protocol section if the node is not being used and has a low overall CPU usage percentage it will return IDLE to the IDLE QUERY command. If the indexer nodes CPU usage is above 50% for a specified amount of time it is then considered to be busy and will respond to the IDLE QUERY command with BUSY. If a node is determined busy it returns to its listening state waiting for another IDLE QUERY from another initiating node. If the node is determined to be idle it will enter the state where it will receive files from the initiating node that it is responsible for indexing. Once all of the files are received by the initiating node, indicated by a SEND COMPLETE message, it starts an instance of the Lucene indexing engine. The files are stored in a temporary directory separate from the nodes local documents that it is responsible for maintaining an index of. The Lucene index writer then indexes all of the transferred files. The index is stored on the drive within a temporary directory separate from the current index. After the indexing of the files completes the indexer node enters the state where the index files are sent back to the initiating node. The indexer node loops through all of the files created by Lucenes IndexWriter and streams them to the initiating node. Once these files are sent back that index is then merged into the indexer nodes own full index of the existing files. It then enters the idle state where it will then listen for any other nodes that required distributing the indexing process. The FileSender object is the initiating node equivalent of the indexer node. It initiates the communication between the initiating node and the node that will assist in the distributed indexing. The initiating node runs many instances of the FileSender node one for each other node it has determined to be idle. Upon instantiation of the FileSender it is passed the node that it is responsible for contacting and the set of files that must be sent. The FileSenders first job is to send the files that are to be indexed by the other idle node. The files are streamed one at a time to the other node. It sends each file using the INCOMING FILE command. With that command it sends the name of the file being sent and the size in bytes. Once all files have been sent the FileSender sends the SEND COMPLETE command. The FileSender creates an instance of Lucenes IndexWriter and prepares to create the index in a temporary directory on the file system. The FileSender will begin to receive the files that are to be saved within the index. It receives an INDEX FILE command with the name of the files and the size in bytes. This file is then streamed into the temporary index directory on the FileSender node. After the transfer of the index files has been completed the FileSender notifies the instance of the index compiler that it is ready to combine the index. Each instance of the FileSender has its own unique section of temporary space to store the index that has been transferred back from the indexing node. When notifying the IndexCompiler it will also pass the location of the particular FileSenders directory location of that index. 4. PEER-TO-PEER DISTRIBUTION Apocrita uses a peer-to-peer distribution model in order to distribute files. Files are distributed solely from a serving node to a client node without regard for the availability of file pieces from other clients in the network. This means that the file transfers will be fast and efficient and should not severely affect the usability of serving nodes from the point of view of a local user. The JXTA framework [5] is used in order to implement peer-to-peer functionality. This has been decided due to the extremely shorttimeline of the project which allows us to take advantage of over five years of testing and development and support from many large organizations employing JXTA in their own products. We are not concerned with any potential quality problems because JXTA is considered to be the most mature and stable peer-to-peer framework available. Using JXTA terminology, there are three types of peers used in node classification. Edge peers are typically low-bandwidth, non-dedicated nodes. Due to these characteristics, edge peers are not used with Apocrita. Relay peers are typically higher-bandwidth, dedicated nodes. This is the classification of all nodes in the Apocrita network, and, as such, are the default classification used. Rendezvous peers are used to coordinate message passing between nodes in the Apocrita network. This means that a minimum of one rendezvous peer per subnet is required. 4.1 Peer Discovery The Apocrita server subsystem uses the JXTA Peer Discovery Protocol (PDP) in order to find participating peers within the network as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Apocrita peer discovery process. 176 The PDP listens for peer advertisements from other nodes in the Apocrita swarm. If a peer advertisement is detected, the server will attempt to join the peer group and start actively contributing to the network. If no peers are found by the discovery service, the server will create a new peer group and start advertising this peer group. This new peer group will be periodically advertised on the network; any new peers joining the network will attach to this peer group. A distinct advantage of using the JXTA PDP is that Apocrita does not have to be sensitive to particular networking nuances such as Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). In addition, Apocrita does not have to support one-to-many packet delivery methods such as multicast and instead can rely on JXTA for this support. 4.2 Index Query Operation All nodes in the Apocrita swarm have a complete and up-to-date copy of the network index stored locally. This makes querying the index for search results trivial. Unlike the Gnutella protocol, a query does not have to propagate throughout the network. This also means that the time to return query results is very fast - much faster than protocols that rely on nodes in the network to pass the query throughout the network and then wait for results. This is demonstrated in Figure 3. Figure 3. Apocrita query operation. Each document in the swarm has a unique document identification number (ID). A node will query the index and a result will be returned with both the document ID number as well as a list of peers with a copy of the matched document ID. It is then the responsibility of the searching peer to contact the peers in the list to negotiate file transfer between the client and server. 5. PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION Apocrita uses the Lucene framework [7], which is a project under development by the Apache Software Foundation. Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. In the current implementation, Apocrita is only capable of indexing plain text documents. Apocrita uses the JXTA framework [5] as a peer-to-peer transport library between nodes. JXTA is used to pass both messages and files between nodes in the search network. By using JXTA, Apocrita takes advantage of a reliable, and proven peer-to-peer transport mechanism. It uses the pipe facility in order to pass messages and files between nodes. The pipe facility provides many different types of pipe advertisements. This includes an unsecured unicast pipe, a secured unicast pipe, and a propagated unsecured pipe. Message passing is used to pass status messages between nodes in order to aid in indexing, searching, and retrieval. For example, a node attempting to find an idle node to participate in indexing will query nodes via the message facility. Idle nodes will reply with a status message to indicate they are available to start indexing. File passing is used within Apocrita for file transfer. After a file has been searched for and located within the peer group, a JXTA socket will be opened and file transfer will take place. A JXTA socket is similar to a standard Java socket, however a JXTA socket uses JXTA pipes in underlying network transport. File passing uses an unsecured unicast pipe in order to transfer data. File passing is also used within Apocrita for index transfer. Index transfer works exactly like a file transfer. In fact, the index transfer actually passes the index as a file. However, there is one key difference between file transfer and index transfer. In the case of file transfer, a socket is created between only two nodes. In the case of index transfer, a socket must be created between all nodes in the network in order to pass the index, which allows for all nodes to have a full and complete index of the entire network. In order to facilitate this transfer efficiently, index transfer will use an unsecured propagated pipe to communicate with all nodes in the Apocrita network. 6. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION It is difficult to objectively benchmark the results obtained through Apocrita because there is no other system currently available with the same goals as Apocrita. We have, however, evaluated the performance of the critical sections of the system. The critical sections were determined to be the processes that are the most time intensive. The evaluation was completed on standard lab computers on a 100Mb/s Ethernet LAN; the machines run Windows XP with a Pentium 4 CPU running at 2.4GHz with 512 MB of RAM. The indexing time has been run against both: the Time Magazine collection [8], which contains 432 documents and 83 queries and their most relevant results, and the NPL collection [8] that has a total of 11,429 documents and 93 queries with expected results. Each document ranges in size between 4KB and 8KB. As Figure 4 demonstrates, the number of nodes involved in the indexing process affects the time taken to complete the indexing processsometimes even drastically. Figure 4. Node vs. index time. The difference in going from one indexing node to two indexing nodes is the most drastic and equates to an indexing time 37% faster than a single indexing node. The different between two 177 indexing nodes and three indexing nodes is still significant and represents a 16% faster time than two indexing nodes. As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic. This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing. The time needed to communicate with a node is constant, so as the number of nodes increases, this constant becomes more prevalent. Also, the complexity of joining the indexing results is a complex operation and is complicated further as the number of indexing nodes increases. Socket performance is also a very important part of Apocrita. Benchmarks were performed using a 65MB file on a system with both the client and server running locally. This was done to isolate possible network issues. Although less drastic, similar results were shown when the client and server run on independent hardware. In order to mitigate possible unexpected errors, each test was run 10 times. Figure 5. Java sockets vs. JXTA sockets. As Figure 5 demonstrates, the performance of JXTA sockets is abysmal as compared to the performance of standard Java sockets. The minimum transfer rate obtained using Java sockets is 81,945KB/s while the minimum transfer rater obtained using JXTA sockets is much lower at 3, 805KB/s. The maximum transfer rater obtain using Java sockets is 97,412KB/s while the maximum transfer rate obtained using JXTA sockets is 5,530KB/s. Finally, the average transfer rate using Java sockets is 87,540KB/s while the average transfer rate using JXTA sockets is 4,293KB/s. The major problem found in these benchmarks is that the underlying network transport mechanism does not perform as quickly or efficiently as expected. In order to garner a performance increase, the JXTA framework needs to be substituted with a more traditional approach. The indexing time is also a bottleneck and will need to be improved for the overall quality of Apocrita to be improved. 7. RELATED WORK Several decentralized P2P systems [1, 2, 3] exist today that Apocrita features some of their functionality. However, Apocrita also has unique novel searching and indexing features that make this system unique. For example, Majestic-12 [4] is a distributed search and indexing project designed for searching the Internet. Each user would install a client, which is responsible for indexing a portion of the web. A central area for querying the index is available on the Majestic-12 web page. The index itself is not distributed, only the act of indexing is distributed. The distributed indexing aspect of this project most closely relates Apocrita goals. YaCy [6] is a peer-to-peer web search application. YaCy consists of a web crawler, an indexer, a built-in database engine, and a p2p index exchange protocol. YaCy is designed to maintain a distributed index of the Internet. It used a distributed hash table (DHT) to maintain the index. The local node is used to query but all results that are returned are accessible on the Internet. YaCy used many peers and DHT to maintain a distributed index. Apocrita will also use a distributed index in future implementations and may benefit from using an implementation of a DHT. YaCy however, is designed as a web search engine and, as such solves a much different problem than Apocrita. 8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We presented Apocrita, a distributed P2P searching and indexing system intended for network users on an Intranet. It can help organizations with no network file server or necessary network infrastructure to share documents. It eliminates the need for documents to be manually shared among users while being edited and reduce the possibility of conflicting versions being distributed. A proof of concept prototype has been constructed, but the results from measuring the network transport mechanism and the indexing time were not as impressive as initially envisioned. Despite these shortcomings, the experience gained from the design and implementation of Apocrita has given us more insight into building challenging distributed systems. For future work, Apocrita will have a smart content distribution model in which a single instance of a file can intelligently and transparently replicate throughout the network to ensure a copy of every important file will always be available regardless of the availability of specific nodes in the network. In addition, we plan to integrate a revision control system into the content distribution portion of Apocrita so that users could have the ability to update an existing file that they found and have the old revision maintained and the new revision propagated. Finally, the current implementation has some overhead and redundancy due to the fact that the entire index is maintained on each individual node, we plan to design a distributed index. 9.

Introducción El paradigma informático entre pares (P2P) se está convirtiendo en una forma completamente nueva de intercambio de recursos mutuos en Internet. Con el acceso a Internet de banda ancha cada vez más común, la tecnología P2P finalmente se ha convertido en una forma viable de compartir documentos y archivos de medios. Ya hay programas en el mercado que habilitan el intercambio de archivos P2P. Estos programas permiten a millones de usuarios compartir archivos entre ellos. Si bien la utilización de los clientes P2P ya es un paso gigantesco en comparación con la descarga de archivos de los sitios web, el uso de tales programas no está exento de problemas. Los archivos descargados aún requieren mucha administración manual por parte del usuario. El usuario aún necesita colocar los archivos en el directorio adecuado, administrar archivos con múltiples versiones, eliminar los archivos cuando ya no se desee. Nos esforzamos por facilitar el proceso de compartir documentos dentro de una intranet. Se requiere que muchas organizaciones sean documentos de los autores para diversos fines, y dichos documentos pueden necesitar ser accesibles por todos los miembros de la organización. Este acceso puede ser necesario para editar o simplemente ver un documento. En algunos casos, estos documentos se envían entre autores, por correo electrónico, para editar. Esto puede hacer que se envíen una versión incorrecta o se crean conflictos entre varios usuarios que intentan hacer enmiendas a un documento. Incluso puede haber múltiples documentos diferentes en el proceso de ser editado. Es posible que el usuario busque un documento en particular, que algunas herramientas de búsqueda, como Google Desktop, pueden ser una solución para documentos locales, pero no encontrarán un documento en otra máquina de usuarios. Además, algunas organizaciones no tienen un servidor de intercambio de archivos o la infraestructura de red necesaria para habilitar una. En este artículo presentamos a Apocrita, que es un sistema de intercambio de archivos P2P distribuido rentable para tales organizaciones. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos Apocrita. El mecanismo de indexación y protocolo distribuido se presentan en la Sección 3. La Sección 4 presenta el modelo de distribución entre pares. En la Sección 5 se presenta un prototipo de prueba de concepto, y las evaluaciones de rendimiento se analizan en la Sección 6. El trabajo relacionado se presenta es la Sección 7, y finalmente las conclusiones y el trabajo futuro se discuten en la Sección 8. 2. Apocrita apocrita es un sistema distribuido de intercambio de archivos entre pares, y ha sido diseñado para facilitar la búsqueda de documentos en un entorno de intranet. Actualmente, es posible que los documentos se encuentren en una máquina de usuarios o en una máquina remota. Incluso es posible que diferentes revisiones puedan residir en cada nodo en la intranet. Esto significa que debe haber un proceso manual para mantener versiones de documentos. Apocrita resuelve este problema utilizando dos enfoques. Primero, debido a la naturaleza inherente de Apocrita, el documento solo residirá en una sola ubicación lógica. En segundo lugar, Apocrita proporciona un método de revertir a versiones de documentos anteriores. El permiso de Apocrita para hacer copias digitales o difíciles de todo o parte de este trabajo para uso personal o en el aula se otorga sin tarifa siempre que las copias no sean o se distribuyan para obtener ganancias o ventajas comerciales y que las copias tengan este aviso y la cita completa del primeropágina. Copiar lo contrario, o volver a publicar, publicar en servidores o redistribuir a las listas, requiere un permiso específico previo y/o una tarifa. ACMSE07, 23-24 de marzo de 2007, Winston-Salem, NC, EE. UU. Copyright 2007 ACM 978-1-59593-629-5/07/0003 ... $ 5.00.174 también distribuirá documentos en múltiples máquinas para garantizar una alta disponibilidad de documentos importantes. Por ejemplo, si una máquina contiene un documento importante y la máquina es actualmente inaccesible, el sistema es capaz de mantener la disponibilidad del documento a través de este mecanismo de distribución. Proporciona una interfaz simple para buscar y acceder a archivos que pueden existir locales o de forma remota. La naturaleza distribuida de los documentos es transparente para el usuario. Apocrita admite un modelo de red descentralizado donde los pares usan un protocolo de descubrimiento para determinar los compañeros. Apocrita está destinado a usuarios de red en una intranet. El enfoque principal son las organizaciones que pueden no tener una red lo suficientemente grande como para requerir un servidor de archivos e infraestructura de soporte. Elimina la necesidad de que los documentos se compartan manualmente entre los usuarios mientras se editan y reduce la posibilidad de distribuir versiones conflictivas. El sistema también proporciona cierta redundancia y, en caso de falla de una sola máquina, no se perderán documentos importantes. Es independiente del sistema operativo y fácil de acceder a través de un navegador web o a través de una aplicación independiente. Para disminuir el tiempo requerido para indexar una gran cantidad de documentos, el proceso de indexación se distribuye en los nodos inactivos disponibles. Los archivos locales y remotos deben ser fácilmente accesibles a través de un sistema de archivos de montaje virtual, proporcionando transparencia para los usuarios.3. Indexación distribuida Apocrita utiliza un índice distribuido para todos los documentos que están disponibles en la intranet. Cada nodo contendrá parte del índice completo y tendrá en cuenta qué parte del índice tiene el nodo del otro. Un nodo podrá contactar a cada nodo que contenga una parte única del índice. Además, cada nodo tiene un índice local separado de sus propios documentos. Pero como se discutió más adelante, en la implementación actual, cada nodo tiene una copia de todo el índice. Se distribuye la indexación de los documentos. Por lo tanto, si un nodo está en el proceso de indexar muchos documentos, romperá el trabajo sobre los nodos. Una vez que se actualiza un índice local de nodos con los nuevos documentos, el índice distribuido se actualizará. El sistema de indexación distribuida actual consta de tres módulos separados: NodeController, FileSender y NodeIdexer. La responsabilidad de cada módulo se discute más adelante en esta sección.3.1 Protocolo de indexación El protocolo que hemos diseñado para la indexación distribuida se muestra en la Figura 1. Figura 1. Protocolo de indexación distribuida de Apocrita. Consulta inactiva: la consulta inactiva se envía desde el nodo iniciador para determinar qué otros nodos pueden ayudar con el proceso de indexación general. No se envían parámetros con el comando. El nodo receptor responderá con un comando ocupado o inactivo. Si se recibe el comando inactivo, el nodo de iniciación agregará el nodo de respuesta a una lista de ayudantes de indexación distribuidos disponibles. En el caso de que se reciba un comando ocupado, se ignora el nodo de respuesta. Ocupado: una vez que un nodo recibió una consulta IDL, determinará si puede considerarse un candidato para la indexación distribuida. Esta determinación se basa en el uso general de la CPU del nodo. Si el nodo está utilizando la mayoría de su CPU para otros procesos, el nodo responderá a la consulta inactiva con un comando ocupado. Idle: Al igual que con el caso de la respuesta ocupada, el nodo que recibe la consulta inactiva determinará su elegibilidad para la indexación distribuida. Para ser considerado un candidato para la indexación distribuida, el uso general de la CPU debe ser mínimo a todos para la indexación dedicada de los documentos distribuidos. Si este es el caso, el nodo responderá con un comando inactivo. Archivo entrante: una vez que el nodo iniciador ensambla un conjunto de nodos inactivos para ayudar con la indexación distribuida, dividirá los documentos que se enviarán a los nodos. Para hacer esto, envía un mensaje de archivo entrante, que contiene el nombre del archivo, así como el tamaño en los bytes. Después de que se haya enviado el comando de archivo entrante, el nodo de iniciación comenzará a transmitir el archivo al otro nodo. El nodo de iniciación pasará a través de los archivos que se enviarán al otro nodo;Cada transmisión de archivo está precedida por el comando de archivo entrante con los parámetros apropiados. Archivo de índice: una vez que el nodo de indexación ha completado el proceso de indexación del conjunto de archivos, debe devolver el índice resultante al nodo de iniciación. El índice se compone de múltiples archivos, que existen en el sistema de archivos del nodo de indexación. Al igual que con el comando de archivo entrante, el nodo de indexación transmite cada archivo de índice después de enviar un comando de archivo de índice. El comando de archivo de índice tiene dos parámetros: el primero es el nombre del índice, y el segundo es el tamaño del archivo en bytes. Enviar Complete: al enviar los conjuntos de archivos tanto para el índice como para los archivos que se indexarán, el nodo debe notificar al nodo correspondiente cuando el proceso esté completo. Una vez que el nodo de iniciación esté terminado de enviar el conjunto de documentos a indexar, luego enviará un comando Enviar un comando completo que indique al nodo de indexación que no hay más archivos y que el nodo puede continuar indexando los archivos. En el caso de que el nodo iniciado que envíe los archivos de índice, el nodo de indexación completará la transferencia con el comando Enviar el comando completo que indica al nodo de iniciación que no hay más archivos de índice que se enviarán y el nodo de iniciación puede ensamblar esos archivos de índice enEl índice principal. El nodecontroller es responsable de configurar conexiones con nodos en el estado inactivo para distribuir el proceso de indexación. Usando JXTA [5], el controlador de nodo obtendrá un conjunto de nodos. Este conjunto de nodos se itera y cada uno se envía al comando de consulta inactiva. Luego se recogen los nodos que responden con inactivo. El conjunto de nodos inactivos incluye el nodo que inicia el proceso de indexación distribuido, denominado nodo local. Una vez que se obtiene la colección de nodos inactivos, el nodo actualiza el conjunto de controladores y divide uniformemente el conjunto de documentos que se indexarán. Por ejemplo, si hay 100 documentos y 10 nodos (incluido el nodo local), cada nodo tendrá 10 documentos para indexar. Para cada nodo de indexación se crea una instancia del objeto FileSender. El FileSender es consciente del conjunto de documentos de los que el nodo es responsable. Una vez que se ha creado un objeto FileSender para cada nodo, el NodeController espera a que se complete cada FileSender. Cuando los objetos de FileSender hayan completado, el nodecontroller tomará los índices resultantes de 175 cada nodo y los pasará a una instancia del IndexCompiler, que mantiene el índice y la lista de los estudiantes de archivos. Una vez que el IndexCompiler haya completado, volverá al estado inactivo y activará el escáner de directorio para monitorear el conjunto de documentos de propiedad local para los cambios que pueden requerir reintegración. El NodeIndexer es responsable de recibir documentos que se le envíen al nodo iniciador y luego indexarlos usando el motor Lucene [7]. Una vez que se completa la indexación, el índice resultante se transmite de regreso al nodo de iniciación, así como se compila en el índice local de los nodos indexadores. Antes de iniciar el proceso de indexación, debe enviarse un mensaje de consulta inactiva. Este es el primer comando que configura el proceso de indexación. El nodo indexador determinará si se considera inactivo según el uso actual de la CPU. Como se describe en la sección Protocolo si el nodo no se usa y tiene un bajo porcentaje general de uso de la CPU, devolverá inactivo al comando de consulta inactiva. Si el uso de la CPU de los nodos indexadores es superior al 50% durante una cantidad de tiempo especificada, se considera que está ocupado y responderá al comando de consulta inactiva con ocupado. Si se determina que un nodo está ocupado, regresa a su estado de escucha esperando otra consulta inactiva de otro nodo iniciador. Si se determina que el nodo está inactivo, ingresará al estado donde recibirá archivos del nodo de iniciación que es responsable de la indexación. Una vez que todos los archivos son recibidos por el nodo iniciador, indicado por un mensaje de envío completo, inicia una instancia del motor de indexación de Lucene. Los archivos se almacenan en un directorio temporal separado de los nodos documentos locales que es responsable de mantener un índice de. El escritor de Lucene Index luego indexa todos los archivos transferidos. El índice se almacena en la unidad dentro de un directorio temporal separado del índice actual. Después de completar la indexación de los archivos, el nodo indexador ingresa al estado donde los archivos de índice se envían de regreso al nodo de iniciación. El nodo indexador buce a través de todos los archivos creados por Lucenes Indexwriter y los transmite al nodo iniciador. Una vez que se envían estos archivos, ese índice se fusiona en el índice completo de los nodos indexadores de los archivos existentes. Luego ingresa al estado inactivo donde luego escuchará cualquier otro nodo que requiriera distribuir el proceso de indexación. El objeto FileSender es el equivalente de nodo iniciador del nodo indexador. Inicia la comunicación entre el nodo iniciador y el nodo que ayudará en la indexación distribuida. El nodo iniciador ejecuta muchas instancias del nodo de FileSender uno para el otro que ha determinado que está inactivo. Al instanciar el FileSender se pasa el nodo que es responsable de contactar y el conjunto de archivos que deben enviarse. El primer trabajo de FileSenders es enviar los archivos que deben ser indexados por el otro nodo inactivo. Los archivos se transmiten uno a la vez al otro nodo. Envía cada archivo usando el comando de archivo entrante. Con ese comando envía el nombre del archivo que se envía y el tamaño en los bytes. Una vez que se hayan enviado todos los archivos, el FileSender envía el comando Enviar Complete. El FileSender crea una instancia de Lucenes IndexWriter y se prepara para crear el índice en un directorio temporal en el sistema de archivos. El FileSender comenzará a recibir los archivos que se guardarán dentro del índice. Recibe un comando de archivo de índice con el nombre de los archivos y el tamaño en los bytes. Este archivo se transmite en el directorio de índice temporal en el nodo FileSender. Después de que se haya completado la transferencia de los archivos de índice, el FileSender notifica la instancia del compilador de índice de que está listo para combinar el índice. Cada instancia del FileSender tiene su propia sección única de espacio temporal para almacenar el índice que se ha transferido desde el nodo de indexación. Al notificar al IndexCompiler, también pasará la ubicación de la ubicación del directorio de los servicios de archivos particular de ese índice.4. Distribución de pares Apocrita utiliza un modelo de distribución de igual a igual para distribuir archivos. Los archivos se distribuyen únicamente de un nodo de servicio a un nodo cliente sin tener en cuenta la disponibilidad de piezas de archivos de otros clientes en la red. Esto significa que las transferencias de archivo serán rápidas y eficientes y no deberían afectar severamente la usabilidad de servir nodos desde el punto de vista de un usuario local. El marco JXTA [5] se usa para implementar la funcionalidad entre pares. Esto se ha decidido debido a la línea de infracción extremadamente corta del proyecto que nos permite aprovechar más de cinco años de pruebas y desarrollo y apoyo de muchas organizaciones grandes que emplean a JXTA en sus propios productos. No nos preocupa ningún problema potencial de calidad porque se considera que JXTA es el marco de igual a igual más maduro y estable disponible. Usando la terminología JXTA, hay tres tipos de pares utilizados en la clasificación de nodos. Los pares de borde son típicamente nodos de bajo ancho de banda y no dedicados. Debido a estas características, los compañeros de borde no se usan con Apocrita. Los pares de retransmisión suelen ser nodos dedicados de mayor ancho de banda. Esta es la clasificación de todos los nodos en la red Apocrita y, como tal, son la clasificación predeterminada utilizada. Los pares de encuentro se utilizan para coordinar el paso de mensajes entre nodos en la red Apocrita. Esto significa que se requiere un mínimo de un par de la cita por subred.4.1 Descubrimiento de pares El subsistema del servidor Apocrita utiliza el Protocolo de descubrimiento de pares JXTA (PDP) para encontrar pares participantes dentro de la red como se muestra en la Figura 2. Figura 2. Proceso de descubrimiento por pares de Apocrita.176 El PDP escucha anuncios de pares de otros nodos en el Swarm de Apocrita. Si se detecta un anuncio de pares, el servidor intentará unirse al grupo de pares y comenzar a contribuir activamente a la red. Si el servicio Discovery no encuentra pares, el servidor creará un nuevo grupo de pares y comenzará a anunciar este grupo de pares. Este nuevo grupo de pares se anunciará periódicamente en la red;Cualquier nuevo compañero que se una a la red se adjuntará a este grupo de pares. Una clara ventaja de usar el JXTA PDP es que Apocrita no tiene que ser sensible a matices de redes particulares, como la unidad de transmisión máxima (MTU). Además, Apocrita no tiene que admitir métodos de entrega de paquetes de uno a muchos como multidifusión y, en cambio, puede confiar en JXTA para este soporte.4.2 Operación de consulta de índice Todos los nodos en el enjambre de Apocrita tienen una copia completa y actualizada del índice de red almacenado localmente. Esto hace que la consulta del índice de resultados de búsqueda sea trivial. A diferencia del protocolo Gnutella, una consulta no tiene que propagarse en toda la red. Esto también significa que el tiempo para devolver los resultados de la consulta es muy rápido, mucho más rápido que los protocolos que dependen de los nodos en la red para pasar la consulta por toda la red y luego esperar resultados. Esto se demuestra en la Figura 3. Figura 3. Operación de consulta de Apocrita. Cada documento en el enjambre tiene un número de identificación de documento único (ID). Un nodo consultará el índice y un resultado se devolverá con el número de identificación del documento, así como una lista de pares con una copia de la ID de documento coincidente. Entonces es responsabilidad del par de búsqueda contactar a los pares en la lista para negociar la transferencia de archivos entre el cliente y el servidor.5. Implementación de prototipo Apocrita utiliza el marco Lucene [7], que es un proyecto en desarrollo de Apache Software Foundation. Apache Lucene es una biblioteca de motor de búsqueda de texto de alto rendimiento y con todas las funciones escrita completamente en Java. En la implementación actual, Apocrita solo es capaz de indexar documentos de texto plano. Apocrita usa el marco JXTA [5] como una biblioteca de transporte de igual a igual entre nodos. JXTA se usa para pasar mensajes y archivos entre nodos en la red de búsqueda. Al usar JXTA, Apocrita aprovecha un mecanismo de transporte de pares confiable y probado. Utiliza la instalación de tuberías para pasar mensajes y archivos entre nodos. La instalación de tuberías proporciona muchos tipos diferentes de anuncios de tuberías. Esto incluye una tubería de unidifusión no garantizada, una tubería de unidifusión segura y una tubería no garantizada propagada. El paso de mensajes se usa para pasar mensajes de estado entre nodos para ayudar a indexación, búsqueda y recuperación. Por ejemplo, un nodo que intenta encontrar un nodo inactivo para participar en la indexación consultará nodos a través de la instalación de mensajes. Los nodos inactivos responderán con un mensaje de estado para indicar que están disponibles para comenzar a indexación. El paso de archivos se usa dentro de Apocrita para la transferencia de archivos. Después de que se haya buscado y ubicado un archivo dentro del grupo de pares, se abrirá un socket JXTA y se realizará la transferencia de archivos. Un socket JXTA es similar a un enchufe Java estándar, sin embargo, un socket JXTA utiliza tuberías JXTA en el transporte de red subyacente. El paso de archivos utiliza una tubería de unidifusión no garantizada para transferir datos. El paso de archivos también se usa dentro de Apocrita para la transferencia de índice. La transferencia de índice funciona exactamente como una transferencia de archivo. De hecho, la transferencia de índice en realidad pasa el índice como un archivo. Sin embargo, hay una diferencia clave entre la transferencia de archivos y la transferencia de índice. En el caso de la transferencia de archivos, se crea un socket entre solo dos nodos. En el caso de la transferencia de índice, se debe crear un socket entre todos los nodos en la red para pasar el índice, lo que permite que todos los nodos tengan un índice completo y completo de toda la red. Para facilitar esta transferencia de manera eficiente, la transferencia de índice utilizará una tubería propagada no garantizada para comunicarse con todos los nodos en la red Apocrita.6. Evaluación del rendimiento Es difícil comparar objetivamente los resultados obtenidos a través de Apocrita porque actualmente no hay otro sistema disponible con los mismos objetivos que Apocrita. Sin embargo, hemos evaluado el rendimiento de las secciones críticas del sistema. Se determinó que las secciones críticas son los procesos que son los más intensivos en el tiempo. La evaluación se completó en computadoras de laboratorio estándar en una LAN Ethernet de 100 MB/S;Las máquinas ejecutan Windows XP con una CPU Pentium 4 que se ejecuta a 2.4GHz con 512 MB de RAM. El tiempo de indexación se ha ejecutado contra ambos: The Time Magazine Collection [8], que contiene 432 documentos y 83 consultas y sus resultados más relevantes, y la colección NPL [8] que tiene un total de 11,429 documentos y 93 consultas con resultados esperados. Cada documento varía en tamaño entre 4KB y 8KB. Como lo demuestra la Figura 4, el número de nodos involucrados en el proceso de indexación afecta el tiempo necesario para completar los procesos de indexación a veces incluso drásticamente. Figura 4. Nodo vs. Tiempo de índice. La diferencia en pasar de un nodo de indexación a dos nodos de indexación es la más drástica y equivale a un tiempo de indexación 37% más rápido que un solo nodo de indexación. La diferente entre dos 177 nodos de indexación y tres nodos de indexación sigue siendo significativo y representa un tiempo de 16% más rápido que dos nodos de indexación. A medida que aumenta el número de nodos de indexación, los resultados son menos dramáticos. Esto se puede atribuir a la sobrecarga de tiempo asociada con la indexación de muchos nodos. El tiempo necesario para comunicarse con un nodo es constante, por lo que a medida que aumenta el número de nodos, esta constante se vuelve más frecuente. Además, la complejidad de unir los resultados de la indexación es una operación compleja y se complica aún más a medida que aumenta el número de nodos de indexación. El rendimiento del socket también es una parte muy importante de Apocrita. Los puntos de referencia se realizaron utilizando un archivo de 65 MB en un sistema con el cliente y el servidor que se ejecuta localmente. Esto se hizo para aislar posibles problemas de red. Aunque menos drásticos, se mostraron resultados similares cuando el cliente y el servidor se ejecutan en hardware independiente. Para mitigar posibles errores inesperados, cada prueba se ejecutó 10 veces. Figura 5. Sockets Java vs. Sockets JXTA. Como demuestra la Figura 5, el rendimiento de los enchufes JXTA es abismal en comparación con el rendimiento de los enchufes Java estándar. La tasa de transferencia mínima obtenida usando enchufes Java es 81,945 kb/s, mientras que el evaluador de transferencia mínimo obtenido usando enchufes JXTA es mucho más bajo a 3, 805kb/s. El evaluador de transferencia máximo que se obtiene con enchufes Java es 97,412kb/s, mientras que la tasa de transferencia máxima obtenida usando enchufes JXTA es de 5,530 kb/s. Finalmente, la tasa de transferencia promedio que usa enchufes Java es de 87,540 kb/s, mientras que la tasa de transferencia promedio que usa enchufes JXTA es de 4,293 kb/s. El principal problema encontrado en estos puntos de referencia es que el mecanismo de transporte de red subyacente no funciona de manera tan rápida o eficiente como se esperaba. Para obtener un aumento de rendimiento, el marco JXTA necesita ser sustituido con un enfoque más tradicional. El tiempo de indexación también es un cuello de botella y deberá mejorarse para que se mejore la calidad general de Apocrita.7. Trabajo relacionado Varios sistemas P2P descentralizados [1, 2, 3] existen hoy que Apocrita presenta parte de su funcionalidad. Sin embargo, Apocrita también tiene características únicas de búsqueda e indexación de novelas que hacen que este sistema sea único. Por ejemplo, Majestic-12 [4] es un proyecto de búsqueda e indexación distribuido diseñado para buscar en Internet. Cada usuario instalaría un cliente, que es responsable de indexar una parte de la web. Un área central para consultar el índice está disponible en la página web Majestic-12. El índice en sí no se distribuye, solo se distribuye el acto de indexación. El aspecto de indexación distribuido de este proyecto más relata de cerca los objetivos de Apocrita. Yacy [6] es una aplicación de búsqueda web de igual a igual. Yacy consiste en un rastreador web, un indexador, un motor de base de datos incorporado y un protocolo de intercambio de índice P2P. Yacy está diseñado para mantener un índice distribuido de Internet. Utilizó una tabla hash distribuida (DHT) para mantener el índice. El nodo local se usa para consultar, pero todos los resultados que se devuelven son accesibles en Internet. Yacy usó muchos compañeros y DHT para mantener un índice distribuido. Apocrita también utilizará un índice distribuido en futuras implementaciones y puede beneficiarse al usar una implementación de un DHT. Sin embargo, Yacy está diseñado como un motor de búsqueda web y, como tal, resuelve un problema muy diferente al de Apocrita.8. Conclusiones y trabajos futuros presentamos Apocrita, un sistema distribuido de búsqueda e indexación P2P destinado a usuarios de redes en una intranet. Puede ayudar a las organizaciones sin servidor de archivos de red o infraestructura de red necesaria para compartir documentos. Elimina la necesidad de que los documentos se compartan manualmente entre los usuarios mientras se editan y reducen la posibilidad de distribuir versiones conflictivas. Se ha construido un prototipo de prueba de concepto, pero los resultados de medir el mecanismo de transporte de red y el tiempo de indexación no fueron tan impresionantes como se imaginó inicialmente. A pesar de estas deficiencias, la experiencia obtenida del diseño e implementación de Apocrita nos ha dado más información sobre la construcción de sistemas distribuidos desafiantes. Para el trabajo futuro, Apocrita tendrá un modelo de distribución de contenido inteligente en el que una sola instancia de un archivo puede replicarse de manera inteligente y transparente en toda la red para garantizar que una copia de cada archivo importante siempre esté disponible, independientemente de la disponibilidad de nodos específicos en la red.. Además, planeamos integrar un sistema de control de revisión en la parte de distribución de contenido de Apocrita para que los usuarios puedan tener la capacidad de actualizar un archivo existente que encontraron y que mantengan la antigua revisión y se propague la nueva revisión. Finalmente, la implementación actual tiene algunos gastos generales y redundancia debido al hecho de que todo el índice se mantiene en cada nodo individual, planeamos diseñar un índice distribuido.9.

        "Once a FileSender object has been created for each node, the NodeController waits for each FileSender to complete.",
        "When the FileSender objects have completed the NodeController will take the resultant indexes from 175 each node and pass them to an instance of the IndexCompiler, which maintains the index and the list of FileSenders.",
        "Once the IndexCompiler has completed it will return to the idle state and activate the directory scanner to monitor the locally owned set of documents for changes that may require reindexing.",
        "The NodeIndexer is responsible for receiving documents sent to it by the initiating node and then indexing them using the Lucene engine [7].",
        "Once the indexing is complete the resulting index is streamed back to the initiating node as well as compiled in the indexer nodes own local index.",
        "Before initiating the indexing process it must be sent an IDLE QUERY message.",
        "This is the first command that sets off the indexing process.",
        "The indexer node will determine whether it is considered idle based on the current CPU usage.",
        "As outlined in the protocol section if the node is not being used and has a low overall CPU usage percentage it will return IDLE to the IDLE QUERY command.",
        "If the indexer nodes CPU usage is above 50% for a specified amount of time it is then considered to be busy and will respond to the IDLE QUERY command with BUSY.",
        "If a node is determined busy it returns to its listening state waiting for another IDLE QUERY from another initiating node.",
        "If the node is determined to be idle it will enter the state where it will receive files from the initiating node that it is responsible for indexing.",
        "Once all of the files are received by the initiating node, indicated by a SEND COMPLETE message, it starts an instance of the Lucene indexing engine.",
        "The files are stored in a temporary directory separate from the nodes local documents that it is responsible for maintaining an index of.",
        "The Lucene index writer then indexes all of the transferred files.",
        "The index is stored on the drive within a temporary directory separate from the current index.",
        "After the indexing of the files completes the indexer node enters the state where the index files are sent back to the initiating node.",
        "The indexer node loops through all of the files created by Lucenes IndexWriter and streams them to the initiating node.",
        "Once these files are sent back that index is then merged into the indexer nodes own full index of the existing files.",
        "It then enters the idle state where it will then listen for any other nodes that required distributing the indexing process.",
        "The FileSender object is the initiating node equivalent of the indexer node.",
        "It initiates the communication between the initiating node and the node that will assist in the distributed indexing.",
        "The initiating node runs many instances of the FileSender node one for each other node it has determined to be idle.",
        "Upon instantiation of the FileSender it is passed the node that it is responsible for contacting and the set of files that must be sent.",
        "The FileSenders first job is to send the files that are to be indexed by the other idle node.",
        "The files are streamed one at a time to the other node.",
        "It sends each file using the INCOMING FILE command.",
        "With that command it sends the name of the file being sent and the size in bytes.",
        "Once all files have been sent the FileSender sends the SEND COMPLETE command.",
        "The FileSender creates an instance of Lucenes IndexWriter and prepares to create the index in a temporary directory on the file system.",
        "The FileSender will begin to receive the files that are to be saved within the index.",
        "It receives an INDEX FILE command with the name of the files and the size in bytes.",
        "This file is then streamed into the temporary index directory on the FileSender node.",
        "After the transfer of the index files has been completed the FileSender notifies the instance of the index compiler that it is ready to combine the index.",
        "Each instance of the FileSender has its own unique section of temporary space to store the index that has been transferred back from the indexing node.",
        "When notifying the IndexCompiler it will also pass the location of the particular FileSenders directory location of that index. 4.",
        "PEER-TO-PEER DISTRIBUTION Apocrita uses a peer-to-peer distribution model in order to distribute files.",
        "Files are distributed solely from a serving node to a client node without regard for the availability of file pieces from other clients in the network.",
        "This means that the file transfers will be fast and efficient and should not severely affect the usability of serving nodes from the point of view of a local user.",
        "The JXTA framework [5] is used in order to implement peer-to-peer functionality.",
        "This has been decided due to the extremely shorttimeline of the project which allows us to take advantage of over five years of testing and development and support from many large organizations employing JXTA in their own products.",
        "We are not concerned with any potential quality problems because JXTA is considered to be the most mature and stable peer-to-peer framework available.",
        "Using JXTA terminology, there are three types of peers used in node classification.",
        "Edge peers are typically low-bandwidth, non-dedicated nodes.",
        "Due to these characteristics, edge peers are not used with Apocrita.",
        "Relay peers are typically higher-bandwidth, dedicated nodes.",
        "This is the classification of all nodes in the Apocrita network, and, as such, are the default classification used.",
        "Rendezvous peers are used to coordinate message passing between nodes in the Apocrita network.",
        "This means that a minimum of one rendezvous peer per subnet is required. 4.1 Peer Discovery The Apocrita server subsystem uses the JXTA Peer Discovery Protocol (PDP) in order to find participating peers within the network as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Figure 2.",
        "Apocrita peer discovery process. 176 The PDP listens for peer advertisements from other nodes in the Apocrita swarm.",
        "If a peer advertisement is detected, the server will attempt to join the peer group and start actively contributing to the network.",
        "If no peers are found by the discovery service, the server will create a new peer group and start advertising this peer group.",
        "This new peer group will be periodically advertised on the network; any new peers joining the network will attach to this peer group.",
        "A distinct advantage of using the JXTA PDP is that Apocrita does not have to be sensitive to particular networking nuances such as Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).",
        "In addition, Apocrita does not have to support one-to-many packet delivery methods such as multicast and instead can rely on JXTA for this support. 4.2 Index Query Operation All nodes in the Apocrita swarm have a complete and up-to-date copy of the network index stored locally.",
        "This makes querying the index for search results trivial.",
        "Unlike the Gnutella protocol, a query does not have to propagate throughout the network.",
        "This also means that the time to return query results is very fast - much faster than protocols that rely on nodes in the network to pass the query throughout the network and then wait for results.",
        "This is demonstrated in Figure 3.",
        "Figure 3.",
        "Apocrita query operation.",
        "Each document in the swarm has a unique document identification number (ID).",
        "A node will query the index and a result will be returned with both the document ID number as well as a list of peers with a copy of the matched document ID.",
        "It is then the responsibility of the searching peer to contact the peers in the list to negotiate file transfer between the client and server. 5.",
        "PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION Apocrita uses the Lucene framework [7], which is a project under development by the Apache Software Foundation.",
        "Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java.",
        "In the current implementation, Apocrita is only capable of indexing plain text documents.",
        "Apocrita uses the JXTA framework [5] as a peer-to-peer transport library between nodes.",
        "JXTA is used to pass both messages and files between nodes in the search network.",
        "By using JXTA, Apocrita takes advantage of a reliable, and proven peer-to-peer transport mechanism.",
        "It uses the pipe facility in order to pass messages and files between nodes.",
        "The pipe facility provides many different types of pipe advertisements.",
        "This includes an unsecured unicast pipe, a secured unicast pipe, and a propagated unsecured pipe.",
        "Message passing is used to pass status messages between nodes in order to aid in indexing, searching, and retrieval.",
        "For example, a node attempting to find an idle node to participate in indexing will query nodes via the message facility.",
        "Idle nodes will reply with a status message to indicate they are available to start indexing.",
        "File passing is used within Apocrita for file transfer.",
        "After a file has been searched for and located within the peer group, a JXTA socket will be opened and file transfer will take place.",
        "A JXTA socket is similar to a standard Java socket, however a JXTA socket uses JXTA pipes in underlying network transport.",
        "File passing uses an unsecured unicast pipe in order to transfer data.",
        "File passing is also used within Apocrita for index transfer.",
        "Index transfer works exactly like a file transfer.",
        "In fact, the index transfer actually passes the index as a file.",
        "However, there is one key difference between file transfer and index transfer.",
        "In the case of file transfer, a socket is created between only two nodes.",
        "In the case of index transfer, a socket must be created between all nodes in the network in order to pass the index, which allows for all nodes to have a full and complete index of the entire network.",
        "In order to facilitate this transfer efficiently, index transfer will use an unsecured propagated pipe to communicate with all nodes in the Apocrita network. 6.",
        "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION It is difficult to objectively benchmark the results obtained through Apocrita because there is no other system currently available with the same goals as Apocrita.",
        "We have, however, evaluated the performance of the critical sections of the system.",
        "The critical sections were determined to be the processes that are the most time intensive.",
        "The evaluation was completed on standard lab computers on a 100Mb/s Ethernet LAN; the machines run Windows XP with a Pentium 4 CPU running at 2.4GHz with 512 MB of RAM.",
        "The indexing time has been run against both: the Time Magazine collection [8], which contains 432 documents and 83 queries and their most relevant results, and the NPL collection [8] that has a total of 11,429 documents and 93 queries with expected results.",
        "Each document ranges in size between 4KB and 8KB.",
        "As Figure 4 demonstrates, the number of nodes involved in the indexing process affects the time taken to complete the indexing processsometimes even drastically.",
        "Figure 4.",
        "Node vs. index time.",
        "The difference in going from one indexing node to two indexing nodes is the most drastic and equates to an indexing time 37% faster than a single indexing node.",
        "The different between two 177 indexing nodes and three indexing nodes is still significant and represents a 16% faster time than two indexing nodes.",
        "As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic.",
        "This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing.",
        "The time needed to communicate with a node is constant, so as the number of nodes increases, this constant becomes more prevalent.",
        "Also, the complexity of joining the indexing results is a complex operation and is complicated further as the number of indexing nodes increases.",
        "Socket performance is also a very important part of Apocrita.",
        "Benchmarks were performed using a 65MB file on a system with both the client and server running locally.",
        "This was done to isolate possible network issues.",
        "Although less drastic, similar results were shown when the client and server run on independent hardware.",
        "In order to mitigate possible unexpected errors, each test was run 10 times.",
        "Figure 5.",
        "Java sockets vs. JXTA sockets.",
        "As Figure 5 demonstrates, the performance of JXTA sockets is abysmal as compared to the performance of standard Java sockets.",
        "The minimum transfer rate obtained using Java sockets is 81,945KB/s while the minimum transfer rater obtained using JXTA sockets is much lower at 3, 805KB/s.",
        "The maximum transfer rater obtain using Java sockets is 97,412KB/s while the maximum transfer rate obtained using JXTA sockets is 5,530KB/s.",
        "Finally, the average transfer rate using Java sockets is 87,540KB/s while the average transfer rate using JXTA sockets is 4,293KB/s.",
        "The major problem found in these benchmarks is that the underlying network transport mechanism does not perform as quickly or efficiently as expected.",
        "In order to garner a performance increase, the JXTA framework needs to be substituted with a more traditional approach.",
        "The indexing time is also a bottleneck and will need to be improved for the overall quality of Apocrita to be improved. 7.",
        "RELATED WORK Several decentralized P2P systems [1, 2, 3] exist today that Apocrita features some of their functionality.",
        "However, Apocrita also has unique novel searching and indexing features that make this system unique.",
        "For example, Majestic-12 [4] is a distributed search and indexing project designed for searching the Internet.",
        "Each user would install a client, which is responsible for indexing a portion of the web.",
        "A central area for querying the index is available on the Majestic-12 web page.",
        "The index itself is not distributed, only the act of indexing is distributed.",
        "The distributed indexing aspect of this project most closely relates Apocrita goals.",
        "YaCy [6] is a peer-to-peer web search application.",
        "YaCy consists of a web crawler, an indexer, a built-in database engine, and a p2p index exchange protocol.",
        "YaCy is designed to maintain a distributed index of the Internet.",
        "It used a distributed hash table (DHT) to maintain the index.",
        "The local node is used to query but all results that are returned are accessible on the Internet.",
        "YaCy used many peers and DHT to maintain a distributed index.",
        "Apocrita will also use a distributed index in future implementations and may benefit from using an implementation of a DHT.",
        "YaCy however, is designed as a web search engine and, as such solves a much different problem than Apocrita. 8.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We presented Apocrita, a distributed P2P searching and indexing system intended for network users on an Intranet.",
        "It can help organizations with no network file server or necessary network infrastructure to share documents.",
        "It eliminates the need for documents to be manually shared among users while being edited and reduce the possibility of conflicting versions being distributed.",
        "A proof of concept prototype has been constructed, but the results from measuring the network transport mechanism and the indexing time were not as impressive as initially envisioned.",
        "Despite these shortcomings, the experience gained from the design and implementation of Apocrita has given us more insight into building challenging distributed systems.",
        "For future work, Apocrita will have a smart content distribution model in which a single instance of a file can intelligently and transparently replicate throughout the network to ensure a copy of every important file will always be available regardless of the availability of specific nodes in the network.",
        "In addition, we plan to integrate a revision control system into the content distribution portion of Apocrita so that users could have the ability to update an existing file that they found and have the old revision maintained and the new revision propagated.",
        "Finally, the current implementation has some overhead and redundancy due to the fact that the entire index is maintained on each individual node, we plan to design a distributed index. 9.",

                "Each instance of the FileSender has its own unique section of temporary space to store the index that has been transferred back from the indexing node.",
                "When notifying the IndexCompiler it will also pass the location of the particular FileSenders directory location of that index. 4.",
                "PEER-TO-PEER DISTRIBUTION Apocrita uses a peer-to-peer distribution model in order to distribute files.",
                "Files are distributed solely from a serving node to a client node without regard for the availability of file pieces from other clients in the network.",
                "This means that the file transfers will be fast and efficient and should not severely affect the usability of serving nodes from the point of view of a local user.",
                "The JXTA framework [5] is used in order to implement peer-to-peer functionality.",
                "This has been decided due to the extremely shorttimeline of the project which allows us to take advantage of over five years of testing and development and support from many large organizations employing JXTA in their own products.",
                "We are not concerned with any potential quality problems because JXTA is considered to be the most mature and stable peer-to-peer framework available.",
                "Using JXTA terminology, there are three types of peers used in node classification.",
                "Edge peers are typically low-bandwidth, non-dedicated nodes.",
                "Due to these characteristics, edge peers are not used with Apocrita.",
                "Relay peers are typically higher-bandwidth, dedicated nodes.",
                "This is the classification of all nodes in the Apocrita network, and, as such, are the default classification used.",
                "Rendezvous peers are used to coordinate message passing between nodes in the Apocrita network.",
                "This means that a minimum of one rendezvous peer per subnet is required. 4.1 Peer Discovery The Apocrita server subsystem uses the JXTA Peer Discovery Protocol (PDP) in order to find participating peers within the network as shown in Figure 2.",
                "Figure 2.",
                "Apocrita peer discovery process. 176 The PDP listens for peer advertisements from other nodes in the Apocrita swarm.",
                "If a peer advertisement is detected, the server will attempt to join the peer group and start actively contributing to the network.",
                "If no peers are found by the discovery service, the server will create a new peer group and start advertising this peer group.",
                "This new peer group will be periodically advertised on the network; any new peers joining the network will attach to this peer group.",
                "A distinct advantage of using the JXTA PDP is that Apocrita does not have to be sensitive to particular networking nuances such as Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).",
                "In addition, Apocrita does not have to support one-to-many packet delivery methods such as multicast and instead can rely on JXTA for this support. 4.2 Index Query Operation All nodes in the Apocrita swarm have a complete and up-to-date copy of the network index stored locally.",
                "This makes querying the index for search results trivial.",
                "Unlike the Gnutella protocol, a query does not have to propagate throughout the network.",
                "This also means that the time to return query results is very fast - much faster than protocols that rely on nodes in the network to pass the query throughout the network and then wait for results.",
                "This is demonstrated in Figure 3.",
                "Figure 3.",

                "The pipe facility provides many different types of pipe advertisements.",
                "This includes an unsecured unicast pipe, a secured unicast pipe, and a propagated unsecured pipe.",
                "Message passing is used to pass status messages between nodes in order to aid in indexing, searching, and retrieval.",
                "For example, a node attempting to find an idle node to participate in indexing will query nodes via the message facility.",
                "Idle nodes will reply with a status message to indicate they are available to start indexing.",
                "File passing is used within Apocrita for file transfer.",
                "After a file has been searched for and located within the peer group, a JXTA socket will be opened and file transfer will take place.",
                "A JXTA socket is similar to a standard Java socket, however a JXTA socket uses JXTA pipes in underlying network transport.",
                "File passing uses an unsecured unicast pipe in order to transfer data.",
                "File passing is also used within Apocrita for index transfer.",
                "Index transfer works exactly like a file transfer.",
                "In fact, the index transfer actually passes the index as a file.",
                "However, there is one key difference between file transfer and index transfer.",
                "In the case of file transfer, a socket is created between only two nodes.",
                "In the case of index transfer, a socket must be created between all nodes in the network in order to pass the index, which allows for all nodes to have a full and complete index of the entire network.",
                "In order to facilitate this transfer efficiently, index transfer will use an unsecured propagated pipe to communicate with all nodes in the Apocrita network. 6.",
                "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION It is difficult to objectively benchmark the results obtained through Apocrita because there is no other system currently available with the same goals as Apocrita.",
                "We have, however, evaluated the performance of the critical sections of the system.",
                "The critical sections were determined to be the processes that are the most time intensive.",
                "The evaluation was completed on standard lab computers on a 100Mb/s Ethernet LAN; the machines run Windows XP with a Pentium 4 CPU running at 2.4GHz with 512 MB of RAM.",
                "The indexing time has been run against both: the Time Magazine collection [8], which contains 432 documents and 83 queries and their most relevant results, and the NPL collection [8] that has a total of 11,429 documents and 93 queries with expected results.",
                "Each document ranges in size between 4KB and 8KB.",
                "As Figure 4 demonstrates, the number of nodes involved in the indexing process affects the time taken to complete the indexing processsometimes even drastically.",

                "Node vs. index time.",
                "The difference in going from one indexing node to two indexing nodes is the most drastic and equates to an indexing time 37% faster than a single indexing node.",
                "The different between two 177 indexing nodes and three indexing nodes is still significant and represents a 16% faster time than two indexing nodes.",
                "As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic.",
                "This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing.",
                "The time needed to communicate with a node is constant, so as the number of nodes increases, this constant becomes more prevalent.",
                "Also, the complexity of joining the indexing results is a complex operation and is complicated further as the number of indexing nodes increases.",
                "Socket performance is also a very important part of Apocrita.",
                "Benchmarks were performed using a 65MB file on a system with both the client and server running locally.",
                "This was done to isolate possible network issues.",
                "Although less drastic, similar results were shown when the client and server run on independent hardware.",

                "A proof of concept prototype has been constructed, but the results from measuring the network transport mechanism and the indexing time were not as impressive as initially envisioned.",
                "Despite these shortcomings, the experience gained from the design and implementation of Apocrita has given us more insight into building challenging distributed systems.",
                "For future work, Apocrita will have a smart content distribution model in which a single instance of a file can intelligently and transparently replicate throughout the network to ensure a copy of every important file will always be available regardless of the availability of specific nodes in the network.",
                "In addition, we plan to integrate a revision control system into the content distribution portion of Apocrita so that users could have the ability to update an existing file that they found and have the old revision maintained and the new revision propagated.",

                "As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic.",
                "This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing.",

                "Also, the complexity of joining the indexing results is a complex operation and is complicated further as the number of indexing nodes increases.",
                "Socket performance is also a very important part of Apocrita.",
                "Benchmarks were performed using a 65MB file on a system with both the client and server running locally.",

                "A JXTA socket is similar to a standard Java socket, however a JXTA socket uses JXTA pipes in underlying network transport.",
                "File passing uses an unsecured unicast pipe in order to transfer data.",

                "As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic.",
                "This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing.",
                "The time needed to communicate with a node is constant, so as the number of nodes increases, this constant becomes more prevalent.",
                "Also, the complexity of joining the indexing results is a complex operation and is complicated further as the number of indexing nodes increases.",
                "Socket performance is also a very important part of Apocrita.",
                "Benchmarks were performed using a 65MB file on a system with both the client and server running locally.",

                "This means that a minimum of one rendezvous peer per subnet is required. 4.1 Peer Discovery The Apocrita server subsystem uses the JXTA Peer Discovery Protocol (PDP) in order to find participating peers within the network as shown in Figure 2.",
                "Figure 2.",
                "Apocrita peer discovery process. 176 The PDP listens for peer advertisements from other nodes in the Apocrita swarm.",
                "If a peer advertisement is detected, the server will attempt to join the peer group and start actively contributing to the network.",
                "If no peers are found by the discovery service, the server will create a new peer group and start advertising this peer group.",
                "This new peer group will be periodically advertised on the network; any new peers joining the network will attach to this peer group.",
                "A distinct advantage of using the JXTA PDP is that Apocrita does not have to be sensitive to particular networking nuances such as Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).",
                "In addition, Apocrita does not have to support one-to-many packet delivery methods such as multicast and instead can rely on JXTA for this support. 4.2 Index Query Operation All nodes in the Apocrita swarm have a complete and up-to-date copy of the network index stored locally.",
                "This makes querying the index for search results trivial.",
                "Unlike the Gnutella protocol, a query does not have to propagate throughout the network.",
                "This also means that the time to return query results is very fast - much faster than protocols that rely on nodes in the network to pass the query throughout the network and then wait for results.",
                "This is demonstrated in Figure 3.",
                "Figure 3.",
                "Apocrita query operation.",
                "Each document in the swarm has a unique document identification number (ID).",
                "A node will query the index and a result will be returned with both the document ID number as well as a list of peers with a copy of the matched document ID.",
                "It is then the responsibility of the searching peer to contact the peers in the list to negotiate file transfer between the client and server. 5.",
                "PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION Apocrita uses the Lucene framework [7], which is a project under development by the Apache Software Foundation.",
                "Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java.",
                "In the current implementation, Apocrita is only capable of indexing plain text documents.",
                "Apocrita uses the JXTA framework [5] as a peer-to-peer transport library between nodes.",
                "JXTA is used to pass both messages and files between nodes in the search network.",
                "By using JXTA, Apocrita takes advantage of a reliable, and proven peer-to-peer transport mechanism.",
                "It uses the pipe facility in order to pass messages and files between nodes.",
                "The pipe facility provides many different types of pipe advertisements.",
                "This includes an unsecured unicast pipe, a secured unicast pipe, and a propagated unsecured pipe.",
                "Message passing is used to pass status messages between nodes in order to aid in indexing, searching, and retrieval.",
                "For example, a node attempting to find an idle node to participate in indexing will query nodes via the message facility.",
                "Idle nodes will reply with a status message to indicate they are available to start indexing.",
                "File passing is used within Apocrita for file transfer.",
                "After a file has been searched for and located within the peer group, a JXTA socket will be opened and file transfer will take place.",
                "A JXTA socket is similar to a standard Java socket, however a JXTA socket uses JXTA pipes in underlying network transport.",
                "File passing uses an unsecured unicast pipe in order to transfer data.",
                "File passing is also used within Apocrita for index transfer.",
                "Index transfer works exactly like a file transfer.",
                "In fact, the index transfer actually passes the index as a file.",
                "However, there is one key difference between file transfer and index transfer.",
                "In the case of file transfer, a socket is created between only two nodes.",
                "In the case of index transfer, a socket must be created between all nodes in the network in order to pass the index, which allows for all nodes to have a full and complete index of the entire network.",
                "In order to facilitate this transfer efficiently, index transfer will use an unsecured propagated pipe to communicate with all nodes in the Apocrita network. 6.",
                "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION It is difficult to objectively benchmark the results obtained through Apocrita because there is no other system currently available with the same goals as Apocrita.",
                "We have, however, evaluated the performance of the critical sections of the system.",
                "The critical sections were determined to be the processes that are the most time intensive.",
                "The evaluation was completed on standard lab computers on a 100Mb/s Ethernet LAN; the machines run Windows XP with a Pentium 4 CPU running at 2.4GHz with 512 MB of RAM.",
                "The indexing time has been run against both: the Time Magazine collection [8], which contains 432 documents and 83 queries and their most relevant results, and the NPL collection [8] that has a total of 11,429 documents and 93 queries with expected results.",
                "Each document ranges in size between 4KB and 8KB.",
                "As Figure 4 demonstrates, the number of nodes involved in the indexing process affects the time taken to complete the indexing processsometimes even drastically.",
                "Figure 4.",
                "Node vs. index time.",
                "The difference in going from one indexing node to two indexing nodes is the most drastic and equates to an indexing time 37% faster than a single indexing node.",
                "The different between two 177 indexing nodes and three indexing nodes is still significant and represents a 16% faster time than two indexing nodes.",
                "As the number of indexing nodes increases the results are less dramatic.",
                "This can be attributed to the time overhead associated with having many nodes perform indexing.",
                "The time needed to communicate with a node is constant, so as the number of nodes increases, this constant becomes more prevalent.",
                "Also, the complexity of joining the indexing results is a complex operation and is complicated further as the number of indexing nodes increases.",
                "Socket performance is also a very important part of Apocrita.",
                "Benchmarks were performed using a 65MB file on a system with both the client and server running locally.",
                "This was done to isolate possible network issues.",
                "Although less drastic, similar results were shown when the client and server run on independent hardware.",
                "In order to mitigate possible unexpected errors, each test was run 10 times.",
                "Figure 5.",
                "Java sockets vs. JXTA sockets.",
                "As Figure 5 demonstrates, the performance of JXTA sockets is abysmal as compared to the performance of standard Java sockets.",
                "The minimum transfer rate obtained using Java sockets is 81,945KB/s while the minimum transfer rater obtained using JXTA sockets is much lower at 3, 805KB/s.",

                "The major problem found in these benchmarks is that the underlying network transport mechanism does not perform as quickly or efficiently as expected.",
                "In order to garner a performance increase, the JXTA framework needs to be substituted with a more traditional approach.",
                "The indexing time is also a bottleneck and will need to be improved for the overall quality of Apocrita to be improved. 7.",

                "It eliminates the need for documents to be manually shared among users while being edited and reduce the possibility of conflicting versions being distributed.",
                "A proof of concept prototype has been constructed, but the results from measuring the network transport mechanism and the indexing time were not as impressive as initially envisioned.",
                "Despite these shortcomings, the experience gained from the design and implementation of Apocrita has given us more insight into building challenging distributed systems.",
                "For future work, Apocrita will have a smart content distribution model in which a single instance of a file can intelligently and transparently replicate throughout the network to ensure a copy of every important file will always be available regardless of the availability of specific nodes in the network.",
                "In addition, we plan to integrate a revision control system into the content distribution portion of Apocrita so that users could have the ability to update an existing file that they found and have the old revision maintained and the new revision propagated.",
                "Finally, the current implementation has some overhead and redundancy due to the fact that the entire index is maintained on each individual node, we plan to design a distributed index. 9.",
