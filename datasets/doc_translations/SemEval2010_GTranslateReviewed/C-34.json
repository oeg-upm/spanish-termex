A new kind of cluster deployed sensor networks distribution model is presented, and based on which, an innovative Hierarchical Hypercube model - H(k,u,m,v,n) and the mapping relationship between cluster deployed sensor networks and the H(k,u,m,v,n) are proposed. By utilizing nice properties of H(k,u,m,v,n) model, a new general framework for pairwise key predistribution and a new pairwise key establishment algorithm are designed, which combines the idea of KDC(Key Distribution Center) and polynomial pool schemes. Furthermore, the working performance of the newly proposed pairwise key establishment algorithm is seriously inspected. Theoretic analysis and experimental figures show that the new algorithm has better performance and provides higher possibilities for sensor to establish pairwise key, compared with previous related works.

INTRODUCTION Security communication is an important requirement in many sensor network applications, so shared secret keys are used between communicating nodes to encrypt data. As one of the most fundamental security services, pairwise key establishment enables the sensor nodes to communicate securely with each other using cryptographic techniques. However, due to the sensor nodes limited computational capabilities, battery energy, and available memory, it is not feasible for them to use traditional pairwise key establishment techniques such as public key cryptography and key distribution center (KDC). Several alternative approaches have been developed recently to perform pairwise key establishment on resource-constrained sensor networks without involving the use of traditional cryptography [14]. Eschenauer and Gligor proposed a basic probabilistic key predistribution scheme for pairwise key establishment [1]. In the scheme, each sensor node randomly picks a set of keys from a key pool before the deployment so that any two of the sensor nodes have a certain probability to share at least one common key. Chan et al. further extended this idea and presented two key predistribution schemes: a q-composite key pre-distribution scheme and a random pairwise keys scheme. The q-composite scheme requires any two sensors share at least q pre-distributed keys. The random scheme randomly picks pair of sensors and assigns each pair a unique random key [2]. Inspired by the studies above and the polynomial-based key pre-distribution protocol [3], Liu et al. further developed the idea addressed in the previous works and proposed a general framework of polynomial pool-based key predistribution [4]. The basic idea can be considered as the combination of the polynomial-based key pre-distribution and the key pool idea used in [1]] and [2]. Based on such a framework, they presented two pairwise key pre-distribution schemes: a random subset assignment scheme and a grid-based scheme. A polynomial pool is used in those schemes, instead of using a key pool in the previous techniques. The random subset assignment scheme assigns each sensor node the secrets generated from a random subset of polynomials in the polynomial pool. The gridbased scheme associates polynomials with the rows and the columns of an artificial grid, assigns each sensor node to a unique coordinate in the grid, and gives the node the secrets generated from the corresponding row and column polynomials. Based on this grid, each sensor node can then identify whether it can directly establish a pairwise key with another node, and if not, what intermediate nodes it can contact to indirectly establish the pairwise key. A similar approach to those schemes described by Liu et al was independently developed by Du et a. [5]. Rather than on Blundos scheme their approach is based on Bloms scheme [6]. In some cases, it is essentially equivalent to the one in [4]. All of those schemes above improve the security over the basic probabilistic key pre-distribution scheme. However, the pairwise key establishment problem in sensor networks is still not well solved. For the basic probabilistic and the q-composite key predistribution schemes, as the number of compromised nodes increases, the fraction of affected pairwise keys increases quickly. As a result, a small number of compromised nodes may affect a large fraction of pairwise keys [3]. Though the random pairwise keys scheme doses not suffer from the above security problem, it incurs a high memory overhead, which increases linearly with the number of nodes in the network if the level of security is kept constant [2][4]. For the random subset assignment scheme, it suffers higher communication and computation overheads. In 2004, Liu proposed a new hypercube-based pairwise key predistribution scheme [7], which extends the grid-based scheme from a two dimensional grid to a multi-dimensional hypercube. The analysis shows that hypercube-based scheme keeps some attractive properties of the grid-based scheme, including the guarantee of establishing pairwise keys and the resilience to node compromises. Also, when perfect security against node compromise is required, the hypercube-based scheme can support a larger network by adding more dimensions instead of increasing the storage overhead on sensor nodes. Though hypercube-based scheme (we consider the grid-based scheme is a special case of hypercube-based scheme) has many attractive properties, it requires any two nodes in sensor networks can communication directly with each other. This strong assumption is impractical in most of the actual applications of the sensor networks. In this paper, we present a kind of new cluster-based distribution model of sensor networks, and for which, we propose a new pairwise key pre-distribution scheme. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Combining the deployment knowledge of sensor networks and the polynomial pool-based key pre-distribution, we setup a clusterbased topology that is practical with the real deployment of sensor networks. Based on the topology, we propose a novel cluster distribution based hierarchical hypercube model to establish the pairwise key. The key contribution is that our scheme dose not require the assumption of all nodes can directly communicate with each other as the previous schemes do, and it still maintains high probability of key establishment, low memory overhead and good security performance. We develop a kind of new pairwise key establishment algorithm with our hierarchical hypercube model. The structure of this paper is arranged as follows: In section 3, a new distribution model of cluster deployed sensor networks is presented. In section 4, a new Hierarchical Hypercube model is proposed. In section 5, the mapping relationship between the clusters deployed sensor network and Hierarchical Hypercube model is discussed. In section 6 and section 7, new pairwise key establishment algorithm are designed based on the Hierarchical Hypercube model and detailed analyses are described. Finally, section 8 presents a conclusion. 2. PRELIMINARY Definition 1 (Key Predistribution): The procedure, which is used to encode the corresponding encryption and decryption algorithms in sensor nodes before distribution, is called Key Predistribution. Definition 2 (Pairwise Key): For any two nodes A and B, if they have a common key E, then the key E is called a pairwise key between them. Definition 3 (Key Path): For any two nodes A0 and Ak, when there has not a pairwise key between them, if there exists a path A0,A1,A2,……,Ak-1,Ak, and there exists at least one pairwise key between the nodes Ai and Aj for 0≤i≤k-1 and 1≤j≤k, then the path consisted of A0,A1,A2,……,Ak-1,Ak is called a Key Path between A0 and Ak. Definition 4 (n-dimensional Hypercube): An n-dimensional Hypercube (or n−cube) H(v,n) is a topology with the following properties: (1) It is consisted of n·vn-1 edges, (2) Each node can be coded as a string with n positions such as b1b2…bn, where 0≤b1,b2,…,bn≤v-1, (3) Any two nodes are called neighbors, which means that there is an edge between them, iff there is just one position different between their node codes. 3. MODEL OF CLUSTERS DEPLOYED SENSOR NETWORKS In some actual applications of sensor networks, sensors can be deployed through airplanes. Supposing that the deployment rounds of sensors are k, and the communication radius of any sensors is r, then the sensors deployed in the same round can be regarded as belonging to a same Cluster. We assign a unique cluster number l (1 ≤ l ≤ k) for each cluster. Supposing that the sensors form a connected graph in any cluster after deployment through airplanes, and then the Fig.1 presents an actual model of clusters deployed sensor networks. Figure.1 An actual model of clusters deployed sensor networks. From Figure.1, it is easy to know that, for a given node A, there exist lots of nodes in the same cluster of A, which can be communicated directly with A, since the nodes are deployed densely in a cluster. But there exist much less nodes in a cluster neighboring to the cluster of A, which can be communicated directly with A. since the two clusters are not deployed at the same time. 4. HIERARCHICAL HYPERCUBE MODEL Definition 5 (k-levels Hierarchical Hypercube): Let there are N nodes totally, then a k-levels Hierarchical Hypercube named H(k,u,m,v,n) can be constructed as follows: 1) The N nodes are divided into k clusters averagely, and the [N/k] nodes in any cluster are connected into an n-dimensional Hypercube: In the n-dimensional Hypercube, any node is encoded 55 as i1i2…in, which are called In-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes, where 0 ≤ i1,i2,…in ≤ v-1,v=[ n kN / ],[j] equals to an integer not less than j. So we can obtain k such kind of different hypercubes. 2) The k different hypercubes obtained above are encoded as j1j2…jm, which are called Out-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes, where 0 ≤ j1,j2,…jm ≤ u-1,u=[ m k ]. And the nodes in the k different hypercubes are connected into m-dimensional hypercubes according to the following rules: The nodes with same In-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes and different Out-ClusterHypercube-Node-Codes are connected into an m-dimensional hypercube. (The graph constructed through above steps is called a k-levels Hierarchical Hypercube abbreviated as H(k,u,m,v,n).) 3) Any node A in H(k,u,m,v,n) can be encoded as (i, j), where i(i=i1i2…in, 0 ≤ i1,i2,…in ≤ v-1) is the In-Cluster-HypercubeNode-Code of node A, and j(j=j1j2…jm, 0 ≤ j1,j2,…jm ≤ u-1) is the Out-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Code of node A. Obviously, the H(k,u,m,v,n) model has the following good properties: Property 1: The diameter of H(k,u,m,v,n) model is m+n. Proof: Since the diameter of n-dimensional hypercube is n, and the diameter of m-dimensional hypercube is m, so it is easy to know that the diameter of H(k,u,m,v,n) model is m+n from the definition 5. Property 2: The distance between any two nodes A(i1, j1) and B(i2, j2) in H(k,u,m,v,n) model is d(A,B)= dh(i1, i2)+dh(j1, j2), where dh represents the Hamming distance. Proof: Since the distance between any two nodes in hypercube equals to the Hamming distance between them, so it is obvious that the theorem 2s conclusion stands from definition 5. 5. MAPPING CLUSTERS DEPLOYED SENSOR NETWORKS TO H(K,U,M,V,N) Obviously, from the description in section 3 and 4, we can know that the clusters deployed sensor network can be mapped into a klevels- hierarchical hypercube model as follows: At first, the k clusters in the sensor network can be mapped into k different levels (or hypercubes) in the k-levels- hierarchical hypercube model. Then, the sensor nodes in each cluster can be encoded with the In-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes, and the sensor nodes in the k different clusters with the same In-ClusterHypercube-Node-Codes can be encoded with the Out-ClusterHypercube-Node-Codes according to the definition 5 respectively. Consequently, the whole sensor network has been mapped into a k-levels- hierarchical hypercube model. 6. H(K,U,M,V,N) MODEL-BASED PAIRWISE KEY PREDISTRIBUTION ALGORITHM FOR SENSOR NETWORKS In order to overcome the drawbacks of polynomial-based and polynomial pool-based key predistribution algorithms, this paper proposed an innovative H(k,u,m,v,n) model-based key predistribution scheme and pairwise key establishment algorithm, which combines the advantages of polynomial-based and key pool-based encryption schemes, and is based on the KDC and polynomials pool-based key predistribution models. The new H(k,u,m,v,n) model-based pairwise key establishment algorithm includes three main steps: (1) Generation of the polynomials pool and key predistribution, (2) Direct pairwise key discovery, (3) Path key discovery. 6.1 Generation of Polynomials Pool and Key Predistribution Supposing that, the sensor network includes N nodes, and is deployed through k different rounds. Then we can predistribute keys for each sensor node on the basis of the H(k,u,m,v,n) model as follows: Step 1: Key setup server randomly generates a bivariate polynomials pool such as the following: F={ f i iiil n >< −121 ,...,,, (x,y), f j jjjinii m >< −121 ,...,,,,...,2,1 (x,y) | 0 ≤ iii n 121 ... −≤≤≤ ≤ v-1, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ k; 0 ≤ jjj m 121 ... −≤≤≤ ≤ u-1 , 1 ≤ j ≤ m} with vn *m*um-1 +[N/vn ]*n*vn-1 different t-degree bivariate polynomials over a finite field Fq, and then assigns a unique polynomial ID to each bivariate polynomial in F. Step 2: In each round, key setup server assigns a unique node ID: (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) to each sensor node from small to big, where 0 ≤ i1,i2,…in ≤ v-1, 0 ≤ j1,j2,…jm ≤ u-1. Step 3: key setup server assigns a unique cluster ID: l to all the sensor nodes deployed in the same round, where 1 ≤ l ≤ k. Step 4: key setup server predistributes m+n bivariate polynomials { f iiil n 1 ,...,,, 32 >< (i1,y),…, f n iiil n >< −121 ,...,,, (in,y); f jjinii m 1 ,...,,,...,2,1 2 >< ( j1,y),…, f m jjinii m >< −11 ,...,,,...,2,1 ( jm,y) } and the corresponding polynomial IDs to the sensor node deployed in the lth round and with ID (i1i2…in, j1j2…jm). 6.2 Direct Pairwise Key Discovery If the node A(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) in the sensor network wants to establish pairwise key with a node B (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), then node A can establish pairwise key with the node B trough the following methods. Firstly, node A computes out the distance between itself and node B: d= d1+ d2, where d1=dh(i1i2…in, i1i2…in) and d2=dh(j1j2…jm, j1j2…jm). If d=1, then node A obtains the direct pairwise key between itself and node B according to the following theorem 1: Theorem 1: For any two sensor nodes A(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) and B (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) in the sensor network, supposing that the 56 distance between nodes A and B is d= d1+ d2, where d1=dh(i1i2…in, i1i2…in) and d2=dh(j1j2…jm, j1j2…jm). If d=1, then there exists a direct pairwise key between nodes A and B. Poof: Since d=1, then there is d1=1, d2=0, or d1=0, d2=1. 1) If d1=1, d2=0: From d2=0, there is nodes A, B belong to the same cluster. Supposing that nodes A, B belong to the same cluster l, then from d1=1 ⇒ There is only one position different between i1i2…in and i1i2…in. Let it=it, when 1 ≤ t ≤ n-1, and in ≠ in ⇒ f n iiil n >< −121 ,...,,, (in,in)= f n iiil n >′′′< −121 ,...,,, (in,in). So, there exists a direct pairwise key f n iiil n >< −121 ,...,,, (in,in) between nodes A and B. 2) If d1=0, d2=1: From d2=1 ⇒ There is only one position different between j1j2…jm and j1j2…jm. Let jt=jt, when 1 ≤ t ≤ m1, and jm ≠ jm. Since d1=0 ⇒ i1i2…in equals to i1i2…in ⇒ f m jjjinii m >< −121 ,...,,,,...,2,1 (jm, jm)= f m jjji nii m >′′′′′′< −121 ,...,,,,...,2,1 (jm,jm). So, there exists a direct pairwise key f m jjjinii m >< −121 ,...,,,,...,2,1 (jm, jm) between nodes A and B. According to theorem 1, we present the detailed description of the direct pairwise key discovery algorithm as follows: Step 1: Obtain the node IDs and cluster IDs of the source node A and destination node B; Step 2: Compute out the distance between nodes A and B: d= d1+ d2; Step 3: If d1=1, d2=0, then select out a common polynomial share of nodes A and B from { f iiil n 1 ,...,,, 32 >< ,..., f n iiil n >< −121 ,...,,, } to establish direct pairwise key; Step 4: If d1=0, d2=1, then select out a common polynomial share of nodes A and B from { f jjinii m 1 ,...,,,...,2,1 2 >< ,..., f m jjjinii m >< −121 ,...,,,,...,2,1 } to establish direct pairwise key; Step 5: Otherwise, there exists no direct pairwise key between nodes A and B. And then turn to the following path key discovery process. 6.3 Path Key Discovery If d>1, then node A can establish path key with node B according to the following theorem 2: Theorem 2: For any two sensor nodes A(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) and B (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) in the sensor network, supposing that the distance between nodes A and B is d= d1+ d2, where d1=dh(i1i2…in, i1i2…in) and d2=dh(j1j2…jm, j1j2…jm). If d>1, then there exists a path key between nodes A and B. Proof: Let d1=a, d2=b, then we can think that it ≠ it, when 1 ≤ t ≤ a; but it=it, when t>a; and jt ≠ jt, when 1 ≤ t ≤ b; but jt=jt, when t>b. Obviously, nodes A(i1i2…in, j1j2…jm) ,(i1i2 i3…in, j1j2…jm),(i1i2 i3…in, j1j2…jm),…,(i1i2…in, j1j2…jm) belong to the same cluster. So, according to the supposing condition of The nodes in the same cluster form a connected graph, there is a route among those nodes. In addition, in those nodes, the distance between any two neighboring nodes is 1, so from theorem 1, it is easy to know that there exists direct pairwise key between any two neighboring nodes among those nodes. For nodes (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), (i1i2…in,j1 j2 j3…jm), (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm-1 jm),…, (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm-1jm), since they have the same Out-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes with the node B(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), so nodes (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), (i1i2…in,j1 j2 j3…jm), (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm-1 jm),…, (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm-1 jm) and node B belong to a same logical hypercube. Obviously, from the supposing condition of The whole sensor network forms a connected graph, there is a route among those nodes. In addition, in those nodes, the distance between any two neighboring nodes is 1, so from theorem 1, it is easy to know that there exists direct pairwise key between any two neighboring nodes among those nodes. So, it is obvious that there exists a path key between nodes A and B. According to theorem 2, we present the detailed description of the path key discovery algorithm as follows: Step 1: Compute out the intermediate nodes (i1i2 i3…in,j1j2…jm), (i1i2 i3…in,j1j2…jm),…,(i1i2…in, j1j2…jm) and (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm), (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm-1 jm),…,(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm-1 jm) from the source node A(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) and the destination node B (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm). Step 2: In those nodes series A(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), (i1i2 i3…in,j1j2…jm), (i1i2 i3…in,j1j2…jm),…,(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) and (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm), (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm-1 jm),…, (i1i2…in, j1j2…jm-1 jm), B (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), the neighboring nodes select their common polynomial share to establish direct pairwise key. From theorem 2, it is easy to know that any source node A can compute out a key path P to the destination node B according to the above algorithm, when there are no compromised nodes in the sensor network. Once the key path P is computed out, then node A can send messages to B along the path P to establish indirect pairwise key with node B. Fig.2 presents a example of key path establishment. Figure.2 Key path establishment example. For example: In the above Figure.2, node A((012),(1234)) can establish pairwise key with node B((121),(2334)) through the following key path: A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) → E((121),(1234)) → F((121),(2234)) → B((121),(2334)), where node F shall route through nodes G, H, I, J to establish direct pairwise key with node B. 57 According to the properties of H(k,u,m,v,n) model, we can prove that the following theorem by combing the proof of theorem 2: Theorem 3: Supposing that there exist no compromised nodes in the sensor network, and the distance between node A and B, then there exists a shortest key path with k distance between node A and B logically. That is to say, node A can establish indirect pairwise key with node B through t-1 intermediate nodes. Proof: Supposing that the distance between node A(i1i2…in, j1j2…jm) and B (i1i2…in, j1j2…jm) is d=d1+ d2, where d1=dh(i1i2…in, i1i2…in), d2=dh(j1j2…jm, j1j2…jm). Since d=t, according to the construction properties of H(k,u,m,v,n), it is easy to know that there exist t-1 intermediate nodes I1,…,It-1, in the logical space H(k,u,m,v,n), which satisfy that the distance between any two neighboring nodes in the nodes series A, I1,…,It1, B equals to 1. So according to the theorem 1, we can know that nodes A, I1,…,It-1, B form a correct key path between node A and B. If any two neighboring nodes in the nodes series A, I1,…,It-1, B can communicate directly, then node A can establish indirect pairwise key with node B through those t-1 intermediate nodes. 6.4 Dynamic Path Key Discovery The path key discovery algorithm proposed in the above section can establish a key path correctly, only when there exist no compromised nodes in the whole sensor network, since the key path is computed out beforehand. And the proposed algorithm cannot find an alternative key path when there exist some compromised nodes or some intermediate nodes not in the communication radius, even that there exists other alternative key paths in the sensor network. From the following example we can know that there are many parallel paths in the H(k,u,m,v,n) model for any two given source and destination nodes, since the H(k,u,m,v,n) model is high fault-tolerant[9,10] . Figure.3 Alternative key path establishment example. For example: Considering the key path establishment example given in the above section based on Figure.2: A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) → E((121),(1234)) → F((121),(2234)) → B((121),(2334)), supposing that node F((121),(2234)) has compromised, then from Figure.3, we can know that there exists another alternative key path as A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) →E((121),(1234)) → M((121),(1334)) → B((121),(2334)), which can be used to establish the indirect pairwise key between node A and B, where node E shall route through nodes D and K to establish direct pairwise key with node M, and node M shall route through nodes N, O, G, H, I, J to establish direct pairwise key with node B. Since the sensors are source limited, so they are easy to die or out of the communication radius, therefore the algorithm proposed in the above section cannot guarantee to establish correct key path efficiently. In this section, we will propose a dynamic path key discovery algorithm as follows, which can improve the probability of key path effectively: Algorithm I: Dynamic key path establishment algorithm based on H(k,u,m,v,n) model for cluster deployed sensor networks. Input: Sub-sensor network H(k,u,m,v,n), which has some compromised /fault sensors and fault links, And two reachable nodes A(a1…an,a1…am) and B(b1…bn,b1…bm) in H(k,u,m,v,n), where at ≠ bt, t∈[1,s], at=bt, t >s. Output: A correct key path from node A to B in H(k,u,m,v,n). Step 1: Obtain the code strings of node A and B: A ← (a1…an,a1…am), B ← (b1…bn,b1…bm), where aj, bj [0,∈ u-1], aj, bj [0,∈ v-1]. Step 2: If a1…am = b1…bm, then node A can find a route to B according to the routing algorithms of hypercube [9-10]. Step 3: Otherwise, node A can find a route to C(b1…bn, a1…am) according to the Algorithm I or Algorithm II. Then let I0=C(b1…bn,a1…am), I1=(b1…bn,b1 a2…am),…, Is=B(b1…bn,b1 b2…bs as+1…am), and each node It in the above nodes series find a route to its neighboring node It+1 on the basis of the location information (Detailed routing algorithms based on location information can see the references[11-14]). Step 4: Algorithm exits. If such kind of a correct key path exists, then through which node A can establish an indirect pairwise key with node B. Otherwise, node A fails to establish an indirect pairwise key with node B. And node A will tries again to establish an indirect pairwise key with node B some time later. 7. ALGORITHM ANALYSES 7.1 Practical Analyses According to the former description and analyses, it is easy to know that the above newly proposed algorithm has the following properties: Property 3: When there exist no fault and compromised nodes, by using new pairwise key predistribution scheme based on H(k,u,m,v,n) model, the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes can be estimated as P=(m(u-1)+n(v-1))/(N-1), where N is the total number of nodes in the sensor network, and N=um * vn . Proof: Since the predistributed pairwise keys for any node FA ={ f iiil n 1 ,...,,, 32 >< (i1,y),…, f n iiil n >< −121 ,...,,, (in,y); f jjinii m 1 ,...,,,...,2,1 2 >< (j1 ,y),…, f m jjinii m >< −11 ,...,,,...,2,1 ( jm,y) } in the newly proposed algorithm. Obviously, in the logical hypercube formed by the nodes in the same cluster of node A, there are n(v-1) nodes, which 58 have direct pairwise key with node A. And in the logical hypercube formed by the nodes in different clusters from that of node A, there are m(u-1) nodes, which have direct pairwise key with node A. Therefore, there are totally m(u-1)+n(v-1) nodes, which have direct pairwise key with node A. So, the probability of pairwise key establishment between any two nodes can be estimated as P=(m(u-1)+n(v-1))/(N-1), since the whole sensor network has N sensor nodes in all. Figure.4 presents the comparision between the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes and the dimension n, when the sensor network has different total nodes, and use the new pairwise key predistribution scheme based on H(8,2,3,v,n) model. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01 Number of Dimension ProbabilitytoEstablishDirectKey N = 8000 N=10000 N=20000 N=30000 Figure.4 Comparision between the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes and the dimension n, when the sensor network has different total nodes, and use the new pairwise key predistribution scheme based on H(8,2,3,v,n) model. From Figure.4, it is easy to know that by using new pairwise key predistribution scheme based on H(k,u,m,v,n) model, the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes decreases with the increasing of the scale of the sensor networks, and in addition, the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes decreases with the increasing of the dimension n, when the scale of the sensor network is fixed. Theorem 4: Supposing that the total sensors is N in the sensor network, then when u ≥ v2 , the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes, when using the key distribution scheme based on the hypercube model H(v,p), is smaller than that when using the key distribution scheme based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model. Proof: Since u ≥ v, then we can let u=vt , where t ≥ 2. Since the total number of nodes in H(v,p) is vp =N, the total number of nodes in H(k,u,m,v,n) is um * vn =N. Let p=x+n, then there is um *vn = vx * vn ⇒ um =vx ⇒ x=tm. From the property 3, it is easy to know that the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes can be estimated as P=(m(u-1)+n(v-1))/(N-1). According to the description in [7], it is well know that the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes can be estimated as P= p(v-1)/(N-1)= (x(v-1)+n(v-1))/(N-1). Next, we will prove that m(u-1) ≥ x(v-1): m(u-1)= m(vt -1), x(v-1)= tm(v-1). Construct a function as f(t)= vt -1- t(v-1), where t ≥ 2. When t=2, it is obvious that there is f(t)= vt -2v+1=( v-1)2 ≥ 0 and f(t)=t vt-1 - v+1 ≥ 2v- v+1= v+1>0. So, there is f(t) ≥ 0 ⇒ vt -1 ≥ t(v-1) ⇒ m(vt -1) ≥ tm(v-1) ⇒ m(u1) ≥ x(v-1). Therefore, the conclusion of the theorem stands. As for the conclusion of theorem 4, we give an example to illustrate. Supposing that the total number of nodes in the sensor network is N=214 , and H(k,u,m,v,n)=H(16,4,2,2,10), H(v,p)= H(10,14), then the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model is P= (m(u-1)+n(v1))/(N-1)= (2(4-1)+10(2-1))/(214 -1)=16/(214 -1), but the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes based on the H(v,p) model is P= p(v-1)/(N-1)=14(2-1)/(214 -1)= 14/(214 1). Supposing that the total number of nodes in the sensor network is N, Figure.5 illustrates the comparison between the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model and the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes based on the H(v,p) model, when u=4 and v=2. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 x 10 -3 scaleofthesensornetwork ProbabilitytoEstablishDirectKey H(k,u,m,v,n)model-based H(v,p)model-based Figure.5 Comparison between the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between H(v,n) and H(k,u,m,v,n) models. From Figure.5, it is easy to know that the theorem 5 stands. Theorem 5: Supposing that the total sensors is N in the sensor network, then the pairwise key distribution scheme based on the hypercube model H(v,p), is only a special case of the pairwise key distribution scheme based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model. Proof: As for the pairwise key distribution scheme based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model, let k=1 (u=1, m=0), which means that the total sensor network includes only one cluster. Then obviously, the H(k,u,m,v,n) model will degrade into the H(v,n) model. According to the former anayses in this paper and the definition of the pairwise key distribution scheme based on the hypercube model H(v,p) in [7], it is easy to know that the conclusion of the theorem stands. 59 7.2 Security Analyses By using the pairwise key establishment algorithm based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model, the intruders can launch two kinds of attacks: 1) The attackers may target the pairwise key between two particular sensor node, in order to compromise the pairwise key between them, or prevent them to establish pairwise key. 2) The attackers may attack against the whole sensor network, inorder to decrease the probability of the pairwise key establishment, or increase the cost of the pairwise key establishment. Attacks against a Pair of sensor nodes 1. Supposing that the intruders want to attack two particular sensor nodes u,v, where u,v are all not compromised nodes, but the intruders want to compromise the pairwise key between them. 1) If u,v can establish direct pairwise key, then the only way to compromise the key is to compromise the common bivariate polynomial f(x,y) between u,v. Since the degree of the bivariate polynomial f(x,y) is t, so the intruders need to compromise at least t+1 sensor nodes that have a share of the bivariate polynomial f(x,y). 2) If u,v can establish indirect pairwise key through intermediate nodes, then the intruders need to compromise at least one intermediate node, or compromise the common bivariate polynomial f(x,y) between two neighboring intermediate nodes. But even if the intruders succeed to do that, node u and v can still reestablish indirect pairwise key through alternative intermediate nodes. 2. Supposing that the intruders want to attack two particular sensor nodes u,v, where u,v are all not compromised nodes, but the intruders want to prevent them to establish the pairwise key. Then, the intruders need to compromise all of the m+n bivariate polynomials of node u or v. Since the degree of the bivariate polynomial f(x,y) is t, so for bivariate polynomial, the intruders need to compromise at least t+1 sensor nodes that have a share of the given bivariate polynomial. Therefore, the intruders need to compromise (m+n)(t+1) sensor nodes altogether to prevent u,v to establish the pairwise key. Attacks against the sensor network Supposing that the Attackers know the distribution of the polynomials over sensor nodes, it may systematically attack the network by compromising the polynomials in F one by one in order to compromise the entire network. Assume the fraction of the compromised polynomials is pc, then there are up to N=pc × { vn v N umv n n mn ××+×× ][ }= pc ××N (m+n) Sensor nodes that have at least one compromised polynomial share. Among all of the remaining N- N sensor nodes, none of them includes a compromised polynomial share. So, the remaining N- N sensor nodes can establish direct pairwise key by using any one of their polynomial shares. However, the indirect pairwise keys in the remaining N- N sensor nodes may be affected. And they may need to re-establish a new indirect pairwise key between them by select alternative intermediate nodes that do not belong to the N compromised nodes. Supposing that the scale of the sensor network is N=10000, Figure.6 presents the comparison between pc and the number of sensor nodes with at least one compromised polynomial share in sensor networks based on different H(k,u,m,v,n) distribution models. From Figure.6, it is easy to know that, when the scale of the sensor network is fixed, the number of the affected sensor nodes in the sensor network increases with the increasing of the number of compromised nodes. 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 F rac tion of C om prom is ed B ivariate P oly nom ialsSensorNodeswithatleastoneCompromisedPolynomialShare H (1,0,0,100,2) H (2,2,1,71,2) H (4,2,2,50,2) H (8,2,3,36,2) Figure.6 the comparison between pc and the number of sensor nodes with at least one compromised polynomial share in sensor networks based on different H(k,u,m,v,n) distribution models. Theorem 6: Supposing that the total sensors is N in the sensor network, and the fraction of compromised nodes is pc, then when u>v, the number of affected nodes of the H(v,p) model based key predistribution scheme, is bigger than that of the H(k,u,m,v,n) model based key predistribution scheme. Proof: Since the number of affected nodes of the H(k,u,m,v,n) model based key predistribution scheme is pc ××N (m+n), and it is proved in [7] that the number of affected nodes of the H(v,p) model based key predistribution scheme is pc ××N p. Let p=x+n, then there is um * vn = vx * vn ⇒ um =vx . Since u>v ⇒ x>m ⇒ pc ××N (m+n)< pc ××N (x+n)= pc ××N p. Supposing that the scale of the sensor network is N=10000, Figure.7 presents the comparison between pc and the number of sensor nodes with at least one compromised polynomial share in sensor networks based on H(9,3,2,2,n) and H(2,p) distribution models. From Figure.7, it is easy to know that the conclusion of theorem 9 is correct, and the number of the affected sensor nodes in the sensor network increases with the increasing of the number of compromised nodes, when the scale of the sensor network is fixed. 60 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.1 0.11 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 Fraction of Compromised Bivariate Polynomials SensorNodeswithatleastoneCompromisedPolynomialShare H(9,3,2,34,2) H(16,4,2,25,2) H(225,15,2,7,2) H(1296,36,2,3,2) H(2,14) Figure.7 the comparison between pc and the number of sensor nodes with at least one compromised polynomial share in sensor networks based on H(9,3,2,2,n) and H(2,p) distribution models. 8. CONCLUSION A new hierarchical hypercube model named H(k,u,m,v,n) is proposed, which can be used for pairwise key predistribution for cluster deployed sensor networks. And Based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model, an innovative pairwise key predistribution scheme and algorithm are designed respectively, by combing the good properties of the Polynomial Key and Key Pool encryption schemes. The new algorithm uses the good characteristics of node codes and high fault-tolerance of H(k,u,m,v,n) model to route and predistribute pairwise keys, in which nodes are not needed to be able to communicate with each other directly such as that the algorithms proposed by [7] shall need. So, the traditional pairwise key predistribution algorithm based on hypercube model [7] is only a special case of the new algorithm proposed in this paper. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that the newly proposed algorithm is an efficient pairwise key establishment algorithm that is suitable for the cluster deployed sensor networks. 9.

Categorías y descriptores de sujetos C.2.4 [Networks de comunicación informática]: aplicaciones distribuidas de sistemas distribuidos. Términos generales: seguridad.1. Introducción La comunicación de seguridad es un requisito importante en muchas aplicaciones de redes de sensores, por lo que se utilizan claves secretas compartidas entre los nodos comunicantes para cifrar datos. Como uno de los servicios de seguridad más fundamentales, el establecimiento clave por pares permite que los nodos sensores se comuniquen de forma segura entre sí utilizando técnicas criptográficas. Sin embargo, debido a las capacidades computacionales limitadas de los nodos sensores, la energía de la batería y la memoria disponible, no es factible que utilicen técnicas de establecimiento de clave de pareja tradicionales, como la criptografía de clave pública y el Centro de distribución de claves (KDC). Recientemente se han desarrollado varios enfoques alternativos para realizar un establecimiento clave por pares en redes de sensores limitadas por recursos sin implicar el uso de la criptografía tradicional [14]. Eschenauer y Gligor propusieron un esquema de predistribución de clave probabilística básica para el establecimiento de clave por pares [1]. En el esquema, cada nodo del sensor elige aleatoriamente un conjunto de claves de un grupo de claves antes de la implementación para que cualquiera de los dos nodos del sensor tenga una cierta probabilidad de compartir al menos una clave común. Chan et al.Extendió aún más esta idea y presentó dos esquemas clave de predistribución: un esquema de predistribución clave de Q-Composite y un esquema de claves aleatorias por pares. El esquema Q-Composite requiere que dos sensores compartan al menos q claves predistribuidas. El esquema aleatorio elige aleatoriamente un par de sensores y asigna a cada par una clave aleatoria única [2]. Inspirado en los estudios anteriores y el protocolo de pre-distribución clave basado en polinomio [3], Liu et al.desarrolló aún más la idea abordada en los trabajos anteriores y propuso un marco general de predistribución clave basada en el grupo polinomial [4]. La idea básica puede considerarse como la combinación de la pre-distribución clave basada en polinomio y la idea de grupo clave utilizada en [1]] y [2]. Basado en dicho marco, presentaron dos esquemas de distribución previa por pares por pares: un esquema de asignación de subconjunto aleatorio y un esquema basado en la cuadrícula. Se utiliza un grupo polinomial en esos esquemas, en lugar de usar un grupo clave en las técnicas anteriores. El esquema de asignación de subconjunto aleatorio asigna a cada nodo del sensor los secretos generados a partir de un subconjunto aleatorio de polinomios en el grupo polinomial. El esquema basado en la cuadrícula asocia polinomios con las filas y las columnas de una cuadrícula artificial, asigna cada nodo del sensor a una coordenada única en la cuadrícula y le da al nodo los secretos generados a partir de los polinomios de fila y columna correspondientes. Según esta cuadrícula, cada nodo del sensor puede identificar si puede establecer directamente una tecla de pareja con otro nodo, y si no, qué nodos intermedios puede contactar para establecer indirectamente la tecla pares. Un enfoque similar a los esquemas descritos por Liu et al fue desarrollado independientemente por Du et a.[5]. En lugar de en el esquema Blundos, su enfoque se basa en el esquema BLOMS [6]. En algunos casos, es esencialmente equivalente al de [4]. Todos los esquemas anteriores mejoran la seguridad sobre el esquema de predistribución de clave probabilística básica. Sin embargo, el problema de establecimiento clave por pares en las redes de sensores todavía no está bien resuelto. Para los esquemas de predistribución de la clave probabilística básica y compuesta Q, a medida que aumenta el número de nodos comprometidos, la fracción de claves por pares afectadas aumenta rápidamente. Como resultado, un pequeño número de nodos comprometidos puede afectar una gran fracción de claves por pares [3]. Aunque el esquema de claves por pares aleatorias no sufren del problema de seguridad anterior, incurre en una sobrecarga de memoria alta, que aumenta linealmente con el número de nodos en la red si el nivel de seguridad se mantiene constante [2] [4]. Para el esquema de asignación de subconjuntos aleatorios, sufre más gastos generales de comunicación y cálculo. En 2004, Liu propuso un nuevo esquema de predistribución de clave pares basado en hipercubos [7], que extiende el esquema basado en la red de una cuadrícula bidimensional a un hipercubo multidimensional. El análisis muestra que el esquema basado en hipercubos mantiene algunas propiedades atractivas del esquema basado en la cuadrícula, incluida la garantía de establecer claves por pares y la resiliencia a los compromisos de nodo. Además, cuando se requiere una seguridad perfecta contra el compromiso del nodo, el esquema basado en hipercubos puede admitir una red más grande al agregar más dimensiones en lugar de aumentar la sobrecarga de almacenamiento en los nodos del sensor. Aunque el esquema basado en hipercubos (consideramos que el esquema basado en la cuadrícula es un caso especial de esquema basado en hipercubos) tiene muchas propiedades atractivas, requiere que dos nodos en las redes de sensores puedan comunicarse directamente entre sí. Esta fuerte suposición no es práctica en la mayoría de las aplicaciones reales de las redes de sensores. En este documento, presentamos un tipo de nuevo modelo de distribución basado en clúster de redes de sensores, y para el cual, proponemos un nuevo esquema de predistribución clave de la clave. Las principales contribuciones de este documento son las siguientes: combinar el conocimiento de la implementación de las redes de sensores y la predistribución clave basada en el grupo polinomial, configuramos una topología basada en clúster que es práctica con la implementación real de redes de sensores. Basado en la topología, proponemos un nuevo modelo jerárquico de hipercubos basado en distribución de clúster para establecer la clave por pares. La contribución clave es que la dosis del esquema no requiere la suposición de todos los nodos puede comunicarse directamente entre sí como lo hacen los esquemas anteriores, y aún mantiene una alta probabilidad de establecimiento clave, sobrecarga de baja memoria y buen rendimiento de seguridad. Desarrollamos un tipo de algoritmo de establecimiento clave nuevo por pares con nuestro modelo jerárquico de hipercubos. La estructura de este documento se organiza de la siguiente manera: en la Sección 3, se presenta un nuevo modelo de distribución de redes de sensores implementadas de clúster. En la Sección 4, se propone un nuevo modelo jerárquico de hipercubos. En la Sección 5, se discute la relación de mapeo entre la red de sensores implementadas y el modelo jerárquico de hipercubos. En la Sección 6 y la Sección 7, el nuevo algoritmo de establecimiento clave por pares se diseñan en base al modelo jerárquico de hipercubos y se describen análisis detallados. Finalmente, la Sección 8 presenta una conclusión.2. Definición preliminar 1 (predistribución clave): el procedimiento, que se utiliza para codificar los algoritmos de cifrado y descifrado correspondientes en los nodos del sensor antes de la distribución, se denomina predistribución clave. Definición 2 (clave por pares): para dos nodos A y B, si tienen una clave E común, entonces la clave E se llama clave a pareja entre ellos. Definición 3 (ruta clave): para dos nodos A0 y AK, cuando no hay una clave por pares entre ellos, si existe una ruta A0, A1, A2, ......, AK-1, AK, y existe al menosUna clave por pares entre los nodos AI y AJ para 0≤i≤k-1 y 1≤j≤k, entonces la ruta consistió en A0, A1, A2, ......, AK-1, AK se llama un camino clave entre A0y ak. Definición 4 (Hipercube N-dimensional): un hipercubo N-dimensional (o n-cubo) H (V, N) es una topología con las siguientes propiedades: (1) consiste en bordes N · VN-1, (2) Cada nodo se puede codificar como una cadena con n posiciones como b1b2 ... bn, donde 0≤b1, b2, ..., bn≤v-1, (3) cualquiera de los dos nodos se llaman vecinos, lo que significa que hay una ventajaEntre ellos, si solo hay una posición diferente entre sus códigos de nodo.3. Modelo de clústeres implementados redes de sensores En algunas aplicaciones reales de redes de sensores, los sensores se pueden implementar a través de aviones. Suponiendo que las rondas de implementación de los sensores son K, y el radio de comunicación de cualquier sensor es R, entonces los sensores desplegados en la misma ronda pueden considerarse que pertenecen a un mismo clúster. Asignamos un número de clúster único L (1 ≤ l ≤ k) para cada clúster. Suponiendo que los sensores formen un gráfico conectado en cualquier clúster después de la implementación a través de aviones, y luego la Fig.1 presenta un modelo real de clústeres implementadas redes de sensores. Figura.1 Un modelo real de clústeres implementadas redes de sensores. De la Figura 1, es fácil saber que, para un nodo A dado, existen muchos nodos en el mismo clúster de A, que se puede comunicar directamente con A, ya que los nodos se implementan densamente en un clúster. Pero existen muchos menos nodos en un clúster vecino del clúster de A, que se puede comunicar directamente con A. ya que los dos grupos no se implementan al mismo tiempo.4. Definición del modelo de hipercubos jerárquicos 5 (K-Levels Hercube jerárquico): Deje que hay N nodos totalmente, luego un hipercubo jerárquico jerárquico llamado H (K, U, M, V, N) se puede construir de la siguiente manera: 1) El NLos nodos se dividen en clústeres k promedio, y los nodos [n/k] en cualquier clúster están conectados a un hipercubo n-dimensional: en el hipercubo n-dimensional, cualquier nodo se codifica 55 como i1i2 ... en, que se llaman internoCódigos de nodo de clúster-hypercube, donde 0 ≤ i1, i2, ... en ≤ v-1, v = [n kn /], [j] es igual a un entero no menos que j. Entonces podemos obtener k este tipo de hipercubos diferentes.2) Los k diferentes hipercubos obtenidos anteriormente están codificados como J1J2 ... JM, que se denominan código de nodo-hypercube Out-Cluster-Hypercube, donde 0 ≤ J1, J2, ... JM ≤ U-1, U = [M K]. Y los nodos en K diferentes hipercubos están conectados a hipercubos M-dimensionales de acuerdo con las siguientes reglas: los nodos con los mismos códigos de nodo de hypercube en clúster y diferentes códigos de nodos fuera de clusterHypercube.(El gráfico construido a través de los pasos anteriores se llama Hipercube jerárquico de niveles K abreviado como H (K, U, M, V, N).) 3) Cualquier nodo A en H (K, U, M, V, N) CANestar codificado como (i, j), donde i (i = i1i2 ... en, 0 ≤ i1, i2, ... en ≤ v-1) es el código de clúster-hypercubenode del nodo A y J (j = j1j2... JM, 0 ≤ J1, J2, ... JM ≤ U-1) es el código de nodo de clúster-hypercube del nodo A. Obviamente, el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N) tiene las siguientes buenas propiedades: Propiedad 1: El diámetro del modelo H (K, U, M, V, N) es M+N. Prueba: Dado que el diámetro del hipercubo N-dimensional es N, y el diámetro del hipercubo M-dimensional es M, por lo que es fácil saber que el diámetro del modelo H (K, U, M, V, N) es M+n de la definición 5. Propiedad 2: La distancia entre dos nodos A (I1, J1) y B (I2, J2) en H (K, U, M, V, N) es D (A, B) = DH (I1, I2)+DH (J1, J2), donde DH representa la distancia de Hamming. Prueba: Dado que la distancia entre dos nodos en Hypercube es igual a la distancia de Hamming entre ellos, por lo que es obvio que la conclusión del Teorema 2S se destaca de la definición 5. 5. Mapeo de clústeres implementados redes de sensores a H (K, U, M, V, N) Obviamente, a partir de la descripción en la Sección 3 y 4, podemos saber que los grupos de la red de sensores implementados se pueden asignar en un modelo de hipercubos jerárquico de Klevels-jerárquico de la siguiente manera: Al principio, los grupos K en la red de sensores se pueden asignar en K diferentes niveles (o hipercubos) en el modelo de hipercubos jerárquicos de niveles K. Luego, los nodos del sensor en cada clúster se pueden codificar con los códigos de nodo-hypercube en clúster, y los nodos del sensor en los clústeres K diferentes con los mismos codos de nodo en clusterhypercube se pueden codificar con el clusterhypercube-Node-codes de acuerdo con la definición 5 respectivamente. En consecuencia, toda la red de sensores se ha asignado a un modelo de hipercubos jerárquico de niveles K.6. H (K, U, M, V, N) Algoritmo de predistribución de clave pares basado en el modelo para redes de sensores Para superar los inconvenientes de los algoritmos de predistribución clave basados en el grupo polinomial y polinómico, este documento propuso una in innovadora H (K,U, M, V, N) Esquema de predistribución clave basado en modelos y algoritmo de establecimiento clave de pares, que combina las ventajas de los esquemas de encriptación basados en el grupo basados en polinomios y clave, y se basa en los modelos de predistribución clave basados en KDC y Polynomials Bool.. El nuevo algoritmo de establecimiento de clave por pares basado en el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N) incluye tres pasos principales: (1) Generación del grupo de polinomios y predistribución clave, (2) Descubrimiento directo de clave por pares, (3) PathDescubrimiento clave.6.1 Generación del grupo de polinomios y predistribución clave Suponiendo que la red de sensores incluye n nodos, y se implementa a través de k diferentes rondas. Luego podemos predistribuir las claves para cada nodo del sensor sobre la base del modelo H (K, U, M, V, N) de la siguiente manera: Paso 1: El servidor de configuración de clave genera aleatoriamente un grupo de polinomios bivariados, como el siguiente: F = {f i iiil n> <−121, ... ,,, (x, y), f j jjjinii m> <−121, ... ,,,, ..., 2,1 (x, y) |0 ≤ III n 121 ... −≤≤≤ ≤ v-1, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ k;0 ≤ jjj m 121 ... −≤≤≤ ≤ u-1, 1 ≤ j ≤ m} con vn*m*um-1 +[n/vn]*n*vn-1 polinomios bivariados diferentes de thegreun campo finito FQ, y luego asigna una ID polinomial única a cada polinomio bivariado en F. Paso 2: En cada ronda, el servidor de configuración clave asigna una ID de nodo única: (I1i2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM) a cada nodo del sensor desde un pequeño nodo del sensora grande, donde 0 ≤ i1, i2, ... en ≤ v-1, 0 ≤ j1, j2, ... jm ≤ u-1. Paso 3: El servidor de configuración de clave asigna una ID de clúster única: L a todos los nodos del sensor implementados en la misma ronda, donde 1 ≤ l ≤ k.Paso 4: El servidor de configuración de clave predistributos M+n polinomios bivariados {f iiil n 1, ... ,,, 32> <(i1, y), ..., f n iiil n> <−121, ... ,,, ((((((en, y);f JJinii M 1, ... ,,, ..., 2,1 2> <(J1, Y), ..., F M JJinii M> <−11, ... ,,, ..., 2,1(JM, Y)} y las ID de polinomio correspondientes al nodo del sensor desplegado en la ronda LTH y con ID (I1I2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM).6.2 Descubrimiento directo de la clave por pares si el nodo A (I1I2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM) en la red de sensores quiere establecer la tecla pares con un nodo B (I1I2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM), entonces el nodo A puede establecer la tecla de pareja con la tecla de pareja con elNodo B Corte los siguientes métodos. En primer lugar, el nodo A calcula la distancia entre sí mismo y el nodo B: d = d1+ d2, donde d1 = dh (i1i2 ... en, i1i2 ... in) y d2 = dh (j1j2 ... jm, j1j2 ... jm). Si d = 1, entonces el nodo A obtiene la clave directa por pares entre sí y el nodo B de acuerdo con el siguiente teorema 1: Teorema 1: para cualquier dos nodos de sensor A (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 ... jm) y b (i1i2 ... in,J1J2 ... JM) En la red de sensores, suponiendo que la distancia 56 entre los nodos A y B es D = D1+ D2, donde D1 = DH (I1i2 ... en, I1i2 ... en) y D2 = Dh (J1J2 ... JM, J1J2 ... JM ...). Si d = 1, entonces existe una clave directa por pares entre nodos A y B. POOF: Dado que d = 1, entonces hay d1 = 1, d2 = 0 o d1 = 0, d2 = 1.1) Si d1 = 1, d2 = 0: de d2 = 0, hay nodos A, B pertenecen al mismo clúster. Suponiendo que los nodos A, B pertenecen al mismo clúster L, luego de D1 = 1 ⇒ solo hay una posición diferente entre i1i2 ... en e i1i2 ... en. Permítelo = cuando 1 ≤ t ≤ n-1, y en ≠ en ⇒ f n iiil n> <−121, ... ,,, (in, in) = f n iiil n> ′ ′ ′ <−121,...,,, (en en). Entonces, existe una clave directa por pares f n iiil n> <−121, ... ,,, (in, in) entre los nodos a y B. 2) si d1 = 0, d2 = 1: de d2 = 1 ⇒ allíes solo una posición diferente entre J1J2 ... JM y J1J2 ... JM. Déjalo = cuando 1 ≤ t ≤ m1 y jm ≠ jm. Dado que d1 = 0 ⇒ i1i2 ... en igual a i1i2 ... en ⇒ f m jjjinii m> <−121, ... ,,,, ..., 2,1 (jm, jm) = f m jjji nii m> ′ ′ ′′ ′ ′ <−121, ... ,,,,, ..., 2,1 (JM, JM). Entonces, existe una clave directa por pares f m jjjinii m> <−121, ... ,,,, ..., 2,1 (JM, JM) entre los nodos A y B. Según el Teorema 1, presentamos la descripción detallada del algoritmo de descubrimiento de clave por pares directo de la siguiente manera: Paso 1: Obtenga los ID de nodo y los ID de clúster del nodo de origen A y el nodo de destino B;Paso 2: Calcule la distancia entre los nodos A y B: D = D1+ D2;Paso 3: si D1 = 1, d2 = 0, luego seleccione una participación polinomial común de los nodos A y B de {f iiil n 1, ... ,,, 32> <, ..., f n iiil n> <−121, ... ,,,} para establecer la clave directa por pares;Paso 4: Si d1 = 0, d2 = 1, luego seleccione una participación polinomial común de los nodos A y B de {f Jjinii m 1, ... ,,, ..., 2,1 2> <, ..., f m jjjinii m> <−121, ... ,,,, ..., 2,1} para establecer una clave directa por pares;Paso 5: de lo contrario, no existe una clave directa por pares entre los nodos A y B. Y luego gire al siguiente proceso de descubrimiento de teclas de ruta.6.3 Descubrimiento de la clave de ruta Si d> 1, entonces el nodo A puede establecer la tecla de ruta con el nodo B de acuerdo con el siguiente teorema 2: Teorema 2: para cualquier dos nodos de sensor A (i1i2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM) y B (i1i2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM) en la red de sensores, suponiendo que la distancia entre los nodos A y B es D = D1+ D2, donde D1 = Dh (I1i2 ... en, I1i2 ... en) y D2 = Dh (J1J2 ... JM, J1J2 ...). Si d> 1, entonces existe una clave de ruta entre los nodos A y B. Prueba: Sea d1 = a, d2 = b, entonces podemos pensar que ≠ igu, cuando 1 ≤ t ≤ a;pero = él, cuando t> a;y jt ≠ jt, cuando 1 ≤ t ≤ b;pero jt = jt, cuando t> b. Obviamente, los nodos a (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 ... jm), (i1i2 i3 ... en, j1j2 ... jm), (i1i2 i3 ... en, j1j2 ... jm), ..., (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 ... jm) pertenecen a losmismo clúster. Entonces, de acuerdo con la condición de suposición de los nodos en el mismo clúster, forman un gráfico conectado, hay una ruta entre esos nodos. Además, en esos nodos, la distancia entre dos nodos vecinos es 1, por lo que del Teorema 1, es fácil saber que existe una clave directa por pares entre dos nodos vecinos entre esos nodos. Para nodos (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 ... jm), (i1i2 ... en, j1 j2 j3 ... jm), (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 j3 ... jm-1 jm), ..., (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 ... jm-1jm), ya que tienen los mismos códigos de nodo de clúster-hypercube con el nodo B (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 ... jm), así nodos (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 ... jm), (i1i2 ... en, j1 j2 j3... JM), (I1I2 ... en, J1J2 J3 ... JM-1 JM), ..., (I1I2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM-1 JM) y el nodo B pertenecen a un mismo hipercube lógico. Obviamente, desde la condición de suposición de toda la red de sensores forma un gráfico conectado, hay una ruta entre esos nodos. Además, en esos nodos, la distancia entre dos nodos vecinos es 1, por lo que del Teorema 1, es fácil saber que existe una clave directa por pares entre dos nodos vecinos entre esos nodos. Por lo tanto, es obvio que existe una clave de ruta entre los nodos A y B. Según el Teorema 2, presentamos la descripción detallada del algoritmo de descubrimiento de clave de ruta de la siguiente manera: Paso 1: Calcule los nodos intermedios (i1i2 i3 ... en, j1j2 ... jm), (i1i2 i3 ... en, j1j2 ... jm), ..., (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 ... jm) y (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 j3 ... jm), (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 j3 ... jm-1 jm), ..., (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 ... jm-1 jm)Desde el nodo fuente A (i1i2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM) y el nodo de destino B (I1I2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM). Paso 2: En esos nodos Serie A (I1I2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM), (I1I2 I3 ... en, J1J2 ... JM), (I1I2 I3 ... en, J1J2 ... JM), ..., (I1I2 ... en, J1J2 ...) y (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 j3 ... jm), (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 j3 ... jm-1 jm), ..., (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 ... jm-1 jm), b (i1i2 ... en, j1j2 ...JM), los nodos vecinos seleccionan su participación polinomial común para establecer la clave directa por pares. Desde el teorema 2, es fácil saber que cualquier nodo fuente A puede calcular una ruta clave P al nodo de destino B de acuerdo con el algoritmo anterior, cuando no hay nodos comprometidos en la red de sensores. Una vez que se calcula la ruta de la clave P, entonces el nodo A puede enviar mensajes a B a lo largo de la ruta P para establecer la clave indirecta por pares con el nodo B. Fig.2 presenta un ejemplo de establecimiento de ruta clave. Figura.2 Ejemplo de establecimiento de ruta clave. Por ejemplo: en la figura anterior.2, el nodo A ((012), (1234)) puede establecer la tecla pares con el nodo B ((121), (2334)) a través de la siguiente ruta clave: A ((012), (((1234)) → C ((112), (1234)) → D ((122), (1234)) → E ((121), (1234)) → F ((121), (2234)) → B ((121), (2334)), donde el nodo F enrutará a través de los nodos G, H, I, J para establecer la clave directa por pares con el nodo B. 57 según las propiedades de H (K, U, M, V, N)Modelo, podemos probar que el siguiente teorema peine la prueba del teorema 2: Teorema 3: Suponiendo que no existan nodos comprometidos en la red de sensores, y la distancia entre el nodo A y B existe una ruta clave más corta con kdistancia entre el nodo A y B lógicamente. Es decir, el nodo A puede establecer una clave de pareja indirecta con el nodo B a los nodos intermedios T-1. Prueba: suponiendo que la distancia entre el nodo A (I1i2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM) y B (I1I2 ... en, J1J2 ... JM) es D = D1+ D2, donde d1 = dh (i1i2 ... in, i1i2 ... in), d2, d2= DH (J1J2 ... JM, J1J2 ... JM). Dado que d = t, de acuerdo con las propiedades de construcción de h (k, u, m, v, n), es fácil saber que existen nodos intermedios T-1 i1, ..., it-1, en el espacio lógico h h(K, U, M, V, N), que satisface que la distancia entre dos nodos vecinos en los nodos A, i1, ..., It1, B es igual a 1. Entonces, según el Teorema 1, podemos saber que los nodos A, I1, ..., IT-1, B forman una ruta clave correcta entre el nodo A y B. Si cualquier dos nodos vecinos en los nodos A, I1, ..., IT-1, B pueden comunicarse directamente, entonces el nodo A puede establecer la clave indirecta por pares con el nodo B a través de esos nodos intermedios T-1.6.4 Descubrimiento de clave de ruta dinámica El algoritmo de descubrimiento de tecla de ruta propuesto en la sección anterior puede establecer una ruta clave correctamente, solo cuando no hay nodos comprometidos en toda la red de sensores, ya que la ruta clave se calcula de antemano. Y el algoritmo propuesto no puede encontrar una ruta clave alternativa cuando existen algunos nodos comprometidos o algunos nodos intermedios que no están en el radio de comunicación, incluso que existe otras rutas clave alternativas en la red de sensores. A partir del siguiente ejemplo, podemos saber que hay muchas rutas paralelas en el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N) para dos nodos de origen y destino dados, ya que H (K, U, M, V, N) El modelo es tolerante a fallas altas [9,10]. Figura.3 Ejemplo de establecimiento de ruta clave alternativa. Por ejemplo: considerando el ejemplo del establecimiento de la ruta clave dado en la sección anterior basado en la figura.2: A ((012), (1234)) → C ((112), (1234)) → D ((122), (1234)) → E ((121), (1234)) → F ((121), (2234)) → B ((121), (2334)), suponiendo que el nodo F ((121), (2234) tienecomprometido, luego de la figura 3, podemos saber que existe otra ruta clave alternativa como A ((012), (1234)) → C ((112), (1234)) → D ((122), (1234)) → E ((121), (1234)) → M ((121), (1334)) → B ((121), (2334)), que puede usarse para establecer la clave indirecta por pares entre el nodo A y B, donde el nodo E se enrutará a través de los nodos D y K para establecer la clave directa por pares con el nodo M, y el nodo M enrutará a través de los nodos N, O, G, H, I, J para establecer la tecla directa por pares con el nodo B. Dado que los sensores son de origen limitado, por lo que son fáciles de morir o fuera del radio de comunicación, por lo tanto, el algoritmo propuesto en la sección anterior no puede garantizar establecer una ruta clave correcta de manera eficiente. En esta sección, propondremos un algoritmo de descubrimiento de clave de ruta dinámica de la siguiente manera, lo que puede mejorar la probabilidad de una ruta clave de manera efectiva: Algoritmo I: algoritmo de establecimiento de ruta clave dinámica basado en H (k, u, m, v, n) para el modelo paraRedes de sensores implementadas de clúster. Entrada: Subsensor Network H (K, U, M, V, N), que tiene algunos sensores de falla comprometidos /de falla y enlaces de fallas, y dos nodos accesibles A (A1 ... A1 ... A1 ... AM) y B (B1 ... BN, b1 ... bm) en h (k, u, m, v, n), donde en ≠ bt, t∈ [1, s], at = bt, t> s. Salida: una ruta clave correcta desde el nodo A a B en H (K, U, M, V, N). Paso 1: Obtenga las cadenas de código del nodo A y B: A ← (A1 ... AN, A1 ... AM), B ← (B1 ... Bn, B1 ... BM), donde AJ, BJ [0, ∈ U-1],AJ, BJ [0, ∈ V-1]. Paso 2: si A1 ... AM = B1 ... BM, entonces el nodo A puede encontrar una ruta a B de acuerdo con los algoritmos de enrutamiento de Hypercube [9-10]. Paso 3: de lo contrario, el nodo A puede encontrar una ruta a C (B1 ... Bn, A1 ... AM) de acuerdo con el algoritmo I o el Algoritmo II. Entonces dejemos i0 = c (b1 ... bn, a1 ... am), i1 = (b1 ... bn, b1 a2 ... am), ..., es = b (b1 ... bn, b1 b2 ... bs como+1 ... am) y y yCada nodo en la serie de nodos anteriores encuentra una ruta a su nodo vecino IT+1 sobre la base de la información de ubicación (algoritmos de enrutamiento detallados basados en la información de ubicación puede ver las referencias [11-14]). Paso 4: Salidas de algoritmo. Si existe tal tipo de ruta de clave correcta, entonces a través del nodo A puede establecer una clave indirecta por pares con el nodo B. De lo contrario, el nodo A no puede establecer una clave indirecta por pares con el nodo B. Y el nodo A intenta nuevamente establecer una clave indirecta por pares con el nodo B en algún momento posterior.7. Análisis de algoritmo 7.1 Análisis prácticos De acuerdo con la descripción y los análisis anteriores, es fácil saber que el algoritmo recientemente propuesto anterior tiene las siguientes propiedades: Propiedad 3: Cuando no existe nodos de falla y comprometidos, mediante el uso de un nuevo esquema de predistribución clave de pares basado en la clave basadoH (K, U, M, V, N) Modelo, la probabilidad de un establecimiento clave directo por pares entre dos nodos puede estimarse como p = (m (u-1)+n (v-1))/(n-1), donde n es el número total de nodos en la red de sensores, y n = um * vn. Prueba: dado que las claves por pares predistribuido para cualquier nodo fa = {f iiil n 1, ... ,,, 32> <(i1, y), ..., f n iiil n> <−121, ... ,,, ((((en, y);f JJinii M 1, ... ,,, ..., 2,1 2> <(J1, Y), ..., F M JJinii M> <−11, ... ,,, ..., 2,1(JM, Y)} En el algoritmo recientemente propuesto. Obviamente, en el hipercubo lógico formado por los nodos en el mismo clúster del nodo A, hay nodos N (V-1), que 58 tienen una clave directa por pares con el nodo A. Y en el hipercubo lógico formado por los nodos en diferentes grupos del del nodo A, hay nodos M (U-1), que tienen una clave directa por pares con el nodo A. Por lo tanto, hay nodos totalmente m (U-1)+N (V-1), que tienen una clave directa por pares con el nodo A. Por lo tanto, la probabilidad de establecimiento clave por pares entre dos nodos se puede estimar como p = (m (u-1)+n (v-1))/(n-1), ya que toda la red de sensores tiene n nodos de sensor entodo. Figura 4 presenta la comparación entre la probabilidad del establecimiento de la clave por pares directo entre dos nodos y la dimensión N, cuando la red de sensores tiene nodos totales diferentes, y use el nuevo esquema de predistribución de la clave parescal basada en H (8,2,3,v, n) modelo.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01 Número de probabilidad de dimensionesn, cuando la red de sensores tiene diferentes nodos totales y usa el nuevo esquema de predistribución de la clave pares en el modelo H (8,2,3, v, n). De la Figura 4, es fácil saber que al usar un nuevo esquema de predistribución de clave pares en pares basado en el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N), la probabilidad de establecer directamente por pares en pares entre dos nodos disminuye con el aumento deLa escala de las redes de sensores, y además, la probabilidad de un establecimiento clave directo por pares entre dos nodos disminuye con el aumento de la dimensión N, cuando se fija la escala de la red de sensores. Teorema 4: Suponiendo que el total de sensores es N en la red de sensores, luego, cuando U ≥ V2, la probabilidad de establecer clave directa entre dos nodos, cuando se usa el esquema de distribución clave basado en el modelo H HyperCube H (V, P), es más pequeño que eso cuando se usa el esquema de distribución clave basado en el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N). Prueba: dado que U ≥ V, entonces podemos dejar U = VT, donde t ≥ 2. Dado que el número total de nodos en h (v, p) es vp = n, el número total de nodos en h (k, u, m, v, n) es um * vn = n. Sea p = x+n, entonces está um * vn = vx * vn ⇒ um = vx ⇒ x = tm. De la Propiedad 3, es fácil saber que la probabilidad de establecimiento clave directo por pares entre dos nodos se puede estimar como p = (m (u-1)+n (v-1))/(n-1). Según la descripción en [7], se sabe que la probabilidad de un establecimiento clave directo por pares entre dos nodos puede estimarse como p = p (v-1)/(n-1) = (x (v-1)+n (v-1))/(n-1). A continuación, demostraremos que M (U-1) ≥ X (V-1): M (U-1) = M (VT -1), X (V-1) = TM (V-1). Construya una función como f (t) = vt -1- t (v-1), donde t ≥ 2. Cuando t = 2, es obvio que hay f (t) = vt -2v+1 = (v-1) 2 ≥ 0 y f (t) = t vt-1-v+1 ≥ 2v- v+1= V+1> 0. Entonces, hay f (t) ≥ 0 ⇒ Vt -1 ≥ t (v-1) ⇒ m (vt -1) ≥ tm (v-1) ⇒ m (u1) ≥ x (v-1). Por lo tanto, la conclusión del teorema se encuentra. En cuanto a la conclusión del Teorema 4, damos un ejemplo para ilustrar. Suponiendo que el número total de nodos en la red de sensores es n = 214, y H (k, u, m, v, n) = h (16,4,2,2,10), h (v, p) = =H (10,14), entonces la probabilidad de establecer clave directa por pares entre dos nodos basados en el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N) es P = (M (U-1)+N (V1))/(N-1) = (2 (4-1) +10 (2-1))/(214 -1) = 16/(214 -1), pero la probabilidad de establecer la clave directa por pares entre dos nodosBasado en el modelo H (V, P) es P = P (V-1)/(N-1) = 14 (2-1)/(214 -1) = 14/(214 1). Suponiendo que el número total de nodos en la red de sensores es n, figura.5 ilustra la comparación entre la probabilidad de establecer directamente por pares en pares entre dos nodos basados en el modelo H (k, u, m, v, n) y el modelo y elProbabilidad de un establecimiento directo de clave por pares entre dos nodos basados en el modelo H (V, P), cuando U = 4 y V = 2.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 x 10 -3 Escala de probabilidad de trabajo de trabajoProbabilidad de un establecimiento clave directo por pares entre los modelos H (V, N) y H (K, U, M, V, N). De la figura 5, es fácil saber que el teorema 5 se encuentra. Teorema 5: Suponiendo que el total de sensores es N en la red de sensores, entonces el esquema de distribución de clave por pares basado en el Hypercube Model H (V, P), es solo un caso especial del esquema de distribución de clave por pares basado en la H (K, U, M, V, N) Modelo. Prueba: en cuanto al esquema de distribución de clave por pares basado en el modelo H (k, u, m, v, n), deje k = 1 (u = 1, m = 0), lo que significa que la red total de sensores incluye solo unagrupo. Entonces, obviamente, el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N) se degradará en el modelo H (V, N). Según los Anayses anteriores en este documento y la definición del esquema de distribución de clave por pares basado en el modelo H de Hypercube H (V, P) en [7], es fácil saber que se encuentra la conclusión del teorema.59 7.2 Análisis de seguridad Al usar el algoritmo de establecimiento clave de la clave por pares, basado en el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N), los intrusos pueden lanzar dos tipos de ataques: 1) Los atacantes pueden apuntar a la clave de pares entre dos sensores particularesnodo, para comprometer la clave por pares entre ellos, o evitar que establezcan la clave por pares.2) Los atacantes pueden atacar contra toda la red de sensores, en orden para disminuir la probabilidad del establecimiento clave por pares, o aumentar el costo del establecimiento clave por pares. Ataques contra un par de nodos sensores 1. Suponiendo que los intrusos quieran atacar dos nodos de sensores particulares U, V, donde U, V no son nodos comprometidos, pero los intrusos quieren comprometer la clave por pares entre ellos.1) Si U, V puede establecer una clave directa por pares, entonces la única forma de comprometer la clave es comprometer el polinomio bivariado común F (x, y) entre U, V. Dado que el grado del polinomio bivariado F (x, y) es t, por lo que los intrusos necesitan comprometer al menos nodos sensores T+1 que tienen una parte del polinomio bivariado F (x, y).2) Si U, V pueden establecer una clave pares indirecta a través de nodos intermedios, entonces los intrusos necesitan comprometer al menos un nodo intermedio o comprometer el polinomio bivariado común F (x, y) entre dos nodos intermedios vecinos. Pero incluso si los intrusos logran hacer eso, el nodo U y V aún pueden restablecer la clave indirecta por pares a través de nodos intermedios alternativos.2. Suponiendo que los intrusos quieran atacar dos nodos de sensores particulares U, V, donde U, V no son nodos comprometidos, pero los intrusos quieren evitar que establezcan la clave por pares. Luego, los intrusos necesitan comprometer todos los polinomios bivariados de M+n del nodo u o v. Dado que el grado del polinomio bivariado f (x, y) es t, por lo que para el polinomio bivariado, los intrusos deben comprometer al menos+1 nodos sensores que tienen una parte del polinomio bivariado dado. Por lo tanto, los intrusos deben comprometer los nodos sensores (M+N) (t+1) por completo para evitar que U, V establezca la clave por pares. Los ataques contra la red de sensores suponen que los atacantes conozcan la distribución de los polinomios sobre los nodos sensores, puede atacar sistemáticamente la red al comprometer los polinomios en F uno por uno para comprometer toda la red. Suponga que la fracción de los polinomios comprometidos es PC, luego hay hasta n = PC × {VN V N UMV N N MN × ×+×] [} = PC × elegante (M+N) Nodos de sensor que tienen al menosUna participación polinomial comprometida. Entre todos los nodos del sensor N-n restantes, ninguno de ellos incluye una participación polinomial comprometida. Por lo tanto, los nodos del sensor N-N restantes pueden establecer la clave directa por pares mediante el uso de cualquiera de sus acciones polinomiales. Sin embargo, las teclas indirectas por pares en los nodos del sensor N-N restantes pueden verse afectadas. Y pueden necesitar restablecer una nueva clave indirecta por pares entre ellos mediante nodos intermedios alternativos seleccionados que no pertenecen a los nodos comprometidos N. Suponiendo que la escala de la red de sensores es n = 10000, figura.6 Presenta la comparación entre PC y el número de nodos de sensores con al menos una participación polinomial comprometida en redes de sensores basadas en diferentes H (K, U, M, V,n) Modelos de distribución. De la Figura 6, es fácil saber que, cuando la escala de la red de sensores se fija, el número de nodos sensores afectados en la red de sensores aumenta con el aumento del número de nodos comprometidos.0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 F RACIÓN DE C OM PROM es ed B ivariate P Oly Nom iialsSensornodesWithatleastEndeCompromisedPolinomialShare H (1,0,100,2) H (2,2,1,1,1, 71,2) H (4,2,2,50,2) H (8,2,3,36,2) Figura.6 La comparación entre PC y el número de nodos sensores con al menos una participación polinomial comprometida enRedes de sensores basadas en diferentes modelos de distribución H (K, U, M, V, N). Teorema 6: Suponiendo que los sensores totales son n en la red de sensores, y la fracción de nodos comprometidos es PC, luego, cuando u> V, el número de nodos afectados del esquema de predistribución clave basado en el modelo H (V, P) esMás grande que el del esquema de predistribución clave basado en el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N). Prueba: Dado que el número de nodos afectados del esquema de predistribución clave basado en el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N) es PC × N (M+N), y se demuestra en [7] que el número deLos nodos afectados del esquema de predistribución clave basado en el modelo H (V, P) es PC × N P.Sea p = x+n, entonces está um * vn = vx * vn ⇒ um = vx.

De la Figura 7, es fácil saber que la conclusión del Teorema 9 es correcta, y el número de nodos sensores afectados en la red de sensores aumenta con el aumento del número de nodos comprometidos, cuando es la escala de la red de sensores.fijado.60 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.1 0.11 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 Fraction of Compromised Bivariate Polynomials SensorNodeswithatleastoneCompromisedPolynomialShare H(9,3,2,34,2) H(16,4,2,25, 2) H (225,15,2,7,2) H (1296,36,2,3,2) H (2,14) Figura.7 La comparación entre PC y el número de nodos sensores con al menos unoCompañería polinomial comprometida en redes de sensores basadas en modelos de distribución H (9,3,2,2,2, n) y H (2, P).8. Conclusión Se propone un nuevo modelo jerárquico de hipercubos llamado H (K, U, M, V, N), que puede usarse para la predistribución de la clave por pares para las redes de sensores implementadas por clúster. Y basado en el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N), un innovador esquema de predistribución de la clave por pares y el algoritmo se diseñan respectivamente, al peinar las buenas propiedades de los esquemas de cifrado de la clave polinomial y la piscina clave. El nuevo algoritmo utiliza las buenas características de los códigos de nodo y la alta tolerancia a fallas del modelo H (K, U, M, V, N) para enrutar y predistribuir las teclas por pares, en las que no son necesarios nodos para poder comunicarse entre sídirectamente tal como los algoritmos propuestos por [7] necesitarán. Por lo tanto, el algoritmo de predistribución de la clave de pares tradicional basado en el modelo de hipercubos [7] es solo un caso especial del nuevo algoritmo propuesto en este documento. Los análisis teóricos y experimentales muestran que el algoritmo recientemente propuesto es un algoritmo de establecimiento clave eficiente por pares que es adecuado para las redes de sensores implementadas por clúster.9.

        "A new kind of cluster deployed sensor networks distribution model is presented, and based on which, an innovative Hierarchical Hypercube model - H(k,u,m,v,n) and the mapping relationship between cluster deployed sensor networks and the H(k,u,m,v,n) are proposed.",
        "By utilizing nice properties of H(k,u,m,v,n) model, a new general framework for pairwise key predistribution and a new pairwise key establishment algorithm are designed, which combines the idea of KDC(Key Distribution Center) and polynomial pool schemes.",
        "Furthermore, the working performance of the newly proposed pairwise key establishment algorithm is seriously inspected.",
        "Theoretic analysis and experimental figures show that the new algorithm has better performance and provides higher possibilities for sensor to establish pairwise key, compared with previous related works.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication-Networks]: Distributed Systems-Distributed applications.",
        "General Terms: Security. 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Security communication is an important requirement in many sensor network applications, so shared secret keys are used between communicating nodes to encrypt data.",
        "As one of the most fundamental security services, pairwise key establishment enables the sensor nodes to communicate securely with each other using cryptographic techniques.",
        "However, due to the sensor nodes limited computational capabilities, battery energy, and available memory, it is not feasible for them to use traditional pairwise key establishment techniques such as public key cryptography and key distribution center (KDC).",
        "Several alternative approaches have been developed recently to perform pairwise key establishment on resource-constrained sensor networks without involving the use of traditional cryptography [14].",
        "Eschenauer and Gligor proposed a basic probabilistic key predistribution scheme for pairwise key establishment [1].",
        "In the scheme, each sensor node randomly picks a set of keys from a key pool before the deployment so that any two of the sensor nodes have a certain probability to share at least one common key.",
        "Chan et al. further extended this idea and presented two key predistribution schemes: a q-composite key pre-distribution scheme and a random pairwise keys scheme.",
        "The q-composite scheme requires any two sensors share at least q pre-distributed keys.",
        "The random scheme randomly picks pair of sensors and assigns each pair a unique random key [2].",
        "Inspired by the studies above and the polynomial-based key pre-distribution protocol [3], Liu et al. further developed the idea addressed in the previous works and proposed a general framework of polynomial pool-based key predistribution [4].",
        "The basic idea can be considered as the combination of the polynomial-based key pre-distribution and the key pool idea used in [1]] and [2].",
        "Based on such a framework, they presented two pairwise key pre-distribution schemes: a random subset assignment scheme and a grid-based scheme.",
        "A polynomial pool is used in those schemes, instead of using a key pool in the previous techniques.",
        "The random subset assignment scheme assigns each sensor node the secrets generated from a random subset of polynomials in the polynomial pool.",
        "The gridbased scheme associates polynomials with the rows and the columns of an artificial grid, assigns each sensor node to a unique coordinate in the grid, and gives the node the secrets generated from the corresponding row and column polynomials.",
        "Based on this grid, each sensor node can then identify whether it can directly establish a pairwise key with another node, and if not, what intermediate nodes it can contact to indirectly establish the pairwise key.",
        "A similar approach to those schemes described by Liu et al was independently developed by Du et a. [5].",
        "Rather than on Blundos scheme their approach is based on Bloms scheme [6].",
        "In some cases, it is essentially equivalent to the one in [4].",
        "All of those schemes above improve the security over the basic probabilistic key pre-distribution scheme.",
        "However, the pairwise key establishment problem in sensor networks is still not well solved.",
        "For the basic probabilistic and the q-composite key predistribution schemes, as the number of compromised nodes increases, the fraction of affected pairwise keys increases quickly.",
        "As a result, a small number of compromised nodes may affect a large fraction of pairwise keys [3].",
        "Though the random pairwise keys scheme doses not suffer from the above security problem, it incurs a high memory overhead, which increases linearly with the number of nodes in the network if the level of security is kept constant [2][4].",
        "For the random subset assignment scheme, it suffers higher communication and computation overheads.",
        "In 2004, Liu proposed a new hypercube-based pairwise key predistribution scheme [7], which extends the grid-based scheme from a two dimensional grid to a multi-dimensional hypercube.",
        "The analysis shows that hypercube-based scheme keeps some attractive properties of the grid-based scheme, including the guarantee of establishing pairwise keys and the resilience to node compromises.",
        "Also, when perfect security against node compromise is required, the hypercube-based scheme can support a larger network by adding more dimensions instead of increasing the storage overhead on sensor nodes.",
        "Though hypercube-based scheme (we consider the grid-based scheme is a special case of hypercube-based scheme) has many attractive properties, it requires any two nodes in sensor networks can communication directly with each other.",
        "This strong assumption is impractical in most of the actual applications of the sensor networks.",
        "In this paper, we present a kind of new cluster-based distribution model of sensor networks, and for which, we propose a new pairwise key pre-distribution scheme.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Combining the deployment knowledge of sensor networks and the polynomial pool-based key pre-distribution, we setup a clusterbased topology that is practical with the real deployment of sensor networks.",
        "Based on the topology, we propose a novel cluster distribution based hierarchical hypercube model to establish the pairwise key.",
        "The key contribution is that our scheme dose not require the assumption of all nodes can directly communicate with each other as the previous schemes do, and it still maintains high probability of key establishment, low memory overhead and good security performance.",
        "We develop a kind of new pairwise key establishment algorithm with our hierarchical hypercube model.",
        "The structure of this paper is arranged as follows: In section 3, a new distribution model of cluster deployed sensor networks is presented.",
        "In section 4, a new Hierarchical Hypercube model is proposed.",
        "In section 5, the mapping relationship between the clusters deployed sensor network and Hierarchical Hypercube model is discussed.",
        "In section 6 and section 7, new pairwise key establishment algorithm are designed based on the Hierarchical Hypercube model and detailed analyses are described.",
        "Finally, section 8 presents a conclusion. 2.",
        "PRELIMINARY Definition 1 (Key Predistribution): The procedure, which is used to encode the corresponding encryption and decryption algorithms in sensor nodes before distribution, is called Key Predistribution.",
        "Definition 2 (Pairwise Key): For any two nodes A and B, if they have a common key E, then the key E is called a pairwise key between them.",
        "Definition 3 (Key Path): For any two nodes A0 and Ak, when there has not a pairwise key between them, if there exists a path A0,A1,A2,……,Ak-1,Ak, and there exists at least one pairwise key between the nodes Ai and Aj for 0≤i≤k-1 and 1≤j≤k, then the path consisted of A0,A1,A2,……,Ak-1,Ak is called a Key Path between A0 and Ak.",
        "Definition 4 (n-dimensional Hypercube): An n-dimensional Hypercube (or n−cube) H(v,n) is a topology with the following properties: (1) It is consisted of n·vn-1 edges, (2) Each node can be coded as a string with n positions such as b1b2…bn, where 0≤b1,b2,…,bn≤v-1, (3) Any two nodes are called neighbors, which means that there is an edge between them, iff there is just one position different between their node codes. 3.",
        "MODEL OF CLUSTERS DEPLOYED SENSOR NETWORKS In some actual applications of sensor networks, sensors can be deployed through airplanes.",
        "Supposing that the deployment rounds of sensors are k, and the communication radius of any sensors is r, then the sensors deployed in the same round can be regarded as belonging to a same Cluster.",
        "We assign a unique cluster number l (1 ≤ l ≤ k) for each cluster.",
        "Supposing that the sensors form a connected graph in any cluster after deployment through airplanes, and then the Fig.1 presents an actual model of clusters deployed sensor networks.",
        "Figure.1 An actual model of clusters deployed sensor networks.",
        "From Figure.1, it is easy to know that, for a given node A, there exist lots of nodes in the same cluster of A, which can be communicated directly with A, since the nodes are deployed densely in a cluster.",
        "But there exist much less nodes in a cluster neighboring to the cluster of A, which can be communicated directly with A. since the two clusters are not deployed at the same time. 4.",
        "HIERARCHICAL HYPERCUBE MODEL Definition 5 (k-levels Hierarchical Hypercube): Let there are N nodes totally, then a k-levels Hierarchical Hypercube named H(k,u,m,v,n) can be constructed as follows: 1) The N nodes are divided into k clusters averagely, and the [N/k] nodes in any cluster are connected into an n-dimensional Hypercube: In the n-dimensional Hypercube, any node is encoded 55 as i1i2…in, which are called In-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes, where 0 ≤ i1,i2,…in ≤ v-1,v=[ n kN / ],[j] equals to an integer not less than j.",
        "So we can obtain k such kind of different hypercubes. 2) The k different hypercubes obtained above are encoded as j1j2…jm, which are called Out-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes, where 0 ≤ j1,j2,…jm ≤ u-1,u=[ m k ].",
        "And the nodes in the k different hypercubes are connected into m-dimensional hypercubes according to the following rules: The nodes with same In-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes and different Out-ClusterHypercube-Node-Codes are connected into an m-dimensional hypercube. (The graph constructed through above steps is called a k-levels Hierarchical Hypercube abbreviated as H(k,u,m,v,n).) 3) Any node A in H(k,u,m,v,n) can be encoded as (i, j), where i(i=i1i2…in, 0 ≤ i1,i2,…in ≤ v-1) is the In-Cluster-HypercubeNode-Code of node A, and j(j=j1j2…jm, 0 ≤ j1,j2,…jm ≤ u-1) is the Out-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Code of node A.",
        "Obviously, the H(k,u,m,v,n) model has the following good properties: Property 1: The diameter of H(k,u,m,v,n) model is m+n.",
        "Proof: Since the diameter of n-dimensional hypercube is n, and the diameter of m-dimensional hypercube is m, so it is easy to know that the diameter of H(k,u,m,v,n) model is m+n from the definition 5.",
        "Property 2: The distance between any two nodes A(i1, j1) and B(i2, j2) in H(k,u,m,v,n) model is d(A,B)= dh(i1, i2)+dh(j1, j2), where dh represents the Hamming distance.",
        "Proof: Since the distance between any two nodes in hypercube equals to the Hamming distance between them, so it is obvious that the theorem 2s conclusion stands from definition 5. 5.",
        "MAPPING CLUSTERS DEPLOYED SENSOR NETWORKS TO H(K,U,M,V,N) Obviously, from the description in section 3 and 4, we can know that the clusters deployed sensor network can be mapped into a klevels- hierarchical hypercube model as follows: At first, the k clusters in the sensor network can be mapped into k different levels (or hypercubes) in the k-levels- hierarchical hypercube model.",
        "Then, the sensor nodes in each cluster can be encoded with the In-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes, and the sensor nodes in the k different clusters with the same In-ClusterHypercube-Node-Codes can be encoded with the Out-ClusterHypercube-Node-Codes according to the definition 5 respectively.",
        "Consequently, the whole sensor network has been mapped into a k-levels- hierarchical hypercube model. 6.",
        "H(K,U,M,V,N) MODEL-BASED PAIRWISE KEY PREDISTRIBUTION ALGORITHM FOR SENSOR NETWORKS In order to overcome the drawbacks of polynomial-based and polynomial pool-based key predistribution algorithms, this paper proposed an innovative H(k,u,m,v,n) model-based key predistribution scheme and pairwise key establishment algorithm, which combines the advantages of polynomial-based and key pool-based encryption schemes, and is based on the KDC and polynomials pool-based key predistribution models.",
        "The new H(k,u,m,v,n) model-based pairwise key establishment algorithm includes three main steps: (1) Generation of the polynomials pool and key predistribution, (2) Direct pairwise key discovery, (3) Path key discovery. 6.1 Generation of Polynomials Pool and Key Predistribution Supposing that, the sensor network includes N nodes, and is deployed through k different rounds.",
        "Then we can predistribute keys for each sensor node on the basis of the H(k,u,m,v,n) model as follows: Step 1: Key setup server randomly generates a bivariate polynomials pool such as the following: F={ f i iiil n >< −121 ,...,,, (x,y), f j jjjinii m >< −121 ,...,,,,...,2,1 (x,y) | 0 ≤ iii n 121 ... −≤≤≤ ≤ v-1, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ k; 0 ≤ jjj m 121 ... −≤≤≤ ≤ u-1 , 1 ≤ j ≤ m} with vn *m*um-1 +[N/vn ]*n*vn-1 different t-degree bivariate polynomials over a finite field Fq, and then assigns a unique polynomial ID to each bivariate polynomial in F. Step 2: In each round, key setup server assigns a unique node ID: (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) to each sensor node from small to big, where 0 ≤ i1,i2,…in ≤ v-1, 0 ≤ j1,j2,…jm ≤ u-1.",
        "Step 3: key setup server assigns a unique cluster ID: l to all the sensor nodes deployed in the same round, where 1 ≤ l ≤ k. Step 4: key setup server predistributes m+n bivariate polynomials { f iiil n 1 ,...,,, 32 >< (i1,y),…, f n iiil n >< −121 ,...,,, (in,y); f jjinii m 1 ,...,,,...,2,1 2 >< ( j1,y),…, f m jjinii m >< −11 ,...,,,...,2,1 ( jm,y) } and the corresponding polynomial IDs to the sensor node deployed in the lth round and with ID (i1i2…in, j1j2…jm). 6.2 Direct Pairwise Key Discovery If the node A(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) in the sensor network wants to establish pairwise key with a node B (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), then node A can establish pairwise key with the node B trough the following methods.",
        "Firstly, node A computes out the distance between itself and node B: d= d1+ d2, where d1=dh(i1i2…in, i1i2…in) and d2=dh(j1j2…jm, j1j2…jm).",
        "If d=1, then node A obtains the direct pairwise key between itself and node B according to the following theorem 1: Theorem 1: For any two sensor nodes A(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) and B (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) in the sensor network, supposing that the 56 distance between nodes A and B is d= d1+ d2, where d1=dh(i1i2…in, i1i2…in) and d2=dh(j1j2…jm, j1j2…jm).",
        "If d=1, then there exists a direct pairwise key between nodes A and B. Poof: Since d=1, then there is d1=1, d2=0, or d1=0, d2=1. 1) If d1=1, d2=0: From d2=0, there is nodes A, B belong to the same cluster.",
        "Supposing that nodes A, B belong to the same cluster l, then from d1=1 ⇒ There is only one position different between i1i2…in and i1i2…in.",
        "Let it=it, when 1 ≤ t ≤ n-1, and in ≠ in ⇒ f n iiil n >< −121 ,...,,, (in,in)= f n iiil n >′′′< −121 ,...,,, (in,in).",
        "So, there exists a direct pairwise key f n iiil n >< −121 ,...,,, (in,in) between nodes A and B. 2) If d1=0, d2=1: From d2=1 ⇒ There is only one position different between j1j2…jm and j1j2…jm.",
        "Let jt=jt, when 1 ≤ t ≤ m1, and jm ≠ jm.",
        "Since d1=0 ⇒ i1i2…in equals to i1i2…in ⇒ f m jjjinii m >< −121 ,...,,,,...,2,1 (jm, jm)= f m jjji nii m >′′′′′′< −121 ,...,,,,...,2,1 (jm,jm).",
        "So, there exists a direct pairwise key f m jjjinii m >< −121 ,...,,,,...,2,1 (jm, jm) between nodes A and B.",
        "According to theorem 1, we present the detailed description of the direct pairwise key discovery algorithm as follows: Step 1: Obtain the node IDs and cluster IDs of the source node A and destination node B; Step 2: Compute out the distance between nodes A and B: d= d1+ d2; Step 3: If d1=1, d2=0, then select out a common polynomial share of nodes A and B from { f iiil n 1 ,...,,, 32 >< ,..., f n iiil n >< −121 ,...,,, } to establish direct pairwise key; Step 4: If d1=0, d2=1, then select out a common polynomial share of nodes A and B from { f jjinii m 1 ,...,,,...,2,1 2 >< ,..., f m jjjinii m >< −121 ,...,,,,...,2,1 } to establish direct pairwise key; Step 5: Otherwise, there exists no direct pairwise key between nodes A and B.",
        "And then turn to the following path key discovery process. 6.3 Path Key Discovery If d>1, then node A can establish path key with node B according to the following theorem 2: Theorem 2: For any two sensor nodes A(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) and B (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) in the sensor network, supposing that the distance between nodes A and B is d= d1+ d2, where d1=dh(i1i2…in, i1i2…in) and d2=dh(j1j2…jm, j1j2…jm).",
        "If d>1, then there exists a path key between nodes A and B.",
        "Proof: Let d1=a, d2=b, then we can think that it ≠ it, when 1 ≤ t ≤ a; but it=it, when t>a; and jt ≠ jt, when 1 ≤ t ≤ b; but jt=jt, when t>b.",
        "Obviously, nodes A(i1i2…in, j1j2…jm) ,(i1i2 i3…in, j1j2…jm),(i1i2 i3…in, j1j2…jm),…,(i1i2…in, j1j2…jm) belong to the same cluster.",
        "So, according to the supposing condition of The nodes in the same cluster form a connected graph, there is a route among those nodes.",
        "In addition, in those nodes, the distance between any two neighboring nodes is 1, so from theorem 1, it is easy to know that there exists direct pairwise key between any two neighboring nodes among those nodes.",
        "For nodes (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), (i1i2…in,j1 j2 j3…jm), (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm-1 jm),…, (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm-1jm), since they have the same Out-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes with the node B(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), so nodes (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), (i1i2…in,j1 j2 j3…jm), (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm-1 jm),…, (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm-1 jm) and node B belong to a same logical hypercube.",
        "Obviously, from the supposing condition of The whole sensor network forms a connected graph, there is a route among those nodes.",
        "In addition, in those nodes, the distance between any two neighboring nodes is 1, so from theorem 1, it is easy to know that there exists direct pairwise key between any two neighboring nodes among those nodes.",
        "So, it is obvious that there exists a path key between nodes A and B.",
        "According to theorem 2, we present the detailed description of the path key discovery algorithm as follows: Step 1: Compute out the intermediate nodes (i1i2 i3…in,j1j2…jm), (i1i2 i3…in,j1j2…jm),…,(i1i2…in, j1j2…jm) and (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm), (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm-1 jm),…,(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm-1 jm) from the source node A(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) and the destination node B (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm).",
        "Step 2: In those nodes series A(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), (i1i2 i3…in,j1j2…jm), (i1i2 i3…in,j1j2…jm),…,(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) and (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm), (i1i2…in,j1j2 j3…jm-1 jm),…, (i1i2…in, j1j2…jm-1 jm), B (i1i2…in,j1j2…jm), the neighboring nodes select their common polynomial share to establish direct pairwise key.",
        "From theorem 2, it is easy to know that any source node A can compute out a key path P to the destination node B according to the above algorithm, when there are no compromised nodes in the sensor network.",
        "Once the key path P is computed out, then node A can send messages to B along the path P to establish indirect pairwise key with node B. Fig.2 presents a example of key path establishment.",
        "Figure.2 Key path establishment example.",
        "For example: In the above Figure.2, node A((012),(1234)) can establish pairwise key with node B((121),(2334)) through the following key path: A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) → E((121),(1234)) → F((121),(2234)) → B((121),(2334)), where node F shall route through nodes G, H, I, J to establish direct pairwise key with node B. 57 According to the properties of H(k,u,m,v,n) model, we can prove that the following theorem by combing the proof of theorem 2: Theorem 3: Supposing that there exist no compromised nodes in the sensor network, and the distance between node A and B, then there exists a shortest key path with k distance between node A and B logically.",
        "That is to say, node A can establish indirect pairwise key with node B through t-1 intermediate nodes.",
        "Proof: Supposing that the distance between node A(i1i2…in, j1j2…jm) and B (i1i2…in, j1j2…jm) is d=d1+ d2, where d1=dh(i1i2…in, i1i2…in), d2=dh(j1j2…jm, j1j2…jm).",
        "Since d=t, according to the construction properties of H(k,u,m,v,n), it is easy to know that there exist t-1 intermediate nodes I1,…,It-1, in the logical space H(k,u,m,v,n), which satisfy that the distance between any two neighboring nodes in the nodes series A, I1,…,It1, B equals to 1.",
        "So according to the theorem 1, we can know that nodes A, I1,…,It-1, B form a correct key path between node A and B.",
        "If any two neighboring nodes in the nodes series A, I1,…,It-1, B can communicate directly, then node A can establish indirect pairwise key with node B through those t-1 intermediate nodes. 6.4 Dynamic Path Key Discovery The path key discovery algorithm proposed in the above section can establish a key path correctly, only when there exist no compromised nodes in the whole sensor network, since the key path is computed out beforehand.",
        "And the proposed algorithm cannot find an alternative key path when there exist some compromised nodes or some intermediate nodes not in the communication radius, even that there exists other alternative key paths in the sensor network.",
        "From the following example we can know that there are many parallel paths in the H(k,u,m,v,n) model for any two given source and destination nodes, since the H(k,u,m,v,n) model is high fault-tolerant[9,10] .",
        "Figure.3 Alternative key path establishment example.",
        "For example: Considering the key path establishment example given in the above section based on Figure.2: A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) → E((121),(1234)) → F((121),(2234)) → B((121),(2334)), supposing that node F((121),(2234)) has compromised, then from Figure.3, we can know that there exists another alternative key path as A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) →E((121),(1234)) → M((121),(1334)) → B((121),(2334)), which can be used to establish the indirect pairwise key between node A and B, where node E shall route through nodes D and K to establish direct pairwise key with node M, and node M shall route through nodes N, O, G, H, I, J to establish direct pairwise key with node B.",

        "Since the degree of the bivariate polynomial f(x,y) is t, so the intruders need to compromise at least t+1 sensor nodes that have a share of the bivariate polynomial f(x,y). 2) If u,v can establish indirect pairwise key through intermediate nodes, then the intruders need to compromise at least one intermediate node, or compromise the common bivariate polynomial f(x,y) between two neighboring intermediate nodes.",

                "Dado que el grado del polinomio bivariado F (x, y) es t, por lo que los intrusos necesitan comprometer al menos nodos sensores T+1 que tienen una parte del polinomio bivariado F (x, y).2) Si U, V pueden establecer una \"clave de pares\" indirecta a través de nodos intermedios, entonces los intrusos necesitan comprometer al menos un nodo intermedio o comprometer el polinomio bivariado común F (x, y) entre dos nodos intermedios vecinos.",
                "Pero incluso si los intrusos logran hacer eso, el nodo U y V aún pueden restablecer la \"clave de pares\" indirecta a través de nodos intermedios alternativos.2.",
                "Suponiendo que los intrusos quieran atacar dos nodos de sensores particulares U, V, donde U, V no son nodos comprometidos, pero los intrusos quieren evitar que establezcan la \"clave por pares\".",
                "Por lo tanto, los intrusos deben comprometer los nodos del sensor (M+N) (t+1) por completo para evitar que U, V establezcan la \"clave por pares\".",
                "Por lo tanto, los nodos del sensor N-N restantes pueden establecer una \"clave de pares\" directa mediante el uso de cualquiera de sus acciones polinomiales.",
                "Y pueden necesitar restablecer una nueva \"clave de pareja\" indirecta entre ellos mediante nodos intermedios alternativos seleccionados que no pertenecen a los nodos N comprometidos.",
                "Conclusión Se propone un nuevo modelo jerárquico de hipercubos llamado H (K, U, M, V, N), que puede usarse para la predistribución de \"clave por pares\" para redes de sensores implementadas por clúster.",
                "Y basado en el modelo H (K, U, M, V, N), un esquema de predistribución y algoritmo innovador de \"clave por pares\" se diseñan respectivamente, al peinar las buenas propiedades de los esquemas de cifrado de la clave polinomial y la clave.",
                "Por lo tanto, el algoritmo de predistribución tradicional de \"clave por pares\" basado en el modelo de hipercubos [7] es solo un caso especial del nuevo algoritmo propuesto en este documento.",
                "Los análisis teóricos y experimentales muestran que el algoritmo recientemente propuesto es un algoritmo de establecimiento eficiente de \"clave por pares\" que es adecuado para las redes de sensores implementadas por clúster.9.",
