Our available information is often limited to observations of the agents external behavior in the past and present. To understand these actions, we need to deduce the agents internal state, which includes not only rational elements (such as intentions and plans), but also emotive ones (such as fear). In addition, we often want to predict the agents future actions, which are constrained not only by these inward characteristics, but also by the dynamics of the agents interaction with its environment. BEE (Behavior Evolution and Extrapolation) uses a faster-than-real-time agentbased model of the environment to characterize agents internal state by evolution against observed behavior, and then predict their future behavior, taking into account the dynamics of their interaction with the environment.

Our observations are often limited to the agents external behavior, which can frequently be summarized numerically as a trajectory in space-time (perhaps punctuated by actions from a fairly limited vocabulary). However, this behavior is driven by the agents internal state, which (in the case of a human) may involve high-level psychological and cognitive concepts such as intentions and emotions. A central challenge in many application domains is reasoning from external observations of agent behavior to an estimate of their internal state. Such reasoning is motivated by a desire to predict the agents behavior. This problem has traditionally been addressed under the rubric of plan recognition or plan inference. Work to date focuses almost entirely on recognizing the rational state (as opposed to the emotional state) of a single agent (as opposed to an interacting community), and frequently takes advantage of explicit communications between agents (as in managing conversational protocols). Many realistic problems deviate from these conditions. Increasing the number of agents leads to a combinatorial explosion that can swamp conventional analysis. Environmental dynamics can frustrate agent intentions. The agents often are trying to hide their intentions (and even their presence), rather than intentionally sharing information. An agents emotional state may be at least as important as its rational state in determining its behavior. Domains that exhibit these constraints can often be characterized as adversarial, and include military combat, competitive business tactics, and multi-player computer games. BEE (Behavioral Evolution and Extrapolation) is a novel approach to recognizing the rational and emotional state of multiple interacting agents based solely on their behavior, without recourse to intentional communications from them. It is inspired by techniques used to predict the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems, in which a representation of the system is continually fit to its recent past behavior. For nonlinear dynamical systems, the representation is a closed-form mathematical equation. In BEE, it is a set of parameters governing the behavior of software agents representing the individuals being analyzed. The current version of BEE characterizes and predicts the behavior of agents representing soldiers engaged in urban combat [8]. Section 2 reviews relevant previous work. Section 3 describes the architecture of BEE. Section 4 reports results from experiments with the system. Section 5 concludes. Further details that cannot be included here for the sake of space are available in an on-line technical report [16]. 2. PREVIOUS WORK BEE bears comparison with previous research in AI (plan recognition), Hidden Markov Models, and nonlinear dynamics systems (trajectory prediction). 2.1 Plan Recognition in AI Agent theory commonly describes an agents cognitive state in terms of its beliefs, desires, and intentions (the so-called BDI model [5, 20]). An agents beliefs are propositions about the state of the world that it considers true, based on its perceptions. Its desires are propositions about the world that it would like to be true. Desires are not necessarily consistent with one another: an agent might desire both to be rich and not to work at the same time. An agents intentions, or goals, are a subset of its desires that it has selected, based on its beliefs, to guide its future actions. Unlike desires, goals must be consistent with one another (or at least believed to be consistent by the agent). An agents goals guide its actions. Thus one ought to be able to learn something about an agents goals by observing its past actions, and knowledge of the agents goals in turn enables conclusions about what the agent may do in the future. This process of reasoning from an agents actions to its goals is known as plan recognition or plan inference. This body of work (surveyed recently at [3]) is rich and varied. It covers both single-agent and multi-agent (e.g., robot soccer team) plans, intentional vs. non-intentional actions, speech vs. non-speech behavior, adversarial vs. cooperative intent, complete vs. incomplete world knowledge, and correct vs. faulty plans, among other dimensions. Plan recognition is seldom pursued for its own sake. It usually supports a higher-level function. For example, in humancomputer interfaces, recognizing a users plan can enable the system to provide more appropriate information and options for user action. In a tutoring system, inferring the students plan is a first step to identifying buggy plans and providing appropriate remediation. In many cases, the higher-level function is predicting likely future actions by the entity whose plan is being inferred. We focus on plan recognition in support of prediction. An agents plan is a necessary input to a prediction of its future behavior, but hardly a sufficient one. At least two other influences, one internal and one external, need to be taken into account. The external influence is the dynamics of the environment, which may include other agents. The dynamics of the real world impose significant constraints. The environment may interfere with the desires of the agent [4, 10]. Most interactions among agents, and between agents and the world, are nonlinear. When iterated, these can generate chaos (extreme sensitivity to initial conditions). A rational analysis of an agents goals may enable us to predict what it will attempt, but any nontrivial plan with several steps will depend sensitively at each step to the reaction of the environment, and our prediction must take this reaction into account as well. Actual simulation of futures is one way (the only one we know now) to deal with the impact of environmental dynamics on an agents actions. Human agents are also subject to an internal influence. The agents emotional state can modulate its decision process and its focus of attention (and thus its perception of the environment). In extreme cases, emotion can lead an agent to choose actions that from the standpoint of a logical analysis may appear irrational. Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases. BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]). In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs). BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs. First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property. That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents. One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive. BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them. Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary. This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations. BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time. The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space. One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd . When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly. Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible. However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future. A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]). This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead. This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations. BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors, which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm. 3. ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation. Key elements of the BEE architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute. 3.1 Agent Model The agents in BEE are inspired by two bodies of work: our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through digital pheromones in a shared environment [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previous agentbased combat modeling. Digital pheromones are scalar variables that agents deposit and sense at their current location a c b d a c b d Figure 1: Tracking a nonlinear dynamical system. a = system state space; b = system trajectory over time; c = recent measurements of system state; d = short-range prediction. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1427 in the environment. Agents respond to local concentrations of these variables tropistically, climbing or descending local gradients. Their movements change the deposit patterns. This feedback loop, together with processes of evaporation and propagation in the environment, support complex patterns of interaction and coordination among the agents [15]. Table 1 shows the BEEs current pheromone flavors. For example, a living member of the adversary emits a RED-ALIVE pheromone, while roads emit a MOBILITY pheromone. Our soldier agents are inspired by EINSTein and MANA. EINSTein [6] represents an agent as a set of six weights, each in [-1, 1], describing the agents response to six kinds of information. Four of these describe the number of alive friendly, alive enemy, injured friendly, and injured enemy troops within the agents sensor range. The other two weights relate to the agents distance to its own flag and that of the adversary, representing objectives that it seeks to protect and attack, respectively. A positive weight indicates attraction to the entity described by the weight, while a negative weight indicates repulsion. MANA [9] extends the concepts in EINSTein. Friendly and enemy flags are replaced by the waypoints pursued by each side. MANA includes low, medium, and high threat enemies. In addition, it defines a set of triggers (e.g., reaching a waypoint, being shot at, making contact with the enemy, being injured) that shift the agent from one personality vector to another. A default state defines the personality vector when no trigger state is active. The personality vectors in MANA and EINSTein reflect both rational and emotive aspects of decision-making. The notion of being attracted or repelled by friendly or adversarial forces in various states of health is an important component of what we informally think of as emotion (e.g., fear, compassion, aggression), and the use of the term personality in both EINSTein and MANA suggests that the system designers are thinking anthropomorphically, though they do not use emotion to describe the effect they are trying to achieve. The notion of waypoints to which an agent is attracted reflects goal-oriented rationality. BEE uses an integrated rational-emotive personality model. A BEE agents rationality is a vector of seven desires, which are values in [-1, +1]: ProtectRed (the adversary), ProtectBlue (friendly forces), ProtectGreen (civilians), ProtectKeySites, AvoidCombat, AvoidDetection, and Survive. Negative values reverse the sense suggested by the label. For example, a negative value of ProtectRed indicates a desire to harm Red, and an agent with a high positive desire to ProtectRed will be attracted to REDALIVE, RED-CASUALTY, and MOBILITY pheromone, and will move at maximum speed. The emotive component of a BEEs personality is based on the Ortony-Clore-Collins (OCC) framework [11], and is described in detail elsewhere [12]. OCC define emotions as valanced reactions to agents, states, or events in the environment. This notion of reaction is captured in MANAs trigger states. An important advance in BEEs emotional model is the recognition that agents may differ in how sensitive they are to triggers. For example, threatening situations tend to stimulate the emotion of fear, but a given level of threat will produce more fear in a new recruit than in a seasoned veteran. Thus our model includes not only Emotions, but Dispositions. Each Emotion has a corresponding Disposition. Dispositions are relatively stable, and considered constant over the time horizon of a run of the BEE, while Emotions vary based on the agents disposition and the stimuli to which it is exposed. Interviews with military domain experts identified the two most crucial emotions for combat behavior as Anger (with the corresponding disposition Irritability) and Fear (whose disposition is Cowardice). Table 2 shows which pheromones trigger which emotions. For example, RED-CASUALTY pheromone stimulates both Anger and Fear in a Red agent, but not in a Blue agent. Emotions are modeled as agent hormones (internal pheromones) that are augmented in the presence of the triggering environmental condition and evaporate over time. A non-zero emotion modifies the agents actions. Elevated level Anger increases movement likelihood, weapon firing likelihood, and tendency toward an exposed posture. Elevated Fear decreases these likelihoods. Figure 2 summarizes the BEEs personality model. The left side is a straightforward BDI model (we prefer the term goal to intention). The right side is the emotive component, where an appraisal of the agents beliefs, moderated by the disposition, leads to an emotion that in turn influences the BDI analysis. Table 1.

Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 3.2 The BEE Cycle BEEs major innovation is extending the nonlinear systems technique of Section 2.2 to agent behaviors. This section describes this process at a high level, then details the multi-page pheromone infrastructure that implements it. 3.2.1 Overview Figure 3 is an overview of Behavior Evolution and Extrapolation. Each active entity in the battlespace has an persistent avatar that continuously generates a stream of ghost agents representing itself. We call the combined modeling entity consisting of avatar and ghosts a polyagent [14]. Ghosts live on a timeline indexed by that begins in the past and runs into the future. is offset with respect to the current time t. The timeline is divided into discrete pages, each representing a successive value of . The avatar inserts the ghosts at the insertion horizon. In our current system, the insertion horizon is at - t = -30, meaning that ghosts are inserted into a page representing the state of the world 30 minutes ago. At the insertion horizon, each ghosts behavioral parameters (desires and dispositions) are sampled from distributions to explore alternative personalities of the entity it represents. Each page between the insertion horizon and = t (now) records the historical state of the world at the point in the past to which it corresponds. As ghosts move from page to page, they interact with this past state, based on their behavioral parameters. These interactions mean that their fitness depends not just on their own actions, but also on the behaviors of the rest of the population, which is also evolving. Because advances faster than real time, eventually = t (actual time). At this point, each ghost is evaluated based on its location compared with the actual location of its corresponding real-world entity. The fittest ghosts have three functions. 1. The personality of each entitys fittest ghost is reported to the rest of the system as the likely personality of that entity. This information enables us to characterize individual warriors as unusually cowardly or brave. 2. The fittest ghosts breed genetically and their offspring return to the insertion horizon to continue the fitting process. 3. The fittest ghosts for each entity form the basis for a population of ghosts that run past the avatars present into the future. Each ghost that runs into the future explores a different possible future of the battle, analogous to how some people plan ahead by mentally simulating different ways that a situation might unfold. Analysis of the behaviors of these different possible futures yields predictions. Thus BEE has three distinct notions of time, all of which may be distinct from real-world time. 1. Domain time t is the current time in the domain being modeled. If BEE is applied to a real-world situation, this time is the same as real-world time. In our experiments, we apply BEE to a simulated battle, and domain time is the time stamp published by the simulator. During actual runs, the simulator is often paused, so domain time runs slower than real time. When we replay logs from simulation runs, we can speed them up so that domain time runs faster than real time. 2. BEE time for a page records the domain time corresponding to the state of the world represented on that page, and is offset from the current domain time. 3. Shift time is incremented every time the ghosts move from one page to the next. The relation between shift time and real time depends on the processing resources available. 3.2.2 Pheromone Infrastructure BEE must operate very rapidly, to keep pace with the ongoing battle. Thus we use simple agents coordinated using pheromone mechanisms. We have described the basic dynamics of our pheromone infrastructure elsewhere [2]. This infrastructure runs on the nodes of a graph-structured environment (in the case of BEE, a rectangular lattice). Each node maintains a scalar value for each flavor of pheromone, and provides three functions: It aggregates deposits from individual agents, fusing information across multiple agents and through time. It evaporates pheromones over time, providing an innovative alternative to traditional truth maintenance. Traditionally, knowledge bases remember everything they are told unless they have a reason to forget. Pheromone-based systems immediately begin to forget everything they learn, unless it is continually reinforced. Thus inconsistencies automatically remove themselves within a known period. It diffuses pheromones to nearby places, disseminating information for access by nearby agents. The distribution of each pheromone flavor over the environment forms a field that represents some aspect of the state of the world at an instant in time. Each page of the timeline is a complete pheromone field for the world at the BEE time represented by that page. The behavior of the pheromones on each page depends on whether the page represents the past or the future.

Each avatar generates a stream of ghosts that sample the personality space of its entity. They evolve against the entitys recent observed behavior, and the fittest ghosts run into the future to generate predictions. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1429 In pages representing the future ( > t), the usual pheromone mechanisms apply. Ghosts deposit pheromone each time they move to a new page, and pheromones evaporate and propagate from one page to the next. In pages representing the past ( t), we have an observed state of the real world. This has two consequences for pheromone management. First, we can generate the pheromone fields directly from the observed locations of individual entities, so there is no need for the ghosts to make deposits. Second, we can adjust the pheromone intensities based on the changed locations of entities from page to page, so we do not need to evaporate or propagate the pheromones. Both of these simplifications reflect the fact that in our current system, we have complete knowledge of the past. When we introduce noise and uncertainty, we will probably need to introduce dynamic pheromones in the past as well as the future. Execution of the pheromone infrastructure proceeds on two time scales, running in separate threads. The first thread updates the book of pages each time the domain time advances past the next page boundary. At each step, The former now + 1page is replaced with a new current page, whose pheromones correspond to the locations and strengths of observed units; An empty page is added at the prediction horizon; The oldest page is discarded, since it has passed the insertion horizon. The second thread moves the ghosts from one page to the next, as fast as the processor allows. At each step, Ghosts reaching the = t page are evaluated for fitness and removed or evolved; New ghosts from the avatars and from the evolutionary process are inserted at the insertion horizon; A population of ghosts based on the fittest ghosts are inserted at = t to run into the future; Ghosts that have moved beyond the prediction horizon are removed; All ghosts plan their next actions based on the pheromone field in the pages they currently occupy; The system computes the next state of each page, including executing the actions elected by the ghosts, and (in future pages) evaporating pheromones and recording new deposits from the recently arrived ghosts. Ghost movement based on pheromone gradients is a simple process, so this system can support realistic agent populations without excessive computer load. In our current system, each avatar generates eight ghosts per shift. Since there are about 50 entities in the battlespace (about 20 units each of Red and Blue and about 5 of Green), we must support about 400 ghosts per page, or about 24000 over the entire book. How fast a processor do we need? Let p be the real-time duration of a page in seconds. If each page represents 60 seconds of domain time, and we are replaying a simulation at 2x domain time, p = 30. Let n be the number of pages between the insertion horizon and = t. In our current system, n = 30. Then a shift rate of n/p shifts per second will permit ghosts to run from the insertion horizon to the current time at least once before a new page is generated. Empirically, this level is a lower bound for reasonable performance, and easily achievable on stock WinTel platforms. 3.3 Information sources The flexibility of the BEEs pheromone infrastructure permits the integration of numerous information sources as input to our characterizations of entity personalities and predictions of their future behavior. Our current system draws on three sources of information, but others can readily be added. Real-world observations.-Observations from the real world are encoded into the pheromone field each increment of BEE time, as a new current page is generated. Table 1 identifies the entities that generate each flavor of pheromone. Statistical estimates of threat regions.-Statistical techniques1 estimate the level of threat to each force (Red or Blue), based on the topology of the battlefield and the known disposition of forces. For example, a broad open area with no cover is threatening, especially if the opposite force occupies its margins. The results of this process are posted to the pheromone pages as RedThreat pheromone (representing a threat to red) and BlueThreat pheromone (representing a threat to Blue). AI-based plan recognition.-While plan recognition is not sufficient for effective prediction, it is a valuable input. We dynamically configure a Bayes net based on heuristics to identify the likely goals that each entity may hold.2 The destinations of these goals function as virtual pheromones. Ghosts include their distance to such points in their action decisions, achieving the result of gradient following without the computational expense of maintaining a pheromone field. 4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We have tested BEE in a series of experiments in which human wargamers make decisions that are played out in a battlefield simulator. The commander for each side (Red and Blue) has at his disposal a team of pucksters, human operators who set waypoints for individual units in the simulator. Each puckster is responsible for four to six units. The simulator moves the units, determines firing actions, and resolves the outcome of conflicts. It is important to emphasize that this simulator is simply a surrogate for a sensor feed from a real-world battlefield 4.1 Fitting Dispositions To test our ability to fit personalities based on behavior, one Red puckster responsible for four units is designated the emotional puckster. He selects two of his units to be cowardly (chickens) and two to be irritable (Rambos). He does not disclose this assignment during the run. He moves each unit according to the commanders orders until the unit encounters circumstances that would trigger the emotion associated with the units disposition. Then he manipulates chickens as though they are fearful (avoiding combat and moving away from Blue), and moves Rambos into combat as quickly as possible. Our software receives position reports on all units, every twenty seconds. 1 This process, known as SAD (Statistical Anomaly Detection), is developed by our colleagues Rafael Alonso, Hua Li, and John Asmuth at Sarnoff Corporation. Alonso and Li are now at SET Corporation. 2 This process, known as KIP (Knowledge-based Intention Projection), is developed by our colleagues Paul Nielsen, Jacob Crossman, and Rich Frederiksen at Soar Technology. 1430 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The difference between the two disposition values (Irritability - Cowardice) of the fittest ghosts proves a better indicator of the emotional state of the corresponding entity than either value by itself. Figure 4 shows the delta disposition for each of the eight fittest ghosts at each time step, plotted against the time in seconds, for a unit played as a chicken. The values clearly trend negative. Figure 5 shows a similar plot for a Rambo. Rambos tend to die early, and often do not give their ghosts enough time to evolve a clear picture of their personality, but in this case the positive Delta Disposition is evident before the units demise. To characterize a units personality, we maintain a 800-second exponentially weighted moving average of the Delta Disposition, and declare the unit to be a chicken or Rambo if this value passes a negative or positive threshold, respectively. Currently, this threshold is set at 0.25. We are exploring additional filters. For example, a rapid rate of increase enhances the likelihood of calling a Rambo; units that seek to avoid detection and avoid combat are more readily called chicken. Table 1 shows the detection results for emotional units in a recent series of experiments. We never called a Rambo a chicken. In the one case where we called a chicken a Rambo, logs show that in fact the unit was being played aggressively, rushing toward oncoming Blue forces. The brave die young, so we almost never detect units played intentionally as Rambos. Figure 6 shows a comparison on a separate series of experiments of our emotion detector compared with humans. Two cowards were played in each of eleven games. Human observers in each game were able to detect a total of 13 of the cowards. BEE was able to detect cowards (= chickens) much earlier than the human, while missing only one chicken that the humans detected. In addition to these results on units intentionally played as emotional, BEE sometimes detects other units as cowardly or brave. Analysis of these units shows that these characterizations were appropriate: units that flee in the face of enemy forces or weapons fire are detected as chickens, while those that stand their ground or rush the adversary are denominated as Rambos. 4.2 Integrated Predictions Each ghost that runs into the future generates a possible path that its unit might follow. The paths in the resulting set over all ghosts vary in how likely they are, the risk they pose to their own or the opposite side, and so forth. In the experiments reported here, we select the future whose ghost receives the most guidance from pheromones in the environment at each step along the way. In this sense, it is the most likely future. In these experiments, we receive position reports only on units that have actually come within visual range of Blue units, or on average fewer than half of the live Red units at any time. We evaluate predictions spatially, comparing an entitys actual location with the location predicted for it 15 minutes earlier. We compare BEE with two baselines: a gametheoretic predictor based on linguistic geometry [22], and estimates by military officers. In both cases, we use a CEP (circular error probable) measure of accuracy, the radius of the circle that one would have to draw around each prediction to capture 50% of the actual unit locations. The higher the CEP measure, the worse the accuracy. Figure 7 compares our accuracy with that of the gametheoretic predictor. Each point gives the median CEP measure over all predictions in a single run. Points above the diagonal favor BEE, while points below the line favor the game-theoretic predictor. In all but two missions, BEE is more accurate. In one mission, the two systems are comparable, while in one, the gameTable 1: Experimental Results on Fitting Disposition (16 runs) Called Correctly Called Incorrectly Not Called Chickens 68% 5% 27% Rambos 5% 0% 95% Figure 4: Delta Disposition for a Chickens Ghosts.

In 18 RAID runs, BEE generated 1405 predictions at each of two time horizons (0 and 15 minutes), while in 18 non-RAID runs, staff generated 102 predictions. Figure. 8 shows a box-andwhisker plot of the CEP measures, in meters, of these predictions. The box covers the inter-quartile range with a line at the median, whiskers extend to the most distant data points within 1.5 of the interquartile range from the edge of the box, squares show outliers within 3 interquartile ranges, and stars show more distant outliers. BEEs median score even at 15 minutes is lower than either Staff median. The Wilcoxon test shows that the difference between the H15 scores is significant at the 99.76% level, while that between the H0 scores is significant at more than 99.999%. 5. CONCLUSIONS In many domains, it is important to reason from an entitys observed behavior to an estimate of its internal state, and then to extrapolate that estimate to predict the entitys future behavior. BEE performs this task using a faster-than-real-time simulation of swarming agents, coordinated through digital pheromones. This simulation integrates knowledge of threat regions, a cognitive analysis of the agents beliefs, desires, and intentions, a model of the agents emotional disposition and state, and the dynamics of interactions with the environment. By evolving agents in this rich environment, we can fit their internal state to their observed behavior. In realistic wargames, the system successfully detects deliberately played emotions and makes reasonable predictions about the entities future behaviors. BEE can only model internal state variables that impact the agents external behavior. It cannot fit variables that the agent does not manifest externally, since the basis for the evolutionary cycle is a comparison of the outward behavior of the simulated agent with that of the real entity. This limitation is serious if our purpose is to understand the entitys internal state for its own sake. If our purpose of fitting agents is to predict their subsequent behavior, the limitation is much less serious. State variables that do not impact behavior, while invisible to a behavior-based analysis, are irrelevant to a behavioral prediction. The BEE architecture lends itself to extension in several promising directions. The various inputs being integrated by the BEE are only an example of the kinds of information that can be handled. The basic principle of using a dynamical simulation to integrate a wide range of influences can be extended to other inputs as well, requiring much less additional engineering than other more traditional ways of reasoning about how different knowledge sources come together in impacting an agents behavior. With such a change in inputs, BEE could be applied more widely than its current domain of adversarial reasoning in urban warfare. Potential applications of interest include computer games, business strategy, and sensor fusion. Our initial limited repertoire of emotions is a small subset of those that have been distinguished by psychologists, and that might be useful for understanding and projecting behavior. We expect to extend the set of emotions and supporting dispositions that BEE can detect. The mapping between an agents psychological (cognitive and emotional) state and its outward behavior is not one-to-one. Several different internal states might be consistent with a given observed behavior under one set of environmental conditions, but might yield distinct behaviors under other conditions. If the environment in the recent past is one that confounds such distinct internal states, we will be unable to distinguish them. As long as the environment stays in this state, our predictions will be accurate, whichever of the internal states we assign to the agent. If the environment then shifts to one under which the different internal states lead to different behaviors, using the previously chosen internal state will yield inaccurate predictions. One way to address these concerns is to probe the real world, perturbing it in ways that would stimulate distinct behaviors from entities whose psychological state is otherwise indistinguishable. Such probing is an important intelligence technique. BEEs faster-than-real-time simulation may enable us to identify appropriate probing actions, greatly increasing the effectiveness of intelligence efforts. 6.

Nuestra información disponible a menudo se limita a las observaciones del comportamiento externo de los agentes en el pasado y el presente. Para comprender estas acciones, necesitamos deducir el estado interno de los agentes, que incluye no solo elementos racionales (como intenciones y planes), sino también emotivos (como el miedo). Además, a menudo queremos predecir las acciones futuras de los agentes, que están limitadas no solo por estas características internas, sino también por la dinámica de la interacción de los agentes con su entorno. La abeja (evolución del comportamiento y extrapolación) utiliza un modelo del entorno basado en el entorno basado en el agente más rápido que el tiempo real para caracterizar el estado interno de los agentes por evolución contra el comportamiento observado, y luego predecir su comportamiento futuro, teniendo en cuenta la dinámica de su interacción con el medio ambiente.

I.2.11 [Inteligencia artificial]: inteligencia artificial distribuida: sistemas multiagentes. Algoritmos de términos generales, medición, experimentación.1. Introducción El razonamiento sobre los agentes que observamos en el mundo debe integrar dos niveles dispares. Nuestras observaciones a menudo se limitan al comportamiento externo de los agentes, que con frecuencia se pueden resumir numéricamente como una trayectoria en el espacio-tiempo (quizás puntuado por acciones de un vocabulario bastante limitado). Sin embargo, este comportamiento es impulsado por el estado interno de los agentes, que (en el caso de un humano) puede involucrar conceptos psicológicos y cognitivos de alto nivel, como intenciones y emociones. Un desafío central en muchos dominios de aplicación es el razonamiento de las observaciones externas del comportamiento del agente hasta una estimación de su estado interno. Tal razonamiento está motivado por el deseo de predecir el comportamiento de los agentes. Este problema se ha abordado tradicionalmente bajo la rúbrica de reconocimiento del plan o inferencia del plan. El trabajo hasta la fecha se centra casi por completo en reconocer el estado racional (a diferencia del estado emocional) de un solo agente (a diferencia de una comunidad interactiva), y con frecuencia aprovecha las comunicaciones explícitas entre los agentes (como en la gestión de protocolos de conversación). Muchos problemas realistas se desvían de estas condiciones. El aumento del número de agentes conduce a una explosión combinatoria que puede inundar el análisis convencional. La dinámica ambiental puede frustrar las intenciones de los agentes. Los agentes a menudo están tratando de ocultar sus intenciones (e incluso su presencia), en lugar de compartir información intencionalmente. Un estado emocional de los agentes puede ser al menos tan importante como su estado racional para determinar su comportamiento. Los dominios que exhiben estas limitaciones a menudo se pueden caracterizar como adversario e incluyen combate militar, tácticas comerciales competitivas y juegos de computadora múltiples. Bee (evolución del comportamiento y extrapolación) es un enfoque novedoso para reconocer el estado racional y emocional de los agentes interactivos múltiples basados únicamente en su comportamiento, sin recurrir a las comunicaciones intencionales de ellos. Está inspirado en las técnicas utilizadas para predecir el comportamiento de los sistemas dinámicos no lineales, en el que una representación del sistema se ajusta continuamente a su comportamiento pasado reciente. Para los sistemas dinámicos no lineales, la representación es una ecuación matemática de forma cerrada. En Bee, es un conjunto de parámetros que rigen el comportamiento de los agentes de software que representan a los individuos que se analizan. La versión actual de Bee caracteriza y predice el comportamiento de los agentes que representan a los soldados involucrados en el combate urbano [8]. La Sección 2 revisa el trabajo previo relevante. La Sección 3 describe la arquitectura de la abeja. La Sección 4 informa los resultados de los experimentos con el sistema. La Sección 5 concluye. Más detalles que no se pueden incluir aquí en aras del espacio están disponibles en un informe técnico en línea [16].2. El trabajo previo de la abeja comparan con investigaciones previas en IA (reconocimiento del plan), modelos ocultos de Markov y sistemas de dinámica no lineal (predicción de trayectoria).2.1 El reconocimiento del plan en la teoría del agente de IA describe comúnmente un estado cognitivo de los agentes en términos de sus creencias, deseos e intenciones (el llamado modelo BDI [5, 20]). Las creencias de los agentes son propuestas sobre el estado del mundo que considera verdadero, en función de sus percepciones. Sus deseos son propuestas sobre el mundo de que le gustaría ser verdad. Los deseos no son necesariamente consistentes entre sí: un agente podría desear ser ricos y no trabajar al mismo tiempo. Las intenciones u objetivos de los agentes son un subconjunto de sus deseos que ha seleccionado, en función de sus creencias, para guiar sus acciones futuras. A diferencia de los deseos, los objetivos deben ser consistentes entre sí (o al menos creen que el agente es consistente). Los objetivos de los agentes guían sus acciones. Por lo tanto, uno debe poder aprender algo sobre los objetivos de un agente observando sus acciones pasadas, y el conocimiento de los objetivos de los agentes a su vez permite conclusiones sobre lo que el agente puede hacer en el futuro. Este proceso de razonamiento de las acciones de un agente a sus objetivos se conoce como reconocimiento del plan o inferencia del plan. Este cuerpo de trabajo (encuestado recientemente en [3]) es rico y variado. Cubre planes de agente único y de agente múltiple (por ejemplo, equipo de fútbol de robot), acciones intencionales versus no intencionales, comportamiento del habla frente a la no voz, intención adversa versus cooperativa, conocimiento mundial completo versus incompleto y corregir el conocimiento mundial y corregir el conocimiento incompleto y corregirvs. planes defectuosos, entre otras dimensiones. El reconocimiento del plan rara vez se persigue por su propio bien. Por lo general, admite una función de nivel superior. Por ejemplo, en las interfaces de Humancomputer, reconocer un plan de usuarios puede permitir que el sistema proporcione información y opciones más apropiadas para la acción del usuario. En un sistema de tutoría, inferir el plan de los estudiantes es un primer paso para identificar los planes de errores y proporcionar la remediación adecuada. En muchos casos, la función de nivel superior predice las posibles acciones futuras de la entidad cuyo plan se infiere. Nos centramos en el reconocimiento del plan en apoyo de la predicción. Un plan de agentes es un aporte necesario para una predicción de su comportamiento futuro, pero apenas es suficiente. Al menos otras dos influencias, una interna y una externas, deben tenerse en cuenta. La influencia externa es la dinámica del entorno, que puede incluir otros agentes. La dinámica del mundo real impone restricciones significativas. El entorno puede interferir con los deseos del agente [4, 10]. La mayoría de las interacciones entre los agentes, y entre los agentes y el mundo, no son lineales. Cuando se iteran, estos pueden generar caos (sensibilidad extrema a las condiciones iniciales). Un análisis racional de los objetivos de un agente puede permitirnos predecir lo que intentará, pero cualquier plan no trivial con varios pasos dependerá sensiblemente en cada paso a la reacción del entorno, y nuestra predicción también debe tener en cuenta esta reacción. La simulación real de futuros es una forma (la única que conocemos ahora) para lidiar con el impacto de la dinámica ambiental en las acciones de los agentes. Los agentes humanos también están sujetos a una influencia interna. El estado emocional de los agentes puede modular su proceso de decisión y su enfoque de atención (y, por lo tanto, su percepción del medio ambiente). En casos extremos, la emoción puede llevar a un agente a elegir acciones que desde el punto de vista de un análisis lógico puedan parecer irracionales. El trabajo actual sobre el reconocimiento del plan para la predicción se centra en el plan racional, y no tiene en cuenta ni influencias ambientales externas ni sesgos emocionales internos. Bee integra los tres elementos en sus predicciones.2.2 Modelos Markov ocultos La abeja es superficialmente similar a los modelos de Markov ocultos (HMMS [19]). En ambos casos, el agente tiene un estado interno oculto (la personalidad de los agentes) y el estado observable (su comportamiento externo), y deseamos aprender el estado oculto del estado observable (por evolución en la abeja, por el algoritmo de Baum-Welch [1] en HMMS) y luego predice el comportamiento futuro de los agentes (por extrapolación a través de fantasmas en BEE, por el algoritmo delantero en HMMS). Bee ofrece dos beneficios importantes sobre HMMS. Primero, las variables ocultas de un solo agente no satisfacen la propiedad de Markov. Es decir, sus valores en T + 1 dependen no solo de sus valores en T, sino también de las variables ocultas de otros agentes. Uno podría evitar esta limitación construyendo un solo HMM sobre el espacio de estado conjunto de todos los agentes, pero este enfoque es combinatoriamente prohibitivo. Bee combina la eficiencia de modelar independientemente a los agentes individuales con la realidad de tener en cuenta las interacciones entre ellos. En segundo lugar, los modelos de Markov suponen que las probabilidades de transición son estacionarias. Esta suposición no es realista en situaciones dinámicas. El proceso evolutivo de las abejas actualiza continuamente las personalidades de los agentes en función de las observaciones reales y, por lo tanto, explica automáticamente los cambios en las personalidades de los agentes.2.3 Los sistemas no lineales en tiempo real que se ajustan a muchos sistemas de interés pueden describirse mediante un vector de números reales que cambia en función del tiempo. Las dimensiones del vector definen el espacio de estado de los sistemas. Típicamente se analiza los sistemas como ecuaciones diferenciales vectoriales, por ejemplo,) (XF DT XD. Cuando F es no lineal, el sistema puede ser formalmente caótico, y los puntos de partida sean arbitrariamente cerca uno del otro pueden conducir a trayectorias que divergen exponencialmente rápidamente. La predicción de largo alcance de dicho sistema es imposible. Sin embargo, a menudo es útil anticipar el comportamiento de los sistemas a corta distancia en el futuro. Una técnica común es ajustar una forma funcional conveniente para F a la trayectoria de los sistemas en el pasado reciente, luego extrapolar este ajuste en el futuro (Figura 1, [7]). Este proceso se repite constantemente, proporcionando al usuario un aspecto limitado. Este enfoque es robusto y ampliamente aplicado, pero requiere sistemas que puedan describirse de manera eficiente con ecuaciones matemáticas. Bee extiende este enfoque de los comportamientos de los agentes, que se ajusta al comportamiento observado utilizando un algoritmo genético.3. Bee de arquitectura predice el futuro al observar el comportamiento emergente de los agentes que representan las entidades de interés en una simulación de agente de grano fino. Los elementos clave de la arquitectura de abejas incluyen el modelo de un agente individual, la infraestructura de feromonas a través de la cual interactúan los agentes, las fuentes de información que los guían y el ciclo evolutivo general que ejecutan.3.1 Modelo de agente Los agentes en Bee están inspirados en dos cuerpos de trabajo: nuestro trabajo anterior sobre agentes de grano fino que coordinan sus acciones a través de feromonas digitales en un entorno compartido [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], y el éxito deModelado de combate basado en agente anterior. Las feromonas digitales son variables escalares que los agentes depositan y sienten en su ubicación actual A C B D A C B D Figura 1: Seguimiento de un sistema dinámico no lineal.a = espacio de estado del sistema;b = trayectoria del sistema con el tiempo;C = Mediciones recientes del estado del sistema;D = predicción de corto alcance. El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 1427 en el medio ambiente. Los agentes responden a las concentraciones locales de estas variables tropialmente, escalando o descendiendo gradientes locales. Sus movimientos cambian los patrones de depósito. Este circuito de retroalimentación, junto con procesos de evaporación y propagación en el entorno, respaldan patrones complejos de interacción y coordinación entre los agentes [15]. La Tabla 1 muestra los sabores de feromonas actuales de las abejas. Por ejemplo, un miembro vivo del adversario emite una feromona de aliva roja, mientras que las carreteras emiten una feromona de movilidad. Nuestros agentes de soldados están inspirados en Einstein y Mana. Einstein [6] representa un agente como un conjunto de seis pesos, cada uno en [-1, 1], describiendo la respuesta de los agentes a seis tipos de información. Cuatro de estos describen el número de tropas enemigas enemigas vidas, amigables, amables y heridas y lesionadas dentro del rango de sensores de los agentes. Los otros dos pesos se relacionan con la distancia de los agentes a su propia bandera y la del adversario, representando objetivos que busca proteger y atacar, respectivamente. Un peso positivo indica atracción a la entidad descrita por el peso, mientras que un peso negativo indica repulsión. Mana [9] extiende los conceptos en Einstein. Las banderas amistosas y enemigas son reemplazadas por los puntos de referencia que siguen cada lado. El maná incluye enemigos bajos, medianos y de alta amenaza. Además, define un conjunto de desencadenantes (por ejemplo, alcanzar un punto de referencia, dispararse, hacer contacto con el enemigo, ser herido) que cambian al agente de un vector de personalidad a otro. Un estado predeterminado define el vector de personalidad cuando no hay estado de activación activo. Los vectores de personalidad en Mana y Einstein reflejan aspectos racionales y emotivos de la toma de decisiones. La noción de ser atraída o repelida por fuerzas amigables o adversas en varios estados de salud es un componente importante de lo que consideramos informalmente como emoción (por ejemplo, miedo, compasión, agresión) y el uso del término personalidad en Einstein yMana sugiere que los diseñadores de sistemas están pensando antropomórficamente, aunque no usan emoción para describir el efecto que están tratando de lograr. La noción de puntos de referencia a los que se atrae un agente refleja la racionalidad orientada a objetivos. Bee utiliza un modelo integrado de personalidad racional-emotiva. Una racionalidad de los agentes de abejas es un vector de siete deseos, que son valores en [-1, +1]: protectores (el adversario), Protectlue (fuerzas amigables), protección (civiles), protectores de protección, evitación de la detección y sobrevivir y sobrevivir. Los valores negativos invierten el sentido sugerido por la etiqueta. Por ejemplo, un valor negativo de Protectioned indica un deseo de dañar el rojo, y un agente con un alto deseo positivo de protectamente se sentirá atraído por la feromona redaliva, de casualidad roja y de movilidad, y se moverá a una velocidad máxima. El componente emotivo de una personalidad de las abejas se basa en el marco Ortony-Clore-Collins (OCC) [11], y se describe en detalle en otra parte [12]. OCC define las emociones como reacciones valiadas a los agentes, estados o eventos en el medio ambiente. Esta noción de reacción se captura en los estados de activación de Manas. Un avance importante en el modelo emocional de las abejas es el reconocimiento de que los agentes pueden diferir en lo sensibles que son los desencadenantes. Por ejemplo, las situaciones amenazantes tienden a estimular la emoción del miedo, pero un nivel determinado de amenaza producirá más miedo en un nuevo recluta que en un veterano experimentado. Por lo tanto, nuestro modelo incluye no solo emociones, sino también disposiciones. Cada emoción tiene una disposición correspondiente. Las disposiciones son relativamente estables y se consideran constantes durante el horizonte temporal de una carrera de la abeja, mientras que las emociones varían según la disposición de los agentes y los estímulos a los que está expuesto. Las entrevistas con expertos en dominios militares identificaron las dos emociones más cruciales para el comportamiento de combate como ira (con la irritabilidad de disposición correspondiente) y el miedo (cuya disposición es la cobardía). La Tabla 2 muestra qué feromonas desencadenan qué emociones. Por ejemplo, la feromona de casualidad roja estimula la ira y el miedo en un agente rojo, pero no en un agente azul. Las emociones se modelan como hormonas de agente (feromonas internas) que se aumentan en presencia de la condición ambiental desencadenante y se evaporan con el tiempo. Una emoción distinta de cero modifica las acciones de los agentes. El nivel elevado de la ira aumenta la probabilidad del movimiento, la probabilidad de disparo de armas y la tendencia hacia una postura expuesta. El miedo elevado disminuye estas probabilidades. La Figura 2 resume el modelo de personalidad de las abejas. El lado izquierdo es un modelo BDI directo (preferimos el término objetivo de intención). El lado derecho es el componente emotivo, donde una evaluación de las creencias de los agentes, moderadas por la disposición, conduce a una emoción que a su vez influye en el análisis BDI. Tabla 1.

Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 3.2 La gran innovación de las abejas de las abejas está extendiendo la técnica de sistemas no lineales de la Sección 2.2 a los comportamientos de los agentes. Esta sección describe este proceso a un alto nivel, luego detalla la infraestructura de feromonas de varias páginas que lo implementa.3.2.1 Descripción general La Figura 3 es una descripción general de la evolución del comportamiento y la extrapolación. Cada entidad activa en el espacio de batalla tiene un avatar persistente que genera continuamente una corriente de agentes fantasmas que se representan a sí mismo. Llamamos a la entidad de modelado combinada que consiste en avatar y fantasmas como polyagent [14]. Los fantasmas viven en una línea de tiempo indexada por el que comienza en el pasado y se encuentra con el futuro.se compensa con respecto a la hora actual t.La línea de tiempo se divide en páginas discretas, cada una que representa un valor sucesivo de. El avatar inserta los fantasmas en el horizonte de inserción. En nuestro sistema actual, el horizonte de inserción está en - t = -30, lo que significa que los fantasmas se insertan en una página que representa el estado del mundo hace 30 minutos. En el horizonte de inserción, cada fantasma de los parámetros de comportamiento (deseos y disposiciones) se muestrean de las distribuciones para explorar personalidades alternativas de la entidad que representa. Cada página entre el horizonte de inserción y = t (ahora) registra el estado histórico del mundo en el punto en el pasado al que corresponde. A medida que los fantasmas se mueven de una página a otra, interactúan con este estado pasado, en función de sus parámetros de comportamiento. Estas interacciones significan que su estado físico depende no solo de sus propias acciones, sino también de los comportamientos del resto de la población, que también está evolucionando. Porque avances más rápido que en tiempo real, eventualmente = t (tiempo real). En este punto, cada fantasma se evalúa en función de su ubicación en comparación con la ubicación real de su entidad del mundo real correspondiente. Los fantasmas más aptos tienen tres funciones.1. La personalidad de cada fantasma más apto para las entidades se informa al resto del sistema como la personalidad probable de esa entidad. Esta información nos permite caracterizar a los guerreros individuales como inusualmente cobardes o valientes.2. Los fantasmas más adecuados se reproducen genéticamente y sus descendientes regresan al horizonte de inserción para continuar el proceso de ajuste.3. Los fantasmas más aptos para cada entidad forman la base para una población de fantasmas que pasan por los avatares presentes en el futuro. Cada fantasma que se encuentra con el futuro explora un futuro posible diferente de la batalla, análoga a cómo algunas personas planean con anticipación simulando mentalmente diferentes formas en que se podría desarrollar una situación. El análisis de los comportamientos de estas diferentes posibles futuros produce predicciones. Por lo tanto, Bee tiene tres nociones distintas de tiempo, todas las cuales pueden ser distintas del tiempo del mundo real.1. El tiempo de dominio T es el momento actual en el dominio que se está modelando. Si Bee se aplica a una situación del mundo real, esta vez es lo mismo que el tiempo del mundo real. En nuestros experimentos, aplicamos Bee a una batalla simulada, y el tiempo de dominio es la marca de tiempo publicada por el simulador. Durante las ejecuciones reales, el simulador a menudo se detiene, por lo que el tiempo de dominio funciona más lento que en tiempo real. Cuando volvemos a reproducir registros de las ejecuciones de simulación, podemos acelerarlos para que el tiempo de dominio se ejecute más rápido que en tiempo real.2. El tiempo de abeja para una página registra el tiempo de dominio correspondiente al estado del mundo representado en esa página, y se compensa desde el tiempo de dominio actual.3. El tiempo de turno se incrementa cada vez que los fantasmas se mueven de una página a la siguiente. La relación entre el tiempo de cambio y el tiempo real depende de los recursos de procesamiento disponibles.3.2.2 La abeja de infraestructura de feromonas debe operar muy rápidamente, para mantener el ritmo de la batalla en curso. Por lo tanto, usamos agentes simples coordinados utilizando mecanismos de feromonas. Hemos descrito la dinámica básica de nuestra infraestructura de feromonas en otros lugares [2]. Esta infraestructura se ejecuta en los nodos de un entorno estructurado por gráficos (en el caso de la abeja, una red rectangular). Cada nodo mantiene un valor escalar para cada sabor de feromona, y proporciona tres funciones: agrega depósitos de agentes individuales, fusionando la información en múltiples agentes y a través del tiempo. Evapora las feromonas a lo largo del tiempo, proporcionando una alternativa innovadora al mantenimiento de la verdad tradicional. Tradicionalmente, las bases de conocimiento recuerdan todo lo que se les dice a menos que tengan una razón para olvidar. Los sistemas basados en feromonas inmediatamente comienzan a olvidar todo lo que aprenden, a menos que se refuerce continuamente. Por lo tanto, las inconsistencias se eliminan automáticamente dentro de un período conocido. Difune las feromonas a lugares cercanos, difundiendo información para el acceso por parte de agentes cercanos. La distribución de cada sabor a feromona sobre el entorno forma un campo que representa algún aspecto del estado del mundo en un instante en el tiempo. Cada página de la línea de tiempo es un campo de feromona completo para el mundo en el momento de la abeja representado por esa página. El comportamiento de las feromonas en cada página depende de si la página representa el pasado o el futuro.

Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 1429 En páginas que representan el futuro (> t), se aplican los mecanismos de feromonas habituales. Los fantasmas depositan la feromona cada vez que se mudan a una nueva página, y las feromonas se evaporan y se propagan de una página a la siguiente. En páginas que representan el pasado (t), tenemos un estado observado del mundo real. Esto tiene dos consecuencias para la gestión de feromonas. Primero, podemos generar los campos de feromona directamente desde las ubicaciones observadas de entidades individuales, por lo que no es necesario que los fantasmas hagan depósitos. En segundo lugar, podemos ajustar las intensidades de feromonas en función de las ubicaciones cambiadas de las entidades de una página a otra, por lo que no necesitamos evaporar o propagar las feromonas. Ambas simplificaciones reflejan el hecho de que en nuestro sistema actual, tenemos un conocimiento completo del pasado. Cuando presentamos el ruido y la incertidumbre, probablemente necesitaremos introducir feromonas dinámicas en el pasado y en el futuro. La ejecución de la infraestructura de feromona se realiza en dos escalas de tiempo, ejecutándose en hilos separados. El primer hilo actualiza el libro de las páginas cada vez que el tiempo de dominio avanza más allá del límite de la página siguiente. En cada paso, la primera página ahora + 1 se reemplaza con una nueva página actual, cuyas feromonas corresponden a las ubicaciones y fortalezas de las unidades observadas;Se agrega una página vacía en el horizonte de predicción;La página más antigua se descarta, ya que ha pasado el horizonte de inserción. El segundo hilo mueve los fantasmas de una página a la siguiente, tan rápido como lo permita el procesador. En cada paso, los fantasmas que alcanzan la página = t se evalúan para la aptitud y se eliminan o evolucionan;Se insertan nuevos fantasmas de los avatares y del proceso evolutivo en el horizonte de inserción;Una población de fantasmas basados en los fantasmas más aptos se insertan AT = t para llegar al futuro;Se eliminan los fantasmas que se han movido más allá del horizonte de predicción;Todos los fantasmas planean sus próximas acciones basadas en el campo de feromona en las páginas que ocupan actualmente;El sistema calcula el siguiente estado de cada página, incluida la ejecución de las acciones elegidas por los fantasmas, y (en páginas futuras) evaporando las feromonas y registrando nuevos depósitos de los fantasmas recientemente llegados. El movimiento fantasma basado en los gradientes de feromonas es un proceso simple, por lo que este sistema puede soportar poblaciones de agentes realistas sin una carga de computadora excesiva. En nuestro sistema actual, cada avatar genera ocho fantasmas por turno. Dado que hay alrededor de 50 entidades en el espacio de batalla (alrededor de 20 unidades de rojo y azul y aproximadamente 5 de verde), debemos apoyar a unos 400 fantasmas por página, o alrededor de 24000 en todo el libro. ¿Qué tan rápido un procesador necesitamos? Sea P la duración en tiempo real de una página en segundos. Si cada página representa 60 segundos de tiempo de dominio, y estamos reproduciendo una simulación en el tiempo de dominio 2x, p = 30. Sea n el número de páginas entre el horizonte de inserción y = t.En nuestro sistema actual, n = 30. Luego, una tasa de cambio de los cambios N/P por segundo permitirá que los fantasmas se ejecuten desde el horizonte de inserción hasta la hora actual al menos una vez antes de generar una nueva página. Empíricamente, este nivel es un límite más bajo para un rendimiento razonable y fácilmente alcanzable en las plataformas de stock Wintel.3.3 Fuentes de información La flexibilidad de la infraestructura de feromonas de las abejas permite la integración de numerosas fuentes de información como aportes a nuestras caracterizaciones de las personalidades de la entidad y las predicciones de su comportamiento futuro. Nuestro sistema actual se basa en tres fuentes de información, pero otras se pueden agregar fácilmente. Observaciones del mundo real. La Tabla 1 identifica las entidades que generan cada sabor de feromona. Estimaciones estadísticas de las regiones de amenaza. Técnicas estadísticas1 estiman el nivel de amenaza para cada fuerza (rojo o azul), basado en la topología del campo de batalla y la disposición conocida de las fuerzas. Por ejemplo, un área abierta amplia sin cobertura es amenazante, especialmente si la fuerza opuesta ocupa sus márgenes. Los resultados de este proceso se publican en las páginas de feromona como feromona rojiza (que representa una amenaza para rojo) y la feromona blueethreat (que representa una amenaza para el azul). Reconocimiento del plan basado en la IA.-Mientras el reconocimiento del plan no es suficiente para una predicción efectiva, es un aporte valioso. Configuramos dinámicamente una red de Bayes basada en la heurística para identificar los objetivos probables que cada entidad puede tener.2 Los destinos de estos objetivos funcionan como feromonas virtuales. Los fantasmas incluyen su distancia a tales puntos en sus decisiones de acción, logrando el resultado del gradiente seguido sin el gasto computacional de mantener un campo de feromona.4. Resultados experimentales Hemos probado la abeja en una serie de experimentos en los que los Wargamers humanos toman decisiones que se juegan en un simulador de campo de batalla. El comandante de cada lado (rojo y azul) tiene a su disposición un equipo de Pucksters, operadores humanos que establecen puntos de referencia para unidades individuales en el simulador. Cada Puckster es responsable de cuatro a seis unidades. El simulador mueve las unidades, determina las acciones de disparo y resuelve el resultado de los conflictos. Es importante enfatizar que este simulador es simplemente un sustituto de una alimentación de sensores de un campo de batalla del mundo real 4.1 Las disposiciones de ajuste para probar nuestra capacidad para adaptarse a las personalidades basadas en el comportamiento, un Puckster rojo responsable de cuatro unidades está designado por el Puckster emocional. Selecciona dos de sus unidades para ser cobardes (pollos) y dos para ser irritables (Rambos). No revela esta tarea durante la ejecución. Mueve cada unidad de acuerdo con las órdenes de los comandantes hasta que la unidad encuentre circunstancias que desencadenen la emoción asociada con la disposición de las unidades. Luego manipula los pollos como si tengan miedo (evitando el combate y alejarse del azul), y mueve a los rambos al combate lo más rápido posible. Nuestro software recibe informes de posición sobre todas las unidades, cada veinte segundos.1 Este proceso, conocido como SAD (detección de anomalías estadísticas), es desarrollado por nuestros colegas Rafael Alonso, Hua Li y John Asmuth en Sarnoff Corporation. Alonso y Li ahora están en Set Corporation.2 Este proceso, conocido como KIP (proyección de intención basada en el conocimiento), es desarrollado por nuestros colegas Paul Nielsen, Jacob Crossman y Rich Frederiksen en Soar Technology.1430 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07), la diferencia entre los dos valores de disposición (irritabilidad - cobardía) de los fantasmas más aptos demuestra un mejor indicador del estado emocional de la entidad correspondiente que cualquier valor por sí mismo. La Figura 4 muestra la disposición de Delta para cada uno de los ocho fantasmas más aptos en cada paso de tiempo, trazada contra el tiempo en segundos, para una unidad jugada como un pollo. Los valores claramente tentan negativamente. La Figura 5 muestra una gráfica similar para un Rambo. Los Rambos tienden a morir temprano, y a menudo no les dan tiempo a sus fantasmas para evolucionar una imagen clara de su personalidad, pero en este caso la disposición positiva del delta es evidente antes de que las unidades desaparezcan. Para caracterizar una personalidad de unidades, mantenemos un promedio móvil ponderado exponencialmente de 800 segundos de la disposición del Delta, y declaramos que la unidad es un pollo o rambo si este valor pasa un umbral negativo o positivo, respectivamente. Actualmente, este umbral se establece en 0.25. Estamos explorando filtros adicionales. Por ejemplo, una tasa de aumento rápida mejora la probabilidad de llamar a un rambo;Las unidades que buscan evitar la detección y evitar el combate se llaman más fácilmente el pollo. La Tabla 1 muestra los resultados de detección de unidades emocionales en una serie reciente de experimentos. Nunca llamamos a un Rambo un pollo. En el único caso en el que llamamos a un pollo un rambo, los registros muestran que, de hecho, la unidad se estaba jugando agresivamente, corriendo hacia las fuerzas azules que se aproximan. El valiente muere joven, por lo que casi nunca detectamos unidades jugadas intencionalmente como Rambos. La Figura 6 muestra una comparación en una serie separada de experimentos de nuestro detector de emociones en comparación con los humanos. Se jugaron dos cobardes en cada uno de los once juegos. Los observadores humanos en cada juego pudieron detectar un total de 13 de los cobardes. Bee pudo detectar cobardes (= pollos) mucho antes que el humano, mientras que solo faltaba un pollo que los humanos detectaron. Además de estos resultados en las unidades jugadas intencionalmente como emocionales, la abeja a veces detecta otras unidades como cobarde o valiente. El análisis de estas unidades muestra que estas caracterizaciones fueron apropiadas: las unidades que huyen frente a las fuerzas enemigas o el fuego de armas se detectan como pollos, mientras que aquellas que se mantienen firmes o apresuran al adversario se denominan Rambos.4.2 Predicciones integradas Cada fantasma que se ejecuta hacia el futuro genera una posible ruta que su unidad podría seguir. Los caminos en el conjunto resultante sobre todos los fantasmas varían en la probabilidad de que sean, el riesgo que representan en su lado o del lado opuesto, y así sucesivamente. En los experimentos informados aquí, seleccionamos el futuro cuyo fantasma recibe la mayor cantidad de orientación de las feromonas en el entorno en cada paso en el camino. En este sentido, es el futuro más probable. En estos experimentos, recibimos informes de posición solo en unidades que realmente han llegado dentro del rango visual de unidades azules, o en promedio menos de la mitad de las unidades rojas vivas en cualquier momento. Evaluamos las predicciones espacialmente, comparando una ubicación real de las entidades con la ubicación predicha 15 minutos antes. Comparamos la abeja con dos líneas de base: un predictor gametheorético basado en la geometría lingüística [22], y las estimaciones de los oficiales militares. En ambos casos, utilizamos una medida de precisión CEP (error circular) de precisión, el radio del círculo que uno tendría que dibujar alrededor de cada predicción para capturar el 50% de las ubicaciones de las unidades reales. Cuanto mayor sea la medida del CEP, peor será la precisión. La Figura 7 compara nuestra precisión con la del predictor gametheorético. Cada punto proporciona la medida mediana de CEP sobre todas las predicciones en una sola ejecución. Los puntos por encima de la abeja diagonal, mientras que los puntos por debajo de la línea favorecen al predictor teórico del juego. En todas menos dos misiones, Bee es más precisa. En una misión, los dos sistemas son comparables, mientras que en uno, el gametable 1: resultados experimentales en la disposición de ajuste (16 carreras) llamadas correctamente llamadas incorrectamente no llamados pollos 68% 5% 27% Rambos 5% 0% 95% Figura 4:Disposición delta para un pollo fantasmas.

El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 1431 El predictor teórico es más preciso. En 18 carreras de redadas, BEE generó 1405 predicciones en cada uno de los dos horizontes temporales (0 y 15 minutos), mientras que en 18 corridas no redactadas, el personal generó 102 predicciones. Cifra.8 muestra una gráfica de caja y whitcher de las medidas de CEP, en metros, de estas predicciones. La caja cubre el rango intercartil con una línea en la mediana, los bigotes se extienden a los puntos de datos más distantes dentro de 1.5 del rango intercuartil desde el borde de la caja, los cuadrados muestran atípicos dentro de 3 rangos intercuartiles, y las estrellas muestran más valores atípicos distantes. El puntaje mediano de las abejas incluso a los 15 minutos es más bajo que cualquiera de las mediana del personal. La prueba de Wilcoxon muestra que la diferencia entre las puntuaciones H15 es significativa en el nivel de 99.76%, mientras que la de las puntuaciones H0 es significativa con más del 99.999%.5. Conclusiones En muchos dominios, es importante razonar desde una entidad observó el comportamiento a una estimación de su estado interno, y luego extrapolar esa estimación para predecir el comportamiento futuro de las entidades. Bee realiza esta tarea utilizando una simulación más rápida de tiempo real de agentes de enjambre, coordinado a través de feromonas digitales. Esta simulación integra el conocimiento de las regiones de amenazas, un análisis cognitivo de las creencias, los deseos y las intenciones de los agentes, un modelo de disposición y estado emocional de los agentes, y la dinámica de las interacciones con el medio ambiente. Al evolucionar agentes en este rico entorno, podemos ajustar su estado interno a su comportamiento observado. En los juegos de guerra realistas, el sistema detecta con éxito las emociones jugadas deliberadamente y hace predicciones razonables sobre las entidades comportamientos futuros. La abeja solo puede modelar variables de estado interno que afectan el comportamiento externo de los agentes. No puede ajustarse a las variables que el agente no se manifiesta externamente, ya que la base del ciclo evolutivo es una comparación del comportamiento externo del agente simulado con la de la entidad real. Esta limitación es grave si nuestro propósito es comprender el estado interno de las entidades por su propio bien. Si nuestro propósito de ajustar a los agentes es predecir su comportamiento posterior, la limitación es mucho menos grave. Las variables de estado que no afectan el comportamiento, aunque invisibles para un análisis basado en el comportamiento, son irrelevantes para una predicción conductual. La arquitectura de abejas se presta a la extensión en varias direcciones prometedoras. Las diversas entradas integradas por la abeja son solo un ejemplo de los tipos de información que se puede manejar. El principio básico del uso de una simulación dinámica para integrar una amplia gama de influencias también puede extenderse a otras entradas, lo que requiere una ingeniería mucho menos adicional que otras formas más tradicionales de razonamiento sobre cómo las diferentes fuentes de conocimiento se unen para impactar el comportamiento de los agentes. Con tal cambio en las entradas, la abeja podría aplicarse más ampliamente que su dominio actual de razonamiento adversario en la guerra urbana. Las aplicaciones potenciales de interés incluyen juegos de computadora, estrategia comercial y fusión de sensores. Nuestro repertorio limitado inicial de emociones es un pequeño subconjunto de aquellos que han sido distinguidos por psicólogos, y que podría ser útil para comprender y proyectar el comportamiento. Esperamos extender el conjunto de emociones y las disposiciones de apoyo que Bee puede detectar. El mapeo entre un estado psicológico (cognitivo y emocional) de los agentes y su comportamiento externo no es uno a uno. Varios estados internos diferentes pueden ser consistentes con un comportamiento observado dado bajo un conjunto de condiciones ambientales, pero podrían producir comportamientos distintos en otras condiciones. Si el entorno en el pasado reciente es uno que confunde estados internos tan distintos, no podremos distinguirlos. Mientras el medio ambiente permanezca en este estado, nuestras predicciones serán precisas, cualquiera de los estados internos que asignamos al agente. Si el entorno cambia a uno bajo el cual los diferentes estados internos conducen a diferentes comportamientos, el uso del estado interno elegido previamente producirá predicciones inexactas. Una forma de abordar estas preocupaciones es investigar el mundo real, perturbándolo de manera que estimule comportamientos distintos de entidades cuyo estado psicológico es indistinguible. Tal sondeo es una técnica de inteligencia importante. La simulación más rápida que el tiempo real puede permitirnos identificar acciones de sondeo apropiadas, aumentando en gran medida la efectividad de los esfuerzos de inteligencia.6.

        "An agents beliefs are propositions about the state of the world that it considers true, based on its perceptions.",
        "Its desires are propositions about the world that it would like to be true.",
        "Desires are not necessarily consistent with one another: an agent might desire both to be rich and not to work at the same time.",

        "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
        "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",

        "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
        "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
        "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
        "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",

        "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",

        "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
        "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
        "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",

        "First, we can generate the pheromone fields directly from the observed locations of individual entities, so there is no need for the ghosts to make deposits.",
        "Second, we can adjust the pheromone intensities based on the changed locations of entities from page to page, so we do not need to evaporate or propagate the pheromones.",

        "Currently, this threshold is set at 0.25.",
        "We are exploring additional filters.",
        "For example, a rapid rate of increase enhances the likelihood of calling a Rambo; units that seek to avoid detection and avoid combat are more readily called chicken.",
        "Table 1 shows the detection results for emotional units in a recent series of experiments.",
        "We never called a Rambo a chicken.",
        "In the one case where we called a chicken a Rambo, logs show that in fact the unit was being played aggressively, rushing toward oncoming Blue forces.",
        "The brave die young, so we almost never detect units played intentionally as Rambos.",

        "Human observers in each game were able to detect a total of 13 of the cowards.",
        "BEE was able to detect cowards (= chickens) much earlier than the human, while missing only one chicken that the humans detected.",
        "In addition to these results on units intentionally played as emotional, BEE sometimes detects other units as cowardly or brave.",
        "Analysis of these units shows that these characterizations were appropriate: units that flee in the face of enemy forces or weapons fire are detected as chickens, while those that stand their ground or rush the adversary are denominated as Rambos. 4.2 Integrated Predictions Each ghost that runs into the future generates a possible path that its unit might follow.",
        "The paths in the resulting set over all ghosts vary in how likely they are, the risk they pose to their own or the opposite side, and so forth.",
        "In the experiments reported here, we select the future whose ghost receives the most guidance from pheromones in the environment at each step along the way.",
        "In this sense, it is the most likely future.",
        "In these experiments, we receive position reports only on units that have actually come within visual range of Blue units, or on average fewer than half of the live Red units at any time.",

        "By evolving agents in this rich environment, we can fit their internal state to their observed behavior.",
        "In realistic wargames, the system successfully detects deliberately played emotions and makes reasonable predictions about the entities future behaviors.",
        "BEE can only model internal state variables that impact the agents external behavior.",
        "It cannot fit variables that the agent does not manifest externally, since the basis for the evolutionary cycle is a comparison of the outward behavior of the simulated agent with that of the real entity.",
        "This limitation is serious if our purpose is to understand the entitys internal state for its own sake.",
        "If our purpose of fitting agents is to predict their subsequent behavior, the limitation is much less serious.",
        "State variables that do not impact behavior, while invisible to a behavior-based analysis, are irrelevant to a behavioral prediction.",

        "The basic principle of using a dynamical simulation to integrate a wide range of influences can be extended to other inputs as well, requiring much less additional engineering than other more traditional ways of reasoning about how different knowledge sources come together in impacting an agents behavior.",
        "With such a change in inputs, BEE could be applied more widely than its current domain of adversarial reasoning in urban warfare.",
        "Potential applications of interest include computer games, business strategy, and sensor fusion.",
        "Our initial limited repertoire of emotions is a small subset of those that have been distinguished by psychologists, and that might be useful for understanding and projecting behavior.",
        "We expect to extend the set of emotions and supporting dispositions that BEE can detect.",
        "The mapping between an agents psychological (cognitive and emotional) state and its outward behavior is not one-to-one.",
        "Several different internal states might be consistent with a given observed behavior under one set of environmental conditions, but might yield distinct behaviors under other conditions.",
        "If the environment in the recent past is one that confounds such distinct internal states, we will be unable to distinguish them.",
        "As long as the environment stays in this state, our predictions will be accurate, whichever of the internal states we assign to the agent.",
        "If the environment then shifts to one under which the different internal states lead to different behaviors, using the previously chosen internal state will yield inaccurate predictions.",
        "One way to address these concerns is to probe the real world, perturbing it in ways that would stimulate distinct behaviors from entities whose psychological state is otherwise indistinguishable.",
        "Such probing is an important intelligence technique.",

                "However, this behavior is driven by the agents internal state, which (in the case of a human) may involve high-level psychological and cognitive concepts such as intentions and emotions.",
                "A central challenge in many application domains is reasoning from external observations of agent behavior to an estimate of their internal state.",
                "Such reasoning is motivated by a desire to predict the agents behavior.",
                "This problem has traditionally been addressed under the rubric of plan recognition or plan inference.",
                "Work to date focuses almost entirely on recognizing the rational state (as opposed to the emotional state) of a single agent (as opposed to an interacting community), and frequently takes advantage of explicit communications between agents (as in managing conversational protocols).",

                "Domains that exhibit these constraints can often be characterized as adversarial, and include military combat, competitive business tactics, and multi-player computer games.",

                "An agents beliefs are propositions about the state of the world that it considers true, based on its perceptions.",

                "An agents intentions, or goals, are a subset of its desires that it has selected, based on its beliefs, to guide its future actions.",
                "Unlike desires, goals must be consistent with one another (or at least believed to be consistent by the agent).",
                "An agents goals guide its actions.",
                "Thus one ought to be able to learn something about an agents goals by observing its past actions, and knowledge of the agents goals in turn enables conclusions about what the agent may do in the future.",
                "This process of reasoning from an agents actions to its goals is known as plan recognition or plan inference.",

                "For example, in humancomputer interfaces, recognizing a users plan can enable the system to provide more appropriate information and options for user action.",
                "In a tutoring system, inferring the students plan is a first step to identifying buggy plans and providing appropriate remediation.",
                "In many cases, the higher-level function is predicting likely future actions by the entity whose plan is being inferred.",
                "We focus on plan recognition in support of prediction.",
                "An agents plan is a necessary input to a prediction of its future behavior, but hardly a sufficient one.",
                "At least two other influences, one internal and one external, need to be taken into account.",

                "A rational analysis of an agents goals may enable us to predict what it will attempt, but any nontrivial plan with several steps will depend sensitively at each step to the reaction of the environment, and our prediction must take this reaction into account as well.",
                "Actual simulation of futures is one way (the only one we know now) to deal with the impact of environmental dynamics on an agents actions.",
                "Human agents are also subject to an internal influence.",
                "The agents emotional state can modulate its decision process and its focus of attention (and thus its perception of the environment).",
                "In extreme cases, emotion can lead an agent to choose actions that from the standpoint of a logical analysis may appear irrational.",
                "Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",
                "That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents.",
                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",
                "This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations.",
                "BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors, which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm. 3.",
                "ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.",
                "Key elements of the BEE architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute. 3.1 Agent Model The agents in BEE are inspired by two bodies of work: our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through digital pheromones in a shared environment [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previous agentbased combat modeling.",

                "MANA includes low, medium, and high threat enemies.",
                "In addition, it defines a set of triggers (e.g., reaching a waypoint, being shot at, making contact with the enemy, being injured) that shift the agent from one personality vector to another.",

                "The personality vectors in MANA and EINSTein reflect both rational and emotive aspects of decision-making.",
                "The notion of being attracted or repelled by friendly or adversarial forces in various states of health is an important component of what we informally think of as emotion (e.g., fear, compassion, aggression), and the use of the term personality in both EINSTein and MANA suggests that the system designers are thinking anthropomorphically, though they do not use emotion to describe the effect they are trying to achieve.",
                "The notion of waypoints to which an agent is attracted reflects goal-oriented rationality.",
                "BEE uses an integrated rational-emotive personality model.",

                "Negative values reverse the sense suggested by the label.",
                "For example, a negative value of ProtectRed indicates a desire to harm Red, and an agent with a high positive desire to ProtectRed will be attracted to REDALIVE, RED-CASUALTY, and MOBILITY pheromone, and will move at maximum speed.",
                "The emotive component of a BEEs personality is based on the Ortony-Clore-Collins (OCC) framework [11], and is described in detail elsewhere [12].",

                "For example, threatening situations tend to stimulate the emotion of fear, but a given level of threat will produce more fear in a new recruit than in a seasoned veteran.",

                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",

                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",

                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",

                "Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",

                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",

                "Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",
                "That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents.",
                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",
                "This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations.",
                "BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors, which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm. 3.",
                "ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.",

                "Our observations are often limited to the agents external behavior, which can frequently be summarized numerically as a trajectory in space-time (perhaps punctuated by actions from a fairly limited vocabulary).",
                "However, this behavior is driven by the agents internal state, which (in the case of a human) may involve high-level psychological and cognitive concepts such as intentions and emotions.",
                "A central challenge in many application domains is reasoning from external observations of agent behavior to an estimate of their internal state.",
                "Such reasoning is motivated by a desire to predict the agents behavior.",
                "This problem has traditionally been addressed under the rubric of plan recognition or plan inference.",
                "Work to date focuses almost entirely on recognizing the rational state (as opposed to the emotional state) of a single agent (as opposed to an interacting community), and frequently takes advantage of explicit communications between agents (as in managing conversational protocols).",
                "Many realistic problems deviate from these conditions.",
                "Increasing the number of agents leads to a combinatorial explosion that can swamp conventional analysis.",
                "Environmental dynamics can frustrate agent intentions.",
                "The agents often are trying to hide their intentions (and even their presence), rather than intentionally sharing information.",
                "An agents emotional state may be at least as important as its rational state in determining its behavior.",
                "Domains that exhibit these constraints can often be characterized as adversarial, and include military combat, competitive business tactics, and multi-player computer games.",
                "BEE (Behavioral Evolution and Extrapolation) is a novel approach to recognizing the rational and emotional state of multiple interacting agents based solely on their behavior, without recourse to intentional communications from them.",
                "It is inspired by techniques used to predict the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems, in which a representation of the system is continually fit to its recent past behavior.",

                "PREVIOUS WORK BEE bears comparison with previous research in AI (plan recognition), Hidden Markov Models, and nonlinear dynamics systems (trajectory prediction). 2.1 Plan Recognition in AI Agent theory commonly describes an agents cognitive state in terms of its beliefs, desires, and intentions (the so-called BDI model [5, 20]).",
                "An agents beliefs are propositions about the state of the world that it considers true, based on its perceptions.",
                "Its desires are propositions about the world that it would like to be true.",
                "Desires are not necessarily consistent with one another: an agent might desire both to be rich and not to work at the same time.",
                "An agents intentions, or goals, are a subset of its desires that it has selected, based on its beliefs, to guide its future actions.",
                "Unlike desires, goals must be consistent with one another (or at least believed to be consistent by the agent).",
                "An agents goals guide its actions.",
                "Thus one ought to be able to learn something about an agents goals by observing its past actions, and knowledge of the agents goals in turn enables conclusions about what the agent may do in the future.",
                "This process of reasoning from an agents actions to its goals is known as plan recognition or plan inference.",
                "This body of work (surveyed recently at [3]) is rich and varied.",
                "It covers both single-agent and multi-agent (e.g., robot soccer team) plans, intentional vs. non-intentional actions, speech vs. non-speech behavior, adversarial vs. cooperative intent, complete vs. incomplete world knowledge, and correct vs. faulty plans, among other dimensions.",
                "Plan recognition is seldom pursued for its own sake.",
                "It usually supports a higher-level function.",
                "For example, in humancomputer interfaces, recognizing a users plan can enable the system to provide more appropriate information and options for user action.",
                "In a tutoring system, inferring the students plan is a first step to identifying buggy plans and providing appropriate remediation.",
                "In many cases, the higher-level function is predicting likely future actions by the entity whose plan is being inferred.",
                "We focus on plan recognition in support of prediction.",
                "An agents plan is a necessary input to a prediction of its future behavior, but hardly a sufficient one.",
                "At least two other influences, one internal and one external, need to be taken into account.",
                "The external influence is the dynamics of the environment, which may include other agents.",
                "The dynamics of the real world impose significant constraints.",
                "The environment may interfere with the desires of the agent [4, 10].",
                "Most interactions among agents, and between agents and the world, are nonlinear.",
                "When iterated, these can generate chaos (extreme sensitivity to initial conditions).",
                "A rational analysis of an agents goals may enable us to predict what it will attempt, but any nontrivial plan with several steps will depend sensitively at each step to the reaction of the environment, and our prediction must take this reaction into account as well.",
                "Actual simulation of futures is one way (the only one we know now) to deal with the impact of environmental dynamics on an agents actions.",
                "Human agents are also subject to an internal influence.",
                "The agents emotional state can modulate its decision process and its focus of attention (and thus its perception of the environment).",
                "In extreme cases, emotion can lead an agent to choose actions that from the standpoint of a logical analysis may appear irrational.",
                "Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",
                "That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents.",
                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",
                "This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations.",
                "BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors, which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm. 3.",
                "ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.",
                "Key elements of the BEE architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute. 3.1 Agent Model The agents in BEE are inspired by two bodies of work: our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through digital pheromones in a shared environment [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previous agentbased combat modeling.",
                "Digital pheromones are scalar variables that agents deposit and sense at their current location a c b d a c b d Figure 1: Tracking a nonlinear dynamical system. a = system state space; b = system trajectory over time; c = recent measurements of system state; d = short-range prediction.",

                "Friendly and enemy flags are replaced by the waypoints pursued by each side.",
                "MANA includes low, medium, and high threat enemies.",
                "In addition, it defines a set of triggers (e.g., reaching a waypoint, being shot at, making contact with the enemy, being injured) that shift the agent from one personality vector to another.",
                "A default state defines the personality vector when no trigger state is active.",
                "The personality vectors in MANA and EINSTein reflect both rational and emotive aspects of decision-making.",
                "The notion of being attracted or repelled by friendly or adversarial forces in various states of health is an important component of what we informally think of as emotion (e.g., fear, compassion, aggression), and the use of the term personality in both EINSTein and MANA suggests that the system designers are thinking anthropomorphically, though they do not use emotion to describe the effect they are trying to achieve.",
                "The notion of waypoints to which an agent is attracted reflects goal-oriented rationality.",
                "BEE uses an integrated rational-emotive personality model.",
                "A BEE agents rationality is a vector of seven desires, which are values in [-1, +1]: ProtectRed (the adversary), ProtectBlue (friendly forces), ProtectGreen (civilians), ProtectKeySites, AvoidCombat, AvoidDetection, and Survive.",
                "Negative values reverse the sense suggested by the label.",
                "For example, a negative value of ProtectRed indicates a desire to harm Red, and an agent with a high positive desire to ProtectRed will be attracted to REDALIVE, RED-CASUALTY, and MOBILITY pheromone, and will move at maximum speed.",
                "The emotive component of a BEEs personality is based on the Ortony-Clore-Collins (OCC) framework [11], and is described in detail elsewhere [12].",
                "OCC define emotions as valanced reactions to agents, states, or events in the environment.",
                "This notion of reaction is captured in MANAs trigger states.",
                "An important advance in BEEs emotional model is the recognition that agents may differ in how sensitive they are to triggers.",
                "For example, threatening situations tend to stimulate the emotion of fear, but a given level of threat will produce more fear in a new recruit than in a seasoned veteran.",
                "Thus our model includes not only Emotions, but Dispositions.",
                "Each Emotion has a corresponding <br>disposition</br>.",
                "Dispositions are relatively stable, and considered constant over the time horizon of a run of the BEE, while Emotions vary based on the agents <br>disposition</br> and the stimuli to which it is exposed.",
                "Interviews with military domain experts identified the two most crucial emotions for combat behavior as Anger (with the corresponding <br>disposition</br> Irritability) and Fear (whose <br>disposition</br> is Cowardice).",
                "Table 2 shows which pheromones trigger which emotions.",

                "Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents <br>future behavior</br> (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",
                "That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents.",
                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",
                "This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations.",
                "BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors, which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm. 3.",
                "ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.",
                "Key elements of the BEE architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute. 3.1 Agent Model The agents in BEE are inspired by two bodies of work: our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through digital pheromones in a shared environment [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previous agentbased combat modeling.",

                "In addition, it defines a set of triggers (e.g., reaching a waypoint, being shot at, making contact with the enemy, being injured) that shift the agent from one personality vector to another.",

                "The personality vectors in MANA and EINSTein reflect both rational and emotive aspects of decision-making.",
                "The notion of being attracted or repelled by friendly or adversarial forces in various states of health is an important component of what we informally think of as emotion (e.g., fear, compassion, aggression), and the use of the term personality in both EINSTein and MANA suggests that the system designers are thinking anthropomorphically, though they do not use emotion to describe the effect they are trying to achieve.",
                "The notion of waypoints to which an agent is attracted reflects goal-oriented rationality.",
                "BEE uses an integrated rational-emotive personality model.",
                "A BEE agents rationality is a vector of seven desires, which are values in [-1, +1]: ProtectRed (the adversary), ProtectBlue (friendly forces), ProtectGreen (civilians), ProtectKeySites, AvoidCombat, AvoidDetection, and Survive.",
                "Negative values reverse the sense suggested by the label.",
                "For example, a negative value of ProtectRed indicates a desire to harm Red, and an agent with a high positive desire to ProtectRed will be attracted to REDALIVE, RED-CASUALTY, and MOBILITY pheromone, and will move at maximum speed.",
                "The emotive component of a BEEs personality is based on the Ortony-Clore-Collins (OCC) framework [11], and is described in detail elsewhere [12].",
                "OCC define emotions as valanced reactions to agents, states, or events in the environment.",
                "This notion of reaction is captured in MANAs trigger states.",
                "An important advance in BEEs emotional model is the recognition that agents may differ in how sensitive they are to triggers.",
                "For example, threatening situations tend to stimulate the emotion of fear, but a given level of threat will produce more fear in a new recruit than in a seasoned veteran.",
                "Thus our model includes not only Emotions, but Dispositions.",

                "In extreme cases, emotion can lead an agent to choose actions that from the standpoint of a logical analysis may appear irrational.",
                "Current work on <br>plan recognition</br> for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",
                "That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents.",
                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",
                "This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations.",
                "BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors, which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm. 3.",
                "ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.",
                "Key elements of the BEE architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute. 3.1 Agent Model The agents in BEE are inspired by two bodies of work: our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through digital pheromones in a shared environment [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previous agentbased combat modeling.",

                "MANA includes low, medium, and high threat enemies.",
                "In addition, it defines a set of triggers (e.g., reaching a waypoint, being shot at, making contact with the enemy, being injured) that shift the agent from one personality vector to another.",

                "Negative values reverse the sense suggested by the label.",
                "For example, a negative value of ProtectRed indicates a desire to harm Red, and an agent with a high positive desire to ProtectRed will be attracted to REDALIVE, RED-CASUALTY, and MOBILITY pheromone, and will move at maximum speed.",
                "The emotive component of a BEEs personality is based on the Ortony-Clore-Collins (OCC) framework [11], and is described in detail elsewhere [12].",

                "Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",
                "That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents.",
                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",
                "This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations.",

                "ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.",

                "BEE uses an integrated rational-emotive personality model.",

                "Negative values reverse the sense suggested by the label.",
                "For example, a negative value of ProtectRed indicates a desire to harm Red, and an agent with a high positive desire to ProtectRed will be attracted to REDALIVE, RED-CASUALTY, and MOBILITY pheromone, and will move at maximum speed.",
                "The emotive component of a BEEs personality is based on the Ortony-Clore-Collins (OCC) framework [11], and is described in detail elsewhere [12].",

                "Each Emotion has a corresponding Disposition.",
                "Dispositions are relatively stable, and considered constant over the time horizon of a run of the BEE, while Emotions vary based on the agents disposition and the stimuli to which it is exposed.",

                "An agents beliefs are propositions about the state of the world that it considers true, based on its perceptions.",

                "We focus on plan recognition in support of prediction.",
                "An agents plan is a necessary input to a prediction of its future behavior, but hardly a sufficient one.",

                "A rational analysis of an agents goals may enable us to predict what it will attempt, but any nontrivial plan with several steps will depend sensitively at each step to the reaction of the environment, and our prediction must take this reaction into account as well.",
                "Actual simulation of futures is one way (the only one we know now) to deal with the impact of environmental dynamics on an agents actions.",
                "Human agents are also subject to an internal influence.",

                "Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by <br>evolution</br> in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",
                "That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents.",
                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",
                "This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations.",
                "BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors, which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm. 3.",
                "ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.",
                "Key elements of the BEE architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute. 3.1 Agent Model The agents in BEE are inspired by two bodies of work: our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through digital pheromones in a shared environment [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previous agentbased combat modeling.",

                "Negative values reverse the sense suggested by the label.",
                "For example, a negative value of ProtectRed indicates a desire to harm Red, and an agent with a high positive desire to ProtectRed will be attracted to REDALIVE, RED-CASUALTY, and MOBILITY pheromone, and will move at maximum speed.",

                "However, this behavior is driven by the agents internal state, which (in the case of a human) may involve high-level psychological and cognitive concepts such as intentions and emotions.",
                "A central challenge in many application domains is reasoning from external observations of agent behavior to an estimate of their internal state.",
                "Such reasoning is motivated by a desire to predict the agents behavior.",
                "This problem has traditionally been addressed under the rubric of plan recognition or plan inference.",
                "Work to date focuses almost entirely on recognizing the rational state (as opposed to the emotional state) of a single agent (as opposed to an interacting community), and frequently takes advantage of explicit communications between agents (as in managing conversational protocols).",

                "An agents goals guide its actions.",
                "Thus one ought to be able to learn something about an agents goals by observing its past actions, and knowledge of the agents goals in turn enables conclusions about what the agent may do in the future.",

                "In many cases, the higher-level function is predicting likely future actions by the entity whose plan is being inferred.",
                "We focus on plan recognition in support of <br>prediction</br>.",
                "An agents plan is a necessary input to a <br>prediction</br> of its future behavior, but hardly a sufficient one.",
                "At least two other influences, one internal and one external, need to be taken into account.",
                "The external influence is the dynamics of the environment, which may include other agents.",

                "A rational analysis of an agents goals may enable us to predict what it will attempt, but any nontrivial plan with several steps will depend sensitively at each step to the reaction of the environment, and our <br>prediction</br> must take this reaction into account as well.",
                "Actual simulation of futures is one way (the only one we know now) to deal with the impact of environmental dynamics on an agents actions.",
                "Human agents are also subject to an internal influence.",
                "The agents emotional state can modulate its decision process and its focus of attention (and thus its perception of the environment).",
                "In extreme cases, emotion can lead an agent to choose actions that from the standpoint of a logical analysis may appear irrational.",
                "Current work on plan recognition for <br>prediction</br> focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",
                "That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents.",
                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range <br>prediction</br> of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",
                "This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations.",
                "BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors, which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm. 3.",
                "ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.",
                "Key elements of the BEE architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute. 3.1 Agent Model The agents in BEE are inspired by two bodies of work: our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through digital pheromones in a shared environment [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previous agentbased combat modeling.",

                "However, this behavior is driven by the agents internal state, which (in the case of a human) may involve high-level psychological and cognitive concepts such as intentions and emotions.",
                "A central challenge in many application domains is reasoning from external observations of agent behavior to an estimate of their internal state.",
                "Such reasoning is motivated by a desire to predict the agents behavior.",
                "This problem has traditionally been addressed under the rubric of plan recognition or plan inference.",
                "Work to date focuses almost entirely on recognizing the rational state (as opposed to the emotional state) of a single agent (as opposed to an interacting community), and frequently takes advantage of explicit communications between agents (as in managing conversational protocols).",

                "Thus one ought to be able to learn something about an agents goals by observing its past actions, and knowledge of the agents goals in turn enables conclusions about what the agent may do in the future.",

                "In many cases, the higher-level function is predicting likely future actions by the entity whose plan is being inferred.",
                "We focus on plan recognition in support of prediction.",
                "An agents plan is a necessary input to a prediction of its future behavior, but hardly a sufficient one.",
                "At least two other influences, one internal and one external, need to be taken into account.",
                "The external influence is the dynamics of the environment, which may include other agents.",

                "A rational analysis of an agents goals may enable us to predict what it will attempt, but any nontrivial plan with several steps will depend sensitively at each step to the reaction of the environment, and our prediction must take this reaction into account as well.",
                "Actual simulation of futures is one way (the only one we know now) to deal with the impact of environmental dynamics on an agents actions.",
                "Human agents are also subject to an internal influence.",
                "The agents emotional state can modulate its decision process and its focus of attention (and thus its perception of the environment).",
                "In extreme cases, emotion can lead an agent to choose actions that from the standpoint of a logical analysis may appear irrational.",
                "Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",
                "That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents.",
                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",
                "This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations.",
                "BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors, which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm. 3.",
                "ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.",
                "Key elements of the BEE architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute. 3.1 Agent Model The agents in BEE are inspired by two bodies of work: our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through digital pheromones in a shared environment [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previous agentbased combat modeling.",

                "However, this behavior is driven by the agents internal state, which (in the case of a human) may involve high-level psychological and cognitive concepts such as intentions and emotions.",
                "A central challenge in many application domains is reasoning from external observations of agent behavior to an estimate of their internal state.",
                "Such reasoning is motivated by a desire to predict the agents behavior.",
                "This problem has traditionally been addressed under the rubric of plan recognition or plan inference.",
                "Work to date focuses almost entirely on recognizing the rational state (as opposed to the emotional state) of a single agent (as opposed to an interacting community), and frequently takes advantage of explicit communications between agents (as in managing conversational protocols).",

                "A rational analysis of an agents goals may enable us to predict what it will attempt, but any nontrivial plan with several steps will depend sensitively at each step to the reaction of the environment, and our prediction must take this reaction into account as well.",
                "Actual simulation of futures is one way (the only one we know now) to deal with the impact of environmental dynamics on an agents actions.",
                "Human agents are also subject to an internal influence.",

                "Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",
                "That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents.",
                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",
                "This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations.",
                "BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors, which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm. 3.",
                "ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.",
                "Key elements of the BEE architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute. 3.1 Agent Model The agents in BEE are inspired by two bodies of work: our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through digital pheromones in a shared environment [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previous agentbased combat modeling.",

                "The notion of being attracted or repelled by friendly or adversarial forces in various states of health is an important component of what we informally think of as emotion (e.g., fear, compassion, aggression), and the use of the term personality in both EINSTein and MANA suggests that the system designers are thinking anthropomorphically, though they do not use emotion to describe the effect they are trying to achieve.",

                "Our available information is often limited to observations of the agents external behavior in the past and present.",

                "BEE (Behavior Evolution and Extrapolation) uses a faster-than-real-time agentbased model of the environment to characterize agents internal state by evolution against observed behavior, and then predict their future behavior, taking into account the dynamics of their interaction with the environment.",

                "Our observations are often limited to the agents external behavior, which can frequently be summarized numerically as a trajectory in space-time (perhaps punctuated by actions from a fairly limited vocabulary).",
                "However, this behavior is driven by the agents internal state, which (in the case of a human) may involve high-level psychological and cognitive concepts such as intentions and emotions.",
                "A central challenge in many application domains is reasoning from external observations of agent behavior to an estimate of their internal state.",
                "Such reasoning is motivated by a desire to predict the agents behavior.",
                "This problem has traditionally been addressed under the rubric of plan recognition or plan inference.",
                "Work to date focuses almost entirely on recognizing the rational state (as opposed to the emotional state) of a single agent (as opposed to an interacting community), and frequently takes advantage of explicit communications between agents (as in managing conversational protocols).",
                "Many realistic problems deviate from these conditions.",
                "Increasing the number of agents leads to a combinatorial explosion that can swamp conventional analysis.",
                "Environmental dynamics can frustrate agent intentions.",
                "The agents often are trying to hide their intentions (and even their presence), rather than intentionally sharing information.",
                "An agents emotional state may be at least as important as its rational state in determining its behavior.",
                "Domains that exhibit these constraints can often be characterized as adversarial, and include military combat, competitive business tactics, and multi-player computer games.",
                "BEE (Behavioral Evolution and Extrapolation) is a novel approach to recognizing the rational and emotional state of multiple interacting agents based solely on their behavior, without recourse to intentional communications from them.",
                "It is inspired by techniques used to predict the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems, in which a representation of the system is continually fit to its recent past behavior.",
                "For nonlinear dynamical systems, the representation is a closed-form mathematical equation.",
                "In BEE, it is a set of parameters governing the behavior of software agents representing the individuals being analyzed.",

                "PREVIOUS WORK BEE bears comparison with previous research in AI (plan recognition), Hidden Markov Models, and nonlinear dynamics systems (trajectory prediction). 2.1 Plan Recognition in AI Agent theory commonly describes an agents cognitive state in terms of its beliefs, desires, and intentions (the so-called BDI model [5, 20]).",
                "An agents beliefs are propositions about the state of the world that it considers true, based on its perceptions.",
                "Its desires are propositions about the world that it would like to be true.",
                "Desires are not necessarily consistent with one another: an agent might desire both to be rich and not to work at the same time.",
                "An agents intentions, or goals, are a subset of its desires that it has selected, based on its beliefs, to guide its future actions.",
                "Unlike desires, goals must be consistent with one another (or at least believed to be consistent by the agent).",
                "An agents goals guide its actions.",
                "Thus one ought to be able to learn something about an agents goals by observing its past actions, and knowledge of the agents goals in turn enables conclusions about what the agent may do in the future.",
                "This process of reasoning from an agents actions to its goals is known as plan recognition or plan inference.",
                "This body of work (surveyed recently at [3]) is rich and varied.",
                "It covers both single-agent and multi-agent (e.g., robot soccer team) plans, intentional vs. non-intentional actions, speech vs. non-speech behavior, adversarial vs. cooperative intent, complete vs. incomplete world knowledge, and correct vs. faulty plans, among other dimensions.",
                "Plan recognition is seldom pursued for its own sake.",
                "It usually supports a higher-level function.",
                "For example, in humancomputer interfaces, recognizing a users plan can enable the system to provide more appropriate information and options for user action.",
                "In a tutoring system, inferring the students plan is a first step to identifying buggy plans and providing appropriate remediation.",
                "In many cases, the higher-level function is predicting likely future actions by the entity whose plan is being inferred.",
                "We focus on plan recognition in support of prediction.",
                "An agents plan is a necessary input to a prediction of its future behavior, but hardly a sufficient one.",
                "At least two other influences, one internal and one external, need to be taken into account.",
                "The external influence is the dynamics of the environment, which may include other agents.",
                "The dynamics of the real world impose significant constraints.",
                "The environment may interfere with the desires of the agent [4, 10].",
                "Most interactions among agents, and between agents and the world, are nonlinear.",
                "When iterated, these can generate chaos (extreme sensitivity to initial conditions).",
                "A rational analysis of an agents goals may enable us to predict what it will attempt, but any nontrivial plan with several steps will depend sensitively at each step to the reaction of the environment, and our prediction must take this reaction into account as well.",
                "Actual simulation of futures is one way (the only one we know now) to deal with the impact of environmental dynamics on an agents actions.",
                "Human agents are also subject to an internal influence.",
                "The agents emotional state can modulate its decision process and its focus of attention (and thus its perception of the environment).",
                "In extreme cases, emotion can lead an agent to choose actions that from the standpoint of a logical analysis may appear irrational.",
                "Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan, and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases.",
                "BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions. 2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs [19]).",
                "In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agents personality) and observable state (its outward behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMMs) and then predict the agents future behavior (by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMMs).",
                "BEE offers two important benefits over HMMs.",
                "First, a single agents hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property.",
                "That is, their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t, but also on the hidden variables of other agents.",
                "One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents, but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive.",
                "BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them.",
                "Second, Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary.",
                "This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations.",
                "BEEs evolutionary process continually updates the agents personalities based on actual observations, and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents personalities. 2.3 Real-Time Nonlinear Systems Fitting Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time.",
                "The dimensions of the vector define the systems state space.",
                "One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations, e.g., )(xf dt xd .",
                "When f is nonlinear, the system can be formally chaotic, and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly.",
                "Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible.",
                "However, it is often useful to anticipate the systems behavior a short distance into the future.",
                "A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the systems trajectory in the recent past, then extrapolate this fit into the future (Figure 1, [7]).",
                "This process is repeated constantly, providing the user with a limited look-ahead.",
                "This approach is robust and widely applied, but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations.",
                "BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors, which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm. 3.",
                "ARCHITECTURE BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.",
                "Key elements of the BEE architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute. 3.1 Agent Model The agents in BEE are inspired by two bodies of work: our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through digital pheromones in a shared environment [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previous agentbased combat modeling.",

                "The notion of being attracted or repelled by friendly or adversarial forces in various states of health is an important component of what we informally think of as emotion (e.g., fear, compassion, aggression), and the use of the term personality in both EINSTein and MANA suggests that the system designers are thinking anthropomorphically, though they do not use emotion to describe the effect they are trying to achieve.",

                "Negative values reverse the sense suggested by the label.",
                "For example, a negative value of ProtectRed indicates a desire to harm Red, and an agent with a high positive desire to ProtectRed will be attracted to REDALIVE, RED-CASUALTY, and MOBILITY pheromone, and will move at maximum speed.",

                "For example, threatening situations tend to stimulate the emotion of fear, but a given level of threat will produce more fear in a new recruit than in a seasoned veteran.",
                "Thus our model includes not only Emotions, but Dispositions.",

                "Dispositions are relatively stable, and considered constant over the time horizon of a run of the BEE, while Emotions vary based on the agents disposition and the stimuli to which it is exposed.",
