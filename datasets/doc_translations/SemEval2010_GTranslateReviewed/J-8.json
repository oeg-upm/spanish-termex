We study the graph topologies that guarantee the existence of a strong equilibrium (where no coalition can improve the cost of each of its members) regardless of the specific costs on the edges. Our main existence results are the following: (1) For a single source and sink we show that there is always a strong equilibrium (both for fair and general connection games). (2) For a single source multiple sinks we show that for a series parallel graph a strong equilibrium always exists (both for fair and general connection games). (3) For multi source and sink we show that an extension parallel graph always admits a strong equilibrium in fair connection games. As for the quality of the strong equilibrium we show that in any fair connection games the cost of a strong equilibrium is Θ(log n) from the optimal solution, where n is the number of players. (This should be contrasted with the Ω(n) price of anarchy for the same setting.) For single source general connection games and single source single sink fair connection games, we show that a strong equilibrium is always an optimal solution.

INTRODUCTION Computational game theory has introduced the issue of incentives to many of the classical combinatorial optimization problems. The view that the demand side is many times not under the control of a central authority that optimizes the global performance, but rather under the control of individuals with different incentives, has led already to many important insights. Consider classical routing and transportation problems such as multicast or multi-commodity problems, which are many times viewed as follows. We are given a graph with edge costs and connectivity demands between nodes, and our goal is to find a minimal cost solution. The classical centralized approach assumes that all the individual demands can both be completely coordinated and have no individual incentives. The game theory point of view would assume that each individual demand is controlled by a player that optimizes its own utility, and the resulting outcome could be far from the optimal solution. When considering individual incentives one needs to discuss the appropriate solution concept. Much of the research in computational game theory has focused on the classical Nash equilibrium as the primary solution concept. Indeed Nash equilibrium has many benefits, and most importantly it always exists (in mixed strategies). However, the solution concept of Nash equilibrium is resilient only to unilateral deviations, while in reality, players may be able to coordinate their actions. A strong equilibrium [4] is a state from which no coalition (of any size) can deviate and improve the utility of every member of the coalition (while possibly lowering the utility 84 of players outside the coalition). This resilience to deviations by coalitions of the players is highly attractive, and one can hope that once a strong equilibrium is reached it is highly likely to sustain. From a computational game theory point of view, an additional benefit of a strong equilibrium is that it has a potential to reduce the distance between the optimal solution and the solution obtained as an outcome of selfish behavior. The strong price of anarchy (SPoA), introduced in [1], is the ratio between the cost of the worst strong equilibrium and the cost of an optimal solution. Obviously, SPoA is meaningful only in those cases where a strong equilibrium exists. A major downside of strong equilibrium is that most games do not admit any strong equilibrium. Even simple classical games like the prisoners dilemma do not posses any strong equilibrium (which is also an example of a congestion game that does not posses a strong equilibrium1 ). This unfortunate fact has reduced the concentration in strong equilibrium, despite its highly attractive properties. Yet, [1] have identified two broad families of games, namely job scheduling and network formation, where a strong equilibrium always exists and the SPoA is significantly lower than the price of anarchy (which is the ratio between the worst Nash equilibrium and the optimal solution [15, 18, 5, 6]). In this work we concentrate on cost sharing connection games, introduced by [3, 2]. In such a game, there is an underlying directed graph with edge costs, and individual users have connectivity demands (between a source and a sink). We consider two models. The fair cost connection model [2] allows each player to select a path from the source to the sink2 . In this game the cost of an edge is shared equally between all the players that selected the edge, and the cost of the player is the sum of its costs on the edges it selected. The general connection game [3] allows each player to offer prices for edges. In this game an edge is bought if the sum of the offers at least covers its cost, and the cost of the player is the sum of its offers on the bought edges (in both games we assume that the player has to guarantee the connectivity between its source and sink). In this work we focus on two important issues. The first one is identifying under what conditions the existence of a strong equilibrium is guaranteed, and the second one is the quality of the strong equilibria. For the existence part, we identify families of graph topologies that possess some strong equilibrium for any assignment of edge costs. One can view this separation between the graph topology and the edge costs, as a separation between the underlying infrastructure and the costs the players observe to purchase edges. While one expects the infrastructure to be stable over long periods of time, the costs the players observe can be easily modified over short time periods. Such a topological characterization of the underlying infrastructure provides a network designer topological conditions that will ensure stability in his network. Our results are as follows. For the single commodity case (all the players have the same source and sink), there is a strong equilibrium in any graph (both for fair and general connection games). Moreover, the strong equilibrium is also 1 while any congestion game is known to admit at least one Nash equilibrium in pure strategies [16]. 2 The fair cost sharing scheme is also attractive from a mechanism design point of view, as it is a strategyproof costsharing mechanism [14]. the optimal solution (namely, the players share a shortest path from the common source to the common sink). For the case of a single source and multiple sinks (for example, in a multicast tree), we show that in a fair connection game there is a strong equilibrium if the underlying graph is a series parallel graph, and we show an example of a nonseries parallel graph that does not have a strong equilibrium. For the case of multi-commodity (multi sources and sinks), we show that in a fair connection game if the graph is an extension parallel graph then there is always a strong equilibrium, and we show an example of a series parallel graph that does not have a strong equilibrium. As far as we know, we are the first to provide a topological characterization for equilibrium existence in multi-commodity and single-source network games. For any fair connection game we show that if there exists a strong equilibrium it is at most a factor of Θ(log n) from the optimal solution, where n is the number of players. This should be contrasted with the Θ(n) bound that exists for the price of anarchy [2]. For single source general connection games, we show that any series parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium, and we show an example of a graph that does not have a strong equilibrium. In this case we also show that any strong equilibrium is optimal. Related work Topological characterizations for single-commodity network games have been recently provided for various equilibrium properties, including equilibrium existence [12, 7, 8], equilibrium uniqueness [10] and equilibrium efficiency [17, 11]. The existence of pure Nash equilibrium in single-commodity network congestion games with player-specific costs or weights was studied in [12]. The existence of strong equilibrium was studied in both utility-decreasing (e.g., routing) and utility-increasing (e.g., fair cost-sharing) congestion games. [7, 8] have provided a full topological characterization for a SE existence in single-commodity utility-decreasing congestion games, and showed that a SE always exists if and only if the underlying graph is extension-parallel. [19] have shown that in single-commodity utility-increasing congestion games, the topological characterization is essentially equivalent to parallel links. In addition, they have shown that these results hold for correlated strong equilibria as well (in contrast to the decreasing setting, where correlated strong equilibria might not exist at all). While the fair cost sharing games we study are utility increasing network congestion games, we derive a different characterization than [19] due to the different assumptions regarding the players actions.3 2. MODEL 2.1 Game Theory definitions A game Λ =< N, (Σi), (ci) > has a finite set N = {1, . . . , n} of players. Player i ∈ N has a set Σi of actions, the joint action set is Σ = Σ1 × · · · × Σn and a joint action S ∈ Σ is also called a profile. The cost function of player i is 3 In [19] they allow to restrict some players from using certain links, even though the links exist in the graph, while we do not allow this, and assume that the available strategies for players are fully represented by the underlying graph. 85 ci : Σ → R+ , which maps the joint action S ∈ Σ to a non-negative real number. Let S = (S1, . . . , Sn) denote the profile of actions taken by the players, and let S−i = (S1, . . . , Si−1, Si+1, . . . , Sn) denote the profile of actions taken by all players other than player i. Note that S = (Si, S−i). The social cost of a game Λ is the sum of the costs of the players, and we denote by OPT(Λ) the minimal social cost of a game Λ. i.e., OPT(Λ) = minS∈Σ costΛ(S), where costΛ(S) = i∈N ci(S). A joint action S ∈ Σ is a pure Nash equilibrium if no player i ∈ N can benefit from unilaterally deviating from his action to another action, i.e., ∀i ∈ N ∀Si ∈ Σi : ci(S−i, Si) ≥ ci(S). We denote by NE(Λ) the set of pure Nash equilibria in the game Λ. Resilience to coalitions: A pure deviation of a set of players Γ ⊂ N (also called coalition) specifies an action for each player in the coalition, i.e., γ ∈ ×i∈ΓΣi. A joint action S ∈ Σ is not resilient to a pure deviation of a coalition Γ if there is a pure joint action γ of Γ such that ci(S−Γ, γ) < ci(S) for every i ∈ Γ (i.e., the players in the coalition can deviate in such a way that each player in the coalition reduces its cost). A pure Nash equilibrium S ∈ Σ is a k-strong equilibrium, if there is no coalition Γ of size at most k, such that S is not resilient to a pure deviation by Γ. We denote by k-SE(Λ) the set of k-strong equilibria in the game Λ. We denote by SE(Λ) the set of n-strong equilibria, and call S ∈ SE(Λ) a strong equilibrium (SE). Next we define the Price of Anarchy [9], Price of Stability [2], and their extension to Strong Price of Anarchy and Strong Price of Stability. of anarchy (k-SPoA) for the game Λ. The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is the ratio between the maximal cost of a pure Nash equilibrium (assuming one exists) and the social optimum, i.e., maxS∈NE(Λ) costΛ(S) /OPT(Λ). Similarly, the Price of Stability (PoS) is the ratio between the minimal cost of a pure Nash equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e., minS∈NE(Λ) costΛ(S)/OPT(Λ). The k-Strong Price of Anarchy (k-SPoA) is the ratio between the maximal cost of a k-strong equilibrium (assuming one exists) and the social optimum, i.e., maxS∈k-SE(Λ) costΛ(S) /OPT(Λ). The SPoA is the n-SPoA. Similarly, the Strong Price of Stability (SPoS) is the ratio between the minimal cost of a pure strong equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e., minS∈SE(Λ) costΛ(S)/OPT(Λ). Note that both k-SPoA and SPoS are defined only if some strong equilibrium exists. 2.2 Cost Sharing Connection Games A cost sharing connection game has an underlying directed graph G = (V, E) where each edge e ∈ E has an associated cost ce ≥ 04 . In a connection game each player i ∈ N has an associated source si and sink ti. In a fair connection game the actions Σi of player i include all the paths from si to ti. The cost of each edge is shared equally by the set of all players whose paths contain it. Given a joint action, the cost of a player is the sum of his costs on the edges it selected. More formally, the cost function of each player on an edge e, in a joint action S, is fe(ne(S)) = ce ne(S) , where ne(S) is the number of players that selected a path containing edge e in S. The cost of player i, when selecting path Qi ∈ Σi is ci(S) = e∈Qi fe(ne(S)). 4 In some of the existence proofs, we assume that ce > 0 for simplicity. The full version contains the complete proofs for the case ce ≥ 0. In a general connection game the actions Σi of player i is a payment vector pi, where pi(e) is how much player i is offering to contribute to the cost of edge e.5 Given a profile p, any edge e such that i pi(e) ≥ ce is considered bought, and Ep denotes the set of bought edges. Let Gp = (V, Ep) denote the graph bought by the players for profile p = (p1, . . . , pn). Clearly, each player tries to minimize his total payment which is ci(p) = e∈Ep pi(e) if si is connected to ti in Gp, and infinity otherwise.6 We denote by c(p) = i ci(p) the total cost under the profile p. For a subgraph H of G we denote the total cost of the edges in H by c(H). A symmetric connection game implies that the source and sink of all the players are identical. (We also call a symmetric connection game a single source single sink connection game, or a single commodity connection game.) A single source connection game implies that the sources of all the players are identical. Finally, A multi commodity connection game implies that each player has its own source and sink. 2.3 Extension Parallel and Series Parallel Directed Graphs Our directed graphs would be acyclic, and would have a source node (from which all nodes are reachable) and a sink node (which every node can reach). We first define the following actions for composition of directed graphs. • Identification: The identification operation allows to collapse two nodes to one. More formally, given graph G = (V, E) we define the identification of a node v1 ∈ V and v2 ∈ V forming a new node v ∈ V as creating a new graph G = (V , E ), where V = V −{v1, v2}∪{v} and E includes the edges of E where the edges of v1 and v2 are now connected to v. • Parallel composition: Given two directed graphs, G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2), with sources s1 ∈ V1 and s2 ∈ V2 and sinks t1 ∈ V1 and t2 ∈ V2, respectively, we define a new graph G = G1||G2 as follows. Let G = (V1 ∪ V2, E1 ∪ E2) be the union graph. To create G = G1||G2 we identify the sources s1 and s2, forming a new source node s, and identify the sinks t1 and t2, forming a new sink t. • Series composition: Given two directed graphs, G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2), with sources s1 ∈ V1 and s2 ∈ V2 and sinks t1 ∈ V1 and t2 ∈ V2, respectively, we define a new graph G = G1 → G2 as follows. Let G = (V1 ∪ V2, E1 ∪ E2) be the union graph. To create G = G1 → G2 we identify the vertices t1 and s2, forming a new vertex u. The graph G has a source s = s1 and a sink t = t2. • Extension composition : A series composition when one of the graphs, G1 or G2, is composed of a single directed edge is an extension composition, and we denote it by G = G1 →e G2. An extension parallel graph (EPG) is a graph G consisting of either: (1) a single directed edge (s, t), (2) a graph G = G1||G2 or (3) a graph G = G1 →e G2, where G1 and G2 are 5 We limit the players to select a path connecting si to ti and payment only on those edges. 6 This implies that in equilibrium every player has its sink and source connected by a path in Gp. 86 extension parallel graphs (and in the extension composition either G1 or G2 is a single edge.). A series parallel graph (SPG) is a graph G consisting of either: (1) a single directed edge (s, t), (2) a graph G = G1||G2 or (3) a graph G = G1 → G2, where G1 and G2 are series parallel graphs. Given a path Q and two vertices u, v on Q, we denote the subpath of Q from u to v by Qu,v. The following lemma, whose proof appears in the full version, would be the main topological tool in the case of single source graph. Lemma 2.1. Let G be an SPG with source s and sink t. Given a path Q, from s to t, and a vertex t , there exist a vertex y ∈ Q, such that for any path Q from s to t , the path Q contains y and the paths Qy,t and Q are edge disjoint. (We call the vertex y the intersecting vertex of Q and t .) 3. FAIR CONNECTION GAMES This section derives our results for fair connection games. 3.1 Existence of Strong Equilibrium While it is known that every fair connection game possesses a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies [2], this is not necessarily the case for a strong equilibrium. In this section, we study the existence of strong equilibrium in fair connection games. We begin with a simple case, showing that every symmetric fair connection game possesses a strong equilibrium. Theorem 3.1. In every symmetric fair connection game there exists a strong equilibrium. Proof. Let s be the source and t be the sink of all the players. We show that a profile S in which all the players choose the same shortest path Q (from the source s to the sink t ) is a strong equilibrium. Suppose by contradiction that S is not a SE. Then there is a coalition Γ that can deviate to a new profile S such that the cost of every player j ∈ Γ decreases. Let Qj be a new path used by player j ∈ Γ. Since Q is a shortest path, it holds that c(Qj \\ (Q ∩ Qj)) ≥ c(Q \\ (Q ∩ Qj)), for any path Qj. Therefore for every player j ∈ Γ we have that cj(S ) ≥ cj(S). However, this contradicts the fact that all players in Γ reduce their cost. (In fact, no player in Γ has reduced its cost.) While every symmetric fair connection game admits a SE, it does not hold for every fair connection game. In what follows, we study the network topologies that admit a strong equilibrium for any assignment of edge costs, and give examples of topologies for which a strong equilibrium does not exist. The following lemma, whose proof appears in the full version, plays a major role in our proofs of the existence of SE. Lemma 3.2. Let Λ be a fair connection game on a series parallel graph G with source s and sink t. Assume that player i has si = s and ti = t and that Λ has some SE. Let S be a SE that minimizes the cost of player i (out of all SE), i.e., ci(S) = minT ∈SE(Λ) ci(T) and let S∗ be the profile that minimizes the cost of player i (out of all possible profiles), i.e., ci(S∗ ) = minT ∈Σ ci(T). Then, ci(S) = ci(S∗ ). The next lemma considers parallel composition. Lemma 3.3. Let Λ be a fair connection game on graph G = G1||G2, where G1 and G2 are series parallel graphs. If every fair connection game on the graphs G1 and G2 possesses a strong equilibrium, then the game Λ possesses a strong equilibrium. Proof. Let G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) have sources s1 and s2 and sinks t1 and t2, respectively. Let Ti be the set of players with an endpoint in Vi \\ {s, t}, for i ∈ {1, 2}. (An endpoint is either a source or a sink of a player). Let T3 be the set of players j such that sj = s and tj = t. Let Λ1 and Λ2 be the original game on the respective graphs G1 and G2 with players T1 ∪ T3 and T2 ∪ T3, respectively. Let S and S be the SE in Λ1 and Λ2 that minimizes the cost of players in T3, respectively. Assume w.l.o.g. that ci(S ) ≤ ci(S ) where player i ∈ T3. In addition, let Λ2 be the game on the graph G2 with players T2 and let ¯S be a SE in Λ2. We will show that the profile S = S ∪ ¯S is a SE in Λ. Suppose by contradiction that S is not a SE. Then, there is a coalition Γ that can deviate such that the cost of every player j ∈ Γ decreases. By Lemma 3.2 and the assumption that ci(S ) ≤ ci(S ), a player j ∈ T3 cannot improve his cost. Therefore, Γ ⊆ T1 ∪ T2. But this is a contradiction to S being a SE in Λ1 or ¯S being a SE in Λ2. The following theorem considers the case of single source fair connection games. Theorem 3.4. Every single source fair connection game on a series-parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium. Proof. We prove the theorem by induction on the network size |V |. The claim obviously holds if |V | = 2. We show the claim for a series composition, i.e., G = G1 → G2, and for a parallel composition, i.e., G = G1||G2, where G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) are SPGs with sources s1, s2, and sinks t1, t2, respectively. series composition. Let G = G1 → G2. Let T1 be the set of players j such that tj ∈ V1, and T2 be the set of players j such that tj ∈ V2 \\ {s2}. Let Λ1 and Λ2 be the original game on the respective graphs G1 and G2 with players T1 ∪ T2 and T2, respectively. For every player i ∈ T2 with action Si in the game Λ let Si ∩E1 be his induced action in the game Λ1, and let Si ∩E2 be his induced action in the game Λ2. Let S be a SE in Λ1 that minimizes the cost of players in T2 (such a SE exists by the induction hypothesis and Lemma 3.2). Let S be any SE in Λ2. We will show that the profile S = S ∪ S is a SE in the game Λ, i.e., for player j ∈ T2 we use the profile Sj = Sj ∪ Sj . Suppose by contradiction that S is not a SE. Then, there is a coalition Γ that can deviate such that the cost of every player j ∈ Γ decreases. Now, there are two cases: Case 1: Γ ⊆ T1. This is a contradiction to S being a SE. Case 2: There exists a player j ∈ Γ ∩ T2. By Lemma 3.2, player j cannot improve his cost in Λ1 so the improvement is due to Λ2. Consider the coalition Γ ∩ T2, it would still improve its cost. However, this contradicts the fact that S is a SE in Λ2. parallel composition. Follows from Lemma 3.3. While multi-commodity fair connection games on series parallel graphs do not necessarily possess a SE (see Theorem 3.6), fair connection games on extension parallel graphs always possess a strong equilibrium. Theorem 3.5. Every fair connection game on an extension parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium. 87 t2 t1 s1 s2 2 2 1 3 3 1 (b)(a) a b e f c d Figure 1: Graph topologies. Proof. We prove the theorem by induction on the network size |V |. Let Λ be a fair connection game on an EPG G = (V, E). The claim obviously holds if |V | = 2. If the graph G is a parallel composition of two EPG graphs G1 and G2, then the claim follows from Lemma 3.3. It remains to prove the claim for extension composition. Suppose the graph G is an extension composition of the graph G1 consisting of a single edge e = (s1, t1) and an EPG G2 = (V2, E2) with terminals s2, t2, such that s = s1 and t = t2. (The case that G2 is a single edge is similar.) Let T1 be the set of players with source s1 and sink t1 (i.e., their path is in G1). Let T2 be the set of players with source and sink in G2. Let T3 be the set of players with source s1 and sink in V2 \\ t1. Let Λ1 and Λ2 be the original game on the respective graphs G1 and G2 with players T1 ∪ T3 and T2 ∪ T3, respectively. Let S , S be SE in Λ1 and Λ2 respectively. We will show that the profile S = S ∪ S is a SE in the game Λ. Suppose by contradiction that S is not a SE. Then, there is a coalition Γ of minimal size that can deviate such that the cost of any player j ∈ Γ decreases. Clearly, T1 ∩Γ = φ, since players in T1 have a single strategy. Hence, Γ ⊆ T2 ∪T3. Any player j ∈ T2 ∪T3 cannot improve his cost in Λ1. Therefore, any player j ∈ T2 ∪ T3 improves his cost in Λ2. However, this contradicts the fact that S is a SE in Λ2. In the following theorem we provide a few examples of topologies in which a strong equilibrium does not exist, showing that our characterization is almost tight. Theorem 3.6. The following connection games exist: (1) There exists a multi-commodity fair connection game on a series parallel graph that does not possess a strong equilibrium. (2) There exists a single source fair connection game that does not possess a strong equilibrium. Proof. For claim (1) consider the graph depicted in Figure 1(a). This game has a unique NE where S1 = {e, c}, S2 = {b, f}, and each player has a cost of 5.7 However, consider the following coordinated deviation S . S1 = {a, b, c}, 7 In any NE of the game, player 1 will buy the edge e and player 2 will buy the edge f. This is since the alternate path, in the respective part, will cost the player 2.5. Thus, player 1 (player 2) will buy the edge c (edge b) alone, and each player will have a cost of 5. s 2 + 2 2 1 − 2 1 + 3 1 2 − 3 1 1 1 2 − 3 t1 t2 a c d e f h g b Figure 2: Example of a single source connection game that does not admit SE. and S2 = {b, c, d}. In this profile, each player pays a cost of 4, and thus improves its cost. For claim (2) consider a single source fair connection game on the graph G depicted in Figure 2. There are two players. Player i = 1, 2 wishes to connect the source s to its sink ti and the unique NE is S1 = {a, b}, S2 = {a, c}, and each player has a cost of 2. 8 Then, both players can deviate to S1 = {h, f, d} and S2 = {h, f, e}, and decrease their costs to 2 − /2. Unfortunately, our characterization is not completely tight. The graph in Figure 1(b) is an example of a non-extension parallel graph which always admits a strong equilibrium. 3.2 Strong Price of Anarchy While the price of anarchy in fair connection games can be as bad as n, the following theorem shows that the strong price of anarchy is bounded by H(n) = n i=1 1 i = Θ(log n). Theorem 3.7. The strong price of anarchy of a fair connection game with n players is at most H(n). Proof. Let Λ be a fair connection game on the graph G. We denote by Λ(Γ) the game played on the graph G by a set of players Γ, where the action of player i ∈ Γ remains Σi (the same as in Λ). Let S = (S1, . . . , Sn) be a profile in the game Λ. We denote by S(Γ) = SΓ the induced profile of players in Γ in the game Λ(Γ). Let ne(S(Γ)) denote the load of edge e under the profile S(Γ) in the game Λ(Γ), i.e., ne(S(Γ)) = |{j|j ∈ Γ, e ∈ Sj}|. Similar to congestion games [16, 13] we denote by Φ(S(Γ)) the potential function of the profile S(Γ) in the game Λ(Γ), where Φ(S(Γ)) = e∈E ne(S(Γ)) j=1 fe(j), and define Φ(S(φ)) = 0. In our case, it holds that Φ(S) = e∈E ce · H(ne(S)). (1) Let S be a SE, and let S∗ be the profile of the optimal solution. We define an order on the players as follows. Let Γn = {1, ..., n} be the set of all the players. For each k = 8 We can show that this is the unique NE by a simple case analysis: (i) If S1 = {h, f, d} and S2 = {h, f, e}, then player 1 can deviate to S1 = {h, g} and decrease his cost. (ii) If S1 = {h, g} and S2 = {h, f, e}, then player 2 can deviate to S2 = {a, c} and decrease his cost. (iii) If S1 = {h, g} and S2 = {a, c}, then player 1 can deviate to S1 = {a, b} and decrease his cost. 88 n, . . . , 1, since S is a SE, there exists a player in Γk, w.l.o.g. call it player k, such that, ck(S) ≤ ck(S−Γk , S∗ Γk ). (2) In this way, Γk is defined recursively, such that for every k = n, . . . , 2 it holds that Γk−1 = Γk \\ {k}. (I.e., after the renaming, Γk = {1, . . . , k}.) Let ck(S(Γk)) denote the cost of player k in the game Λ(Γk) under the induced profile S(Γk). It is easy to see that ck(S(Γk)) = Φ(S(Γk)) − Φ(S(Γk−1)).9 Therefore, ck(S) ≤ ck(S−Γk , S∗ Γk ) (3) ≤ ck(S∗ (Γk)) = Φ(S∗ (Γk)) − Φ(S∗ (Γk−1)). Summing over all players, we obtain: i∈N ci(S) ≤ Φ(S∗ (Γn)) − Φ(S∗ (φ)) = Φ(S∗ (Γn)) = e∈S∗ ce · H(ne(S∗ )) ≤ e∈S∗ ce · H(n) = H(n) · OPT(Λ), where the first inequality follows since the sum of the right hand side of equation (3) telescopes, and the second equality follows from equation (1). Next we bound the SPoA when coalitions of size at most k are allowed. Theorem 3.8. The k-SPoA of a fair connection game with n players is at most n k · H(k). Proof. Let S be a SE of Λ, and S∗ be the profile of the optimal solution of Λ. To simplify the proof, we assume that n/k is an integer. We partition the players to n/k groups T1, . . . , Tn/k each of size k. Let Λj be the game on the graph G played by the set of players Tj. Let S(Tj) denote the profile of the k players in Tj in the game Λj induced by the profile S of the game Λ. By Theorem 3.7, it holds that for each game Λj, j = 1, . . . , n/k, costΛj (S(Tj)) = i∈Tj ci(S(Tj)) ≤ H(k) · OPT(Λj) ≤ H(k) · OPT(Λ). Summing over all games Λj, j = 1, . . . , n/k, costΛ(S) ≤ n/k j=1 costΛj (S(Tj)) ≤ n k · H(k) · OPT(Λ), where the first inequality follows since for each group Tj and player i ∈ Tj, it holds that ci(S) ≤ ci(S(Tj)). Next we show an almost matching lower bound. (The lower bound is at most H(n) = O(log n) from the upper bound and both for k = O(1) and k = Ω(n) the difference is only a constant.) Theorem 3.9. For fair connection games with n players, k-SPoA ≥ max{n k , H(n)}. 9 This follows since for any strategy profile S, if a single player k deviates to strategy Sk, then the change in the potential value Φ(S) − Φ(Sk, S−k) is exactly the change in the cost to player k. t2 s t1 tn−2 tn 1 2 t3 tn−1 1 1 3 1 n−2 2 n 1 + 00 0 0 0 00 0 Figure 3: Example of a network topology in which SPoS > PoS. Proof. For the lower bound of H(n) we observe that in the example presented in [2], the unique Nash equilibrium is also a strong equilibrium, and therefore k-SPoA = H(n) for any 1 ≤ k ≤ n. For the lower bound of n/k, consider a graph composed of two parallel links of costs 1 and n/k. Consider the profile S in which all n players use the link of cost n/k. The cost of each player is 1/k, while if any coalition of size at most k deviates to the link of cost 1, the cost of each player is at least 1/k. Therefore, the profile S is a k-SE, and k-SPoA = n/k. The results of Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 can be extended to concave cost functions. Consider the extended fair connection game, where each edge has a cost which depends on the number of players using that edge, ce(ne). We assume that the cost function ce(ne) is a nondecreasing, concave function. Note that the cost of an edge ce(ne) might increase with the number of players using it, but the cost per player fe(ne) = ce(ne)/ne decreases when ce(ne) is concave. Theorem 3.10. The strong price of anarchy of a fair connection game with nondecreasing concave edge cost functions and n players is at most H(n). Proof. The proof is analogues to the proof of Theorem 3.7. For the proof we show that cost(S) ≤ Φ(S∗ ) ≤ H(n)·cost(S∗ ). We first show the first inequality. Since the function ce(x) is concave, the cost per player ce(x)/x is a nonincreasing function. Therefore inequality (3) in the proof of Theorem 3.7 holds. Summing inequality (3) over all players we obtain cost(S) = i ci(S) ≤ Φ(S∗ (Γn))−Φ(S∗ (φ)) = Φ(S∗ ). The second inequality follows since ce(x) is nondecreasing and therefore ne x=1(ce(x)/x) ≤ H(ne) · ce(ne). Using the arguments in the proof of Theorem 3.10 and the proof of Theorem 3.8 we derive, Theorem 3.11. The k-SPoA of a fair connection game with nondecreasing concave edge cost functions and n players is at most n k · H(k). Since the set of strong equilibria is contained in the set of Nash equilibria, it must hold that SPoA ≤ PoA, meaning that the SPoA can only be improved compared to the PoA. However, with respect to the price of stability the opposite direction holds, that is, SPoS ≥ PoS. We next show that there exists a fair connection game in which the inequality is strict. 89 2 − 2 − 2 − 3 s t1 t2 t3 Figure 4: Example of a single source general connection game that does not admit a strong equilibrium. The edges that are not labeled with costs have a cost of zero. Theorem 3.12. There exists a fair connection game in which SPoS > PoS. Proof. Consider a single source fair connection game on the graph G depicted in Figure 3.10 Player i = 1, . . . , n wishes to connect the source s to his sink ti. Assume that each player i = 1, . . . , n − 2 has his own path of cost 1/i from s to ti and players i = n − 1, n have a joint path of cost 2/n from s to ti. Additionally, all players can share a common path of cost 1+ for some small > 0. The optimal solution connects all players through the common path of cost 1 + , and this is also a Nash equilibrium with total cost 1 + . It is easy to verify that the solution where each player i = 1, . . . , n−2 uses his own path and users i = n−1, n use their joint path is the unique strong equilibrium of this game with total cost n−2 i=1 1 i + 2 n = Θ(log n) While the example above shows that the SPoS may be greater than the PoS, the upper bound of H(n) = Θ(log n), proven for the PoS [2], serves as an upper bound for the SPoS as well. This is a direct corollary from theorem 3.7, as SPoS ≤ SPoA by definition. Corollary 3.13. The strong price of stability of a fair connection game with n players is at most H(n) = O(log n). 4. GENERAL CONNECTION GAMES In this section, we derive our results for general connection games. 4.1 Existence of Strong Equilibrium We begin with a characterization of the existence of a strong equilibrium in symmetric general connection games. Similar to Theorem 3.1 (using a similar proof) we establish, Theorem 4.1. In every symmetric fair connection game there exists a strong equilibrium. While every single source general connection game possesses a pure Nash equilibrium [3], it does not necessarily admit some strong equilibrium.11 10 This is a variation on the example given in [2]. 11 We thank Elliot Anshelevich, whose similar topology for the fair-connection game inspired this example. Theorem 4.2. There exists a single source general connection game that does not admit any strong equilibrium. Proof. Consider single source general connection game with 3 players on the graph depicted in Figure 4. Player i wishes to connect the source s with its sink ti.We need to consider only the NE profiles: (i) if all three players use the link of cost 3, then there must be two agents whose total sum exceeds 2, thus they can both reduce cost by deviating to an edge of cost 2− . (ii) if two of the players use an edge of cost 2− jointly, and the third player uses a different edge of cost 2 − , then, the players with non-zero payments can deviate to the path with the edge of cost 3 and reduce their costs (since before the deviation the total payments of the players is 4 − 2 ). We showed that none of the NE are SE, and thus the game does not possess any SE. Next we show that for the class of series parallel graphs, there is always a strong equilibrium in the case of a single source. Theorem 4.3. In every single source general connection game on a series-parallel graph, there exists a strong equilibrium. Proof. Let Λ be a single source general connection game on a SPG G = (V, E) with source s and sink t. We present an algorithm that constructs a specific SE. We first consider the following partial order between the players. For players i and j, we have that i → j if there is a directed path from ti to tj. We complete the partial order to a full order (in an arbitrary way), and w.l.o.g. we assume that 1 → 2 → · · · → n. The algorithm COMPUTE-SE, considers the players in an increasing order, starting with player 1. Each player i will fully buy a subset of the edges, and any player j > i will consider the cost of those (bought) edges as zero. When COMPUTE-SE considers player j, the cost of the edges that players 1 to j−1 have bought is set to zero, and player j fully buys a shortest path Qj from s to tj. Namely, for every edges e ∈ Qj \\ ∪i<jQi we have pj(e) = ce and otherwise pj(e) = 0. We next show that the algorithm COMPUTESE computes a SE. Assume by way of contradiction that the profile p is not a SE. Then, there exists a coalition that can improve the costs of all its players by a deviation. Let Γ be such a coalition of minimal size and let player i = max{j ∈ Γ}. For a player j ∈ Γ let ¯Qj and ¯pj be the path and payment of player j after the deviation, respectively. Let Q be a path from the sink of player i, i.e. ti, to the sink of G, i.e. t. Then Q = ¯Qi ∪ Q is a path from the source s to the sink t. For any player j < i, let yj be the intersecting vertex of Q and tj (by Lemma 2.1 one is guarantee to exist). Let y be the furthest vertex on the path Q such that y = yj for some j < i. The path from the source s to node y was fully paid for by players j < i in p (before the deviation). There are two cases we consider. case a: After the deviation player i does not pay for edges in j∈Γ\\{i} ¯Qj . This is a contradiction to the minimality of the coalition Γ size, since the players in Γ \\ {i} can form a smaller coalition with payments ¯p. case b: Otherwise, we show that player i cost after the deviation, i.e. ci(¯p), is at least his cost before the deviation, i.e. ci(p), contradicting the fact that player i improved his cost. Recall that given two vertices u, v on path ¯Q we denote by ¯Qu,v the subpath of ¯Q from u to v. 90 Before the deviation of the coalition Γ, a path from s to y was fully paid for by the players j < i. Next we show that no player k > i pays for any edge on any path from s to ti. Consider a player k > i and let Qk = Qk ∪ Qk , where Qk is a path connecting tk to t. Let yk be the intersecting vertex of Qk and ti. Since there exists a path from s to yk that was fully paid for by players j < k before the deviation, in particularly the path Qi s,yk , player k will not pay for any edge on any path connecting s and yk. Therefore player i fully pays for all edges on the path ¯Qi y,ti , i.e., ¯pi(e) = ce for all edges e ∈ ¯Qi y,ti . Now consider the algorithm COMPUTESE at the step when player i selects a shortest path from the source s to its sink ti and determines his payment pi. At this point, player i could buy the path ¯Qi y,ti , since a path from s to y was already paid for by players j < i. Hence, ci(¯p) ≥ ci(p). This contradicts the fact that player i improved its cost and therefore not all the players in Γ reduce their cost. This implies that p is a strong equilibrium. 4.2 Strong Price of Anarchy While for every single source general connection game, it holds that PoS = 1 [3], the price of anarchy can be as large as n, even for two parallel edges. Here, we show that any strong equilibrium in single source general connection games yields the optimal cost. Theorem 4.4. In single source general connection game, if there exists a strong equilibrium, then the strong price of anarchy is 1. Proof. Let p = (p1, . . . , pn) be a strong equilibrium, and let T∗ be the minimum cost Steiner tree on all players, rooted at the (single) source s. Let T∗ e be the subtree of T∗ disconnected from s when edge e is removed. Let Γ(Te) be the set of players which have sinks in Te. For a set of edges E, let c(E) = e∈E ce. Let P(Te) = i∈Γ(Te) ci(p). Assume by way of contradiction that c(p) > c(T∗ ). We will show that there exists a sub-tree T of T∗ , that connects a subset of players Γ ⊆ N, and a new set of payments ¯p, such that for each i ∈ Γ, ci(¯p) < ci(p). This will contradict the assumption that p is a strong equilibrium. First we show how to find a sub-tree T of T∗ , such that for any edge e, the payments of players with sinks in T∗ e is more than the cost of T∗ e ∪ {e}. To build T , define an edge e to be bad if the cost of T∗ e ∪ {e} is at least the payments of the players with sinks in T∗ e , i.e., c(T∗ e ∪ {e}) ≥ P(T∗ e ). Let B be the set of bad edges. We define T to be T∗ − ∪e∈B(T∗ e ∪ {e}). Note that we can find a subset B of B such that ∪e∈B(T∗ e ∪ {e}) is equal to ∪e∈B (T∗ e ∪ {e}) and for any e1, e2 ∈ B we have T∗ e1 ∩ T∗ e2 = ∅. (The set B will include any edge e ∈ B for which there is no other edge e ∈ B on the path from e to the source s.) Considering the edges in e ∈ B we can see that any subtree T∗ e we delete from T can not decrease the difference between the payments and the cost of the remaining tree. Therefore, in T for every edge e, we have that c(Te ∪ {e}) < P(Te). Now we have a tree T and our coalition will be Γ(T ). What remain is to find payments ¯p for the players in Γ(T ) such that they will buy the tree T and every player in Γ(T ) will lower its cost, i.e. ci(p) > ci(¯p) for i ∈ Γ(T ). (Recall that the payments have the restriction that player i can only pay for edges on the path from s to ti.) We will now define the coalition payments ¯p. Let ci(¯p, Te) = e∈Te ¯pi(e) be the payments of player i for the subtree Te. We will show that for every subtree Te, ci(¯p, Te ∪ {e}) < ci(p), and hence ci(¯p) < ci(p). Consider the following bottom up process that defines ¯p. We assign the payments of edge e in T , after we assign payments to all the edges in Te. This implies that when we assign payments for e, we have that the sum of the payments in Te is equal to c(Te) = i∈Γ(Te) ci(¯p, Te). Since e was not a bad edge, we know that c(Te ∪ {e}) = c(Te) + ce < P(Te). Therefore, we can update the payments ¯p of players i ∈ Γ(Te), by setting ¯pi(e) = ce∆i/( j∈Γ(Te) ∆j), where ∆j = cj(p) − cj(¯p, Te). After the update we have for player i ∈ Γ(Te), ci(¯p, Te ∪ {e}) = ci(¯p, Te) + ¯pi(e) = ci(¯p, Te) + ∆i ce j∈Γ(Te) ∆j = ci(p) − ∆i(1 − ce P(Γ(Te)) − c(Te) ), where we used the fact that j∈Γ(Te) ∆j = P(Γ(Te))−c(Te). Since ce < P(Γ(Te)) − c(Te) it follows that ci(¯p, Te ∪ {e}) < ci(p). 5. REFERENCES [1] N. Andelman, M. Feldman, and Y. Mansour. Strong Price of Anarchy. In SODA07, 2007. [2] E. Anshelevich, A.

Introducción La teoría del juego computacional ha introducido el tema de los incentivos a muchos de los problemas clásicos de optimización combinatoria. La opinión de que el lado de la demanda no está muchas veces bajo el control de una autoridad central que optimiza el rendimiento global, sino que bajo el control de individuos con diferentes incentivos, ya ha llevado a muchas ideas importantes. Considere problemas clásicos de enrutamiento y transporte, como problemas de multidifusión o múltiples productos básicos, que se ven muchas veces de la siguiente manera. Se nos da un gráfico con costos de borde y demandas de conectividad entre los nodos, y nuestro objetivo es encontrar una solución de costo mínimo. El enfoque centralizado clásico supone que todas las demandas individuales pueden coordinarse completamente y no tener incentivos individuales. El punto de vista de la teoría del juego supondría que cada demanda individual está controlada por un jugador que optimiza su propia utilidad, y el resultado resultante podría estar lejos de la solución óptima. Al considerar los incentivos individuales, uno necesita discutir el concepto de solución apropiado. Gran parte de la investigación en la teoría de los juegos computacionales se ha centrado en el equilibrio clásico de Nash como el concepto de solución principal. De hecho, el equilibrio de Nash tiene muchos beneficios, y lo más importante es que siempre existe (en estrategias mixtas). Sin embargo, el concepto de solución del equilibrio de Nash es resistente solo a las desviaciones unilaterales, mientras que en realidad, los jugadores pueden coordinar sus acciones. Un fuerte equilibrio [4] es un estado desde el cual ninguna coalición (de cualquier tamaño) puede desviarse y mejorar la utilidad de cada miembro de la coalición (al tiempo que baja la utilidad 84 de jugadores fuera de la coalición). Esta resistencia a las desviaciones de las coaliciones de los jugadores es muy atractiva, y uno puede esperar que una vez que se alcance un fuerte equilibrio, es muy probable que se mantenga. Desde el punto de vista de la teoría del juego computacional, un beneficio adicional de un fuerte equilibrio es que tiene el potencial de reducir la distancia entre la solución óptima y la solución obtenida como resultado del comportamiento egoísta. El fuerte precio de la anarquía (SPOA), introducido en [1], es la relación entre el costo del peor equilibrio fuerte y el costo de una solución óptima. Obviamente, SPOA es significativo solo en aquellos casos en los que existe un fuerte equilibrio. Una desventaja importante del fuerte equilibrio es que la mayoría de los juegos no admiten ningún equilibrio fuerte. Incluso los juegos clásicos simples como el dilema de los prisioneros no poseen ningún equilibrio fuerte (que también es un ejemplo de un juego de congestión que no posee un fuerte equilibrio 1). Este hecho desafortunado ha reducido la concentración en un equilibrio fuerte, a pesar de sus propiedades altamente atractivas. Sin embargo, [1] han identificado dos familias amplias de juegos, a saber, la programación de empleo y la formación de redes, donde siempre existe un fuerte equilibrio y el SPOA es significativamente más bajo que el precio de la anarquía (que es la relación entre el peor equilibrio de Nash y el óptimosolución [15, 18, 5, 6]). En este trabajo nos concentramos en los juegos de conexión de costos compartidos, introducidos por [3, 2]. En tal juego, hay un gráfico dirigido subyacente con costos de borde, y los usuarios individuales tienen demandas de conectividad (entre una fuente y un fregadero). Consideramos dos modelos. El modelo de conexión de costo justo [2] permite a cada jugador seleccionar una ruta desde la fuente hasta el fregadero2. En este juego, el costo de una ventaja se comparte por igual entre todos los jugadores que seleccionaron el borde, y el costo del jugador es la suma de sus costos en los bordes que seleccionó. El juego de conexión general [3] permite a cada jugador ofrecer precios para los bordes. En este juego se compra una ventaja si la suma de las ofertas al menos cubre su costo, y el costo del jugador es la suma de sus ofertas en los bordes comprados (en ambos juegos suponemos que el jugador tiene que garantizar la conectividad entresu fuente y fregadero). En este trabajo nos centramos en dos temas importantes. El primero es identificar en qué condiciones se garantiza la existencia de un fuerte equilibrio, y el segundo es la calidad de los equilibrios fuertes. Para la parte de la existencia, identificamos familias de topologías gráficas que poseen un fuerte equilibrio para cualquier asignación de costos de borde. Uno puede ver esta separación entre la topología gráfica y los costos de borde, como una separación entre la infraestructura subyacente y los costos que los jugadores observan comprar bordes. Si bien uno espera que la infraestructura sea estable durante largos períodos de tiempo, los costos que los jugadores observan pueden modificarse fácilmente durante los períodos de tiempo cortos. Tal caracterización topológica de la infraestructura subyacente proporciona una condición topológica de diseñador de red que garantizará la estabilidad en su red. Nuestros resultados son los siguientes. Para el caso único de los productos básicos (todos los jugadores tienen la misma fuente y sumidero), hay un fuerte equilibrio en cualquier gráfico (tanto para juegos de conexión justo como general). Además, el fuerte equilibrio también es 1, mientras que se sabe que cualquier juego de congestión admite al menos un equilibrio de Nash en estrategias puras [16].2 El esquema de costo compartido también es atractivo desde el punto de vista del diseño del mecanismo, ya que es un mecanismo de intercambio de costos a prueba de estrategias [14].La solución óptima (a saber, los jugadores comparten una ruta más corta desde la fuente común hasta el sumidero común). Para el caso de una sola fuente y múltiples sumideros (por ejemplo, en un árbol de multidifusión), mostramos que en un juego de conexión justo hay un fuerte equilibrio si el gráfico subyacente es un gráfico paralelo en serie, y mostramos un ejemplo de ungráfico paralelo de no eserías que no tiene un equilibrio fuerte. Para el caso de múltiples productos básicos (fuentes y sumideros múltiples), mostramos que en un juego de conexión justo si el gráfico es un gráfico paralelo de extensión, entonces siempre hay un equilibrio fuerte, y mostramos un ejemplo de un gráfico paralelo en serie que sí sí sí.no tener un equilibrio fuerte. Hasta donde sabemos, somos los primeros en proporcionar una caracterización topológica para la existencia de equilibrio en los juegos de redes múltiples y de código único. Para cualquier juego de conexión justo, mostramos que si existe un fuerte equilibrio, es como máximo un factor de θ (log n) de la solución óptima, donde n es el número de jugadores. Esto debe contrastarse con el límite θ (n) que existe para el precio de la anarquía [2]. Para los juegos de conexión general de fuente única, mostramos que cualquier gráfico paralelo de la serie posee un equilibrio fuerte, y mostramos un ejemplo de un gráfico que no tiene un equilibrio fuerte. En este caso, también mostramos que cualquier equilibrio fuerte es óptimo. Las caracterizaciones topológicas de trabajo relacionado para los juegos de red de productos únicos se han proporcionado recientemente para varias propiedades de equilibrio, incluida la existencia de equilibrio [12, 7, 8], singularidad de equilibrio [10] y eficiencia de equilibrio [17, 11]. La existencia de equilibrio de Nash puro en juegos de congestión de la red de productos únicos con costos o pesos específicos del jugador se estudió en [12]. La existencia de un fuerte equilibrio se estudió tanto en la reducción de servicios públicos (por ejemplo, enrutamiento) como en los juegos de congestión de incrustaciones de servicios públicos (por ejemplo, costos compartidos).[7, 8] han proporcionado una caracterización topológica completa para una existencia de SE en juegos de congestión de dólar de servicios únicos, y ha demostrado que siempre existe un SE si y solo si el gráfico subyacente es paralelo de extensión.[19] han demostrado que en los juegos de congestión de los servicios públicos de un solo producto, la caracterización topológica es esencialmente equivalente a los enlaces paralelos. Además, han demostrado que estos resultados también se mantienen para equilibrios fuertes correlacionados (en contraste con la configuración decreciente, donde los equilibrios fuertes correlacionados podrían no existir en absoluto). Si bien los juegos justos de costos compartidos que estudiamos son juegos de congestión de la red que aumentan la red, obtenemos una caracterización diferente a [19] debido a los diferentes supuestos con respecto a las acciones de los jugadores.3 2. Modelo 2.1 Definiciones de la teoría del juego Un juego λ = <n, (σi), (ci)> tiene un conjunto finito n = {1 ,..., n} de los jugadores. El jugador i ∈ N tiene un conjunto σi de acciones, el conjunto de acción conjunta es σ = σ1 × · · · × σn y una acción conjunta s ∈ σ también se llama perfil. La función de costo del jugador I es 3 en [19] permiten restringir que algunos jugadores usen ciertos enlaces, a pesar de que los enlaces existen en el gráfico, mientras que no permitimos esto, y asumir que las estrategias disponibles para los jugadores están completamente representadas.por el gráfico subyacente.85 CI: σ → R+, que mapea la acción conjunta S ∈ σ a un número real no negativo. Sea s = (s1, ..., sn) denota el perfil de las acciones tomadas por los jugadores, y déje s - i = (s1, .., si - 1, si+1, .., sn) denoteEl perfil de las acciones tomadas por todos los jugadores que no sean el jugador i. Tenga en cuenta que S = (Si, S - I). El costo social de un juego λ es la suma de los costos de los jugadores, y denotamos por OPT (λ) el costo social mínimo de un juego λ.es decir, opt (λ) = mins∈σ costλ (s), donde costλ (s) = i∈N Ci (s). Una acción conjunta s ∈ σ es un equilibrio de Nash puro si ningún jugador i ∈ N puede beneficiarse de desviarse unilateralmente de su acción a otra acción, es decir, ∀i ∈ N ∀si ∈ σi: ci (S - i, Si) ≥ Ci(S). Denotamos por ne (λ) el conjunto de equilibrios puros de Nash en el juego λ. Resiliencia a las coaliciones: una desviación pura de un conjunto de jugadores γ ⊂ n (también llamado coalición) especifica una acción para cada jugador en la coalición, es decir, γ ∈ × i∈γσi. Una acción conjunta s ∈ σ no es resistente a una desviación pura de una coalición γ si hay una acción articular pura γ de γ de tal manera que CI (S - γ, γ) <Ci (s) para cada i ∈ γ (es decir,,, es decir,Los jugadores de la coalición pueden desviarse de tal manera que cada jugador en la coalición reduce su costo). Un equilibrio de Nash puro S ∈ σ es un equilibrio de K-Strong, si no hay coalición γ de tamaño en la mayoría de K, de modo que S no es resistente a una desviación pura por γ. Denotamos por K-SE (λ) el conjunto de equilibrios K-Strong en el juego λ. Denotamos por SE (λ) el conjunto de equilibrios N-Strong, y llamamos S ∈ SE (λ) un equilibrio fuerte (SE). A continuación, definimos el precio de la anarquía [9], el precio de la estabilidad [2] y su extensión al precio fuerte de la anarquía y el fuerte precio de la estabilidad.de anarquía (K-SPOA) para el juego λ. El precio de la anarquía (POA) es la relación entre el costo máximo de un equilibrio de Nash puro (suponiendo que uno existe) y el óptimo social, es decir, maxs∈Ne (λ) costλ (s) /opt (λ). Del mismo modo, el precio de la estabilidad (POS) es la relación entre el costo mínimo de un equilibrio de Nash puro y el óptimo social, es decir, mins∈Ne (λ) costλ (s)/OPT (λ). El precio K-Strong de la anarquía (K-SPOA) es la relación entre el costo máximo de un equilibrio de K-Strong (suponiendo que exista) y el óptimo social, es decir, maxs∈K-se (λ) costλ (s) / / s) /Opt (λ). El SPOA es el N-SPOA. Del mismo modo, el fuerte precio de la estabilidad (SPO) es la relación entre el costo mínimo de un equilibrio puro fuerte y el óptimo social, es decir, mins∈Se (λ) costλ (s)/opt (λ). Tenga en cuenta que tanto K-SPOA como SPO se definen solo si existe un equilibrio fuerte.2.2 Juegos de conexión de costo compartido Un juego de conexión de costo compartido tiene un gráfico dirigido subyacente G = (v, e) donde cada borde e ∈ E tiene un costo asociado CE ≥ 04. En un juego de conexión, cada jugador i ∈ N tiene una fuente asociada SI y sumidero TI. En un juego de conexión justo, las acciones σi del jugador incluyo todos los caminos de Si a Ti. El costo de cada borde es compartido por igual por el conjunto de todos los jugadores cuyos caminos lo contienen. Dada una acción conjunta, el costo de un jugador es la suma de sus costos en los bordes que seleccionó. Más formalmente, la función de costo de cada jugador en un borde E, en una acción conjunta S, es Fe (ne (s)) = ce ne (s), donde ne (s) es el número de jugadores que seleccionaron una ruta que contieneEdge E en S. El costo del Jugador I, al seleccionar la ruta qi ∈ σi es CI (S) = E∈Qi Fe (NE (S)).4 En algunas de las pruebas de existencia, suponemos que ce> 0 por simplicidad. La versión completa contiene las pruebas completas para el caso CE ≥ 0. En un juego de conexión general, las acciones σi del jugador I son un vector de pago Pi, donde Pi (E) es cuánto jugador estoy ofreciendo contribuir al costo del borde e.5 dado un perfil p, cualquier borde E de tal manera que yoPI (E) ≥ CE se considera comprado, y EP denota el conjunto de bordes comprados. Deje que GP = (V, EP) denote el gráfico comprado por los jugadores para el perfil P = (P1, ..., Pn). Claramente, cada jugador intenta minimizar su pago total que es Ci (p) = e∈EP pi (e) si Si está conectado a ti en GP, y al infinito de lo contrario.6 Denotamos por c (p) = i ci (p) El costo total bajo el perfil p.Para un subgrafio H de G denotamos el costo total de los bordes en H por C (H). Un juego de conexión simétrica implica que la fuente y el sumidero de todos los jugadores son idénticos.(También llamamos a un juego de conexión simétrica un juego de conexión de un solo sumidero de una sola fuente, o un solo juego de conexión de productos básicos). Un juego de conexión de fuente única implica que las fuentes de todos los jugadores son idénticas. Finalmente, un juego de conexión de múltiples productos básicos implica que cada jugador tiene su propia fuente y sumidero.2.3 Extensión paralela y gráficos dirigidos en paralelo en paralelo Nuestros gráficos dirigidos serían acíclicos, y tendrían un nodo fuente (desde el cual todos los nodos son accesibles) y un nodo de sumidero (que cada nodo puede alcanzar). Primero definimos las siguientes acciones para la composición de gráficos dirigidos.• Identificación: la operación de identificación permite colapsar dos nodos a uno. Más formalmente, dada la gráfica g = (v, e) definimos la identificación de un nodo v1 ∈ V y v2 ∈ V formando un nuevo nodo v ∈ V como creando un nuevo gráfico g = (v, e), donde v = v = v = v = v =- {v1, v2} ∪ {v} e e incluyen los bordes de E donde los bordes de V1 y V2 ahora están conectados a v. • Composición paralela: dados dos gráficos dirigidos, g1 = (v1, e1) y g2 = ((V2, E2), con las fuentes s1 ∈ V1 y S2 ∈ V2 y se hunde T1 ∈ V1 y T2 ∈ V2, respectivamente, definimos un nuevo gráfico G = G1 || G2 como sigue. Sea G = (V1 ∪ V2, E1 ∪ E2) el gráfico de la Unión. Para crear G = G1 || G2, identificamos las fuentes S1 y S2, formando un nuevo nodo fuente e identificamos los sumideros T1 y T2, formando un nuevo sumidero.• Composición en serie: dados dos gráficos dirigidos, G1 = (V1, E1) y G2 = (V2, E2), con las fuentes S1 ∈ V1 y S2 ∈ V2 y se hunde T1 ∈ V1 y T2 ∈ V2, respectivamente, definimos un nuevoGráfico G = G1 → G2 de la siguiente manera. Sea G = (V1 ∪ V2, E1 ∪ E2) el gráfico de la Unión. Para crear G = G1 → G2, identificamos los vértices T1 y S2, formando un nuevo vértice u. El gráfico G tiene una fuente S = S1 y un fregadero T = T2.• Composición de extensión: una composición en serie cuando uno de los gráficos, G1 o G2, está compuesto por un solo borde dirigido es una composición de extensión, y la denotamos por G = G1 → E G2. Un gráfico paralelo de extensión (EPG) es un gráfico G que consta de: (1) Un solo borde dirigido (S, T), (2) Un gráfico G = G1 || G2 o (3) Un gráfico G = G1 → EG2, donde G1 y G2 son 5, limitamos los jugadores para seleccionar una ruta que conecta SI a Ti y el pago solo en esos bordes.6 Esto implica que en equilibrio cada jugador tiene su fregadero y fuente conectados por una ruta en GP.86 Gráficos paralelos de extensión (y en la composición de extensión, G1 o G2 es un solo borde). Un gráfico paralelo en serie (SPG) es un gráfico G que consta de: (1) Un solo borde dirigido (S, T), (2) Un gráfico G = G1 || G2 o (3) Un gráfico G = G1 → G2, donde G1 y G2 son gráficos paralelos de la serie. Dada una ruta Q y dos vértices U, V en Q, denotamos la subputa de Q de U a V por Qu, V. El siguiente lema, cuya prueba aparece en la versión completa, sería la principal herramienta topológica en el caso del gráfico de fuente única. Lema 2.1. Sea G un SPG con fuente S y sumidero t.Dada una ruta q, de s a t, y un vértice t, existe un vértice y ∈ Q, de modo que para cualquier ruta q de s a t, la ruta Q contiene y y las rutas Qy, T y Q son disjuntas de borde.(Llamamos al vértice y el vértice de intersección de Q y T.) 3. Juegos de conexión justa Esta sección deriva nuestros resultados para los juegos de conexión justa.3.1 Existencia de un equilibrio fuerte Si bien se sabe que cada juego de conexión justo posee un equilibrio de Nash en estrategias puras [2], este no es necesariamente el caso de un equilibrio fuerte. En esta sección, estudiamos la existencia de un fuerte equilibrio en los juegos de conexión justa. Comenzamos con un caso simple, mostrando que cada juego de conexión justo simétrico posee un fuerte equilibrio. Teorema 3.1. En cada juego de conexión justo simétrico existe un fuerte equilibrio. Prueba. Sea s la fuente y sea el fregadero de todos los jugadores. Mostramos que un perfil S en el que todos los jugadores eligen la misma ruta más corta Q (desde la fuente S hasta el sumidero t) es un fuerte equilibrio. Supongamos por contradicción que S no es un SE. Luego hay una coalición γ que puede desviarse a un nuevo perfil S de modo que el costo de cada jugador J ∈ γ disminuya. Deje que QJ sea una nueva ruta utilizada por el jugador j ∈ γ. Dado que Q es una ruta más corta, sostiene que C (QJ \\ (Q ∩ Qj)) ≥ C (Q \\ (Q ∩ Qj)), para cualquier ruta QJ. Por lo tanto, para cada jugador j ∈ γ tenemos que CJ (s) ≥ CJ (s). Sin embargo, esto contradice el hecho de que todos los jugadores en γ reducen su costo.(De hecho, ningún jugador en γ ha reducido su costo). Si bien cada juego de conexión justa simétrica admite un SE, no se mantiene para cada juego de conexión justo. En lo que sigue, estudiamos las topologías de la red que admiten un fuerte equilibrio para cualquier asignación de costos de borde, y damos ejemplos de topologías para las cuales no existe un equilibrio fuerte. El siguiente lema, cuya prueba aparece en la versión completa, juega un papel importante en nuestras pruebas de la existencia de SE. Lema 3.2. Sea λ un juego de conexión justo en un gráfico paralelo de serie G con fuente S y sumidero t.Suponga que el jugador I tiene Si = S y Ti = T y que λ tiene algo de SE. Sea un SE que minimiza el costo del jugador I (de todos los SE), es decir, CI (s) = mint ∈ (λ) ci (t) y sea S ∗ el perfil que minimiza el costo del jugador i(de todos los perfiles posibles), es decir, CI (S ∗) = mint ∈σ ci (t). Entonces, ci (s) = ci (s ∗). El siguiente lema considera la composición paralela. Lema 3.3. Sea λ un juego de conexión justo en el gráfico G = G1 || G2, donde G1 y G2 son gráficos paralelos de la serie. Si cada juego de conexión justo en los gráficos G1 y G2 poseen un fuerte equilibrio, entonces el juego λ posee un fuerte equilibrio. Prueba. Deje que G1 = (V1, E1) y G2 = (V2, E2) tengan fuentes S1 y S2 y se hundan T1 y T2, respectivamente. Sea ti el conjunto de jugadores con un punto final en vi \\ {s, t}, porque i ∈ {1, 2}.(Un punto final es una fuente o un fregadero de un jugador). Sea T3 el conjunto de jugadores j tal que sj = sy tj = t.Sea λ1 y λ2 el juego original en los gráficos respectivos G1 y G2 con los jugadores T1 ∪ T3 y T2 ∪ T3, respectivamente. Sea S y S el SE en λ1 y λ2 que minimiza el costo de los jugadores en T3, respectivamente. Suponga W.L.O.G.que CI (S) ≤ CI (s) donde el jugador i ∈ T3. Además, deje que λ2 sea el juego en el gráfico G2 con los jugadores T2 y sea un SE en λ2. Mostraremos que el perfil S = S ∪ ¯s es un SE en λ. Supongamos por contradicción que S no es un SE. Luego, hay una coalición γ que puede desviarse de tal manera que el costo de cada jugador J ∈ γ disminuya. Por el Lema 3.2 y la suposición de que CI (S) ≤ CI (S), un jugador J ∈ T3 no puede mejorar su costo. Por lo tanto, γ ⊆ T1 ∪ T2. Pero esta es una contradicción para que S sea un SE en λ1 o ¯s siendo un SE en λ2. El siguiente teorema considera el caso de los juegos de conexión justa de fuente única. Teorema 3.4. Cada juego de conexión justa de origen en un gráfico en serie paralelo posee un fuerte equilibrio. Prueba. Probamos el teorema por inducción en el tamaño de la red | V |. El reclamo obviamente se mantiene si | V |= 2. Mostramos el reclamo para una composición en serie, es decir, G = G1 → G2, y para una composición paralela, es decir, G = G1 || G2, donde G1 = (V1, E1) y G2 = (V2, E2) son SPGScon las fuentes S1, S2 y los sumideros T1, T2, respectivamente.Composición en serie. Sea G = G1 → G2. Sea T1 el conjunto de jugadores j tal que tj ∈ V1 y T2 como el conjunto de jugadores j tal que tj ∈ V2 \\ {S2}. Sea λ1 y λ2 el juego original en los gráficos respectivos G1 y G2 con los jugadores T1 ∪ T2 y T2, respectivamente. Para cada jugador i ∈ T2 con acción si en el juego λ, deje Si ∩e1 sea su acción inducida en el juego λ1, y SI ∩E2 sea su acción inducida en el juego λ2. Sea un SE en λ1 que minimiza el costo de los jugadores en T2 (tal SE existe por la hipótesis de inducción y el lema 3.2). Sea cualquier SE en λ2. Mostraremos que el perfil s = s ∪ s es un SE en el juego λ, es decir, para el jugador j ∈ T2 usamos el perfil sj = sj ∪ sj. Supongamos por contradicción que S no es un SE. Luego, hay una coalición γ que puede desviarse de tal manera que el costo de cada jugador J ∈ γ disminuya. Ahora, hay dos casos: Caso 1: γ ⊆ T1. Esta es una contradicción de ser un SE. Caso 2: existe un jugador j ∈ γ ∩ t2. Por Lemma 3.2, el jugador J no puede mejorar su costo en λ1, por lo que la mejora se debe a λ2. Considere la coalición γ ∩ T2, aún mejoraría su costo. Sin embargo, esto contradice el hecho de que S es un SE en λ2.Composición paralela. Sigue del Lema 3.3. Mientras que los juegos de conexión justo de productos múltiples en los gráficos paralelos de la serie no necesariamente poseen un SE (ver Teorema 3.6), los juegos de conexión justo en los gráficos paralelos de extensión siempre poseen un fuerte equilibrio. Teorema 3.5. Cada juego de conexión justo en un gráfico paralelo de extensión posee un fuerte equilibrio.87 T2 T1 S1 S2 2 2 1 3 3 1 (B) (A) A B E F C D Figura 1: Topologías gráficas. Prueba. Probamos el teorema por inducción en el tamaño de la red | V |. Sea λ un juego de conexión justo en un EPG G = (V, E). El reclamo obviamente se mantiene si | V |= 2. Si el gráfico G es una composición paralela de dos gráficos EPG G1 y G2, entonces la afirmación se deduce del Lemma 3.3. Queda por probar el reclamo de composición de extensión. Suponga que el gráfico G es una composición de extensión del gráfico G1 que consiste en un solo borde E = (S1, T1) y un EPG G2 = (V2, E2) con los terminales S2, T2, de modo que S = S1 y T = T2.(El caso de que G2 es un solo borde es similar). Deje que T1 sea el conjunto de jugadores con la fuente S1 y el sumidero T1 (es decir, su camino está en G1). Deje que T2 sea el conjunto de jugadores con fuente y hundimiento en G2. Deje que T3 sea el conjunto de jugadores con la fuente S1 y se hunde en V2 \\ T1. Sea λ1 y λ2 el juego original en los gráficos respectivos G1 y G2 con los jugadores T1 ∪ T3 y T2 ∪ T3, respectivamente. Sea s, s se en λ1 y λ2 respectivamente. Mostraremos que el perfil S = S ∪ s es un SE en el juego λ. Supongamos por contradicción que S no es un SE. Luego, hay una coalición γ de tamaño mínimo que puede desviarse de tal manera que el costo de cualquier jugador J ∈ γ disminuya. Claramente, T1 ∩γ = φ, ya que los jugadores en T1 tienen una sola estrategia. Por lo tanto, γ ⊆ T2 ∪T3. Cualquier jugador j ∈ T2 ∪T3 no puede mejorar su costo en λ1. Por lo tanto, cualquier jugador j ∈ T2 ∪ T3 mejora su costo en λ2. Sin embargo, esto contradice el hecho de que S es un SE en λ2. En el siguiente teorema, proporcionamos algunos ejemplos de topologías en los que no existe un fuerte equilibrio, lo que demuestra que nuestra caracterización es casi ajustada. Teorema 3.6. Existen los siguientes juegos de conexión: (1) Existe un juego de conexión de múltiples productos básicos en un gráfico paralelo en serie que no posee un equilibrio fuerte.(2) Existe un juego de conexión justa de fuente única que no posee un fuerte equilibrio. Prueba. Para el reclamo (1) considere el gráfico representado en la Figura 1 (a). Este juego tiene un NE único donde S1 = {E, C}, S2 = {B, F}, y cada jugador tiene un costo de 5.7 Sin embargo, considere la siguiente desviación coordinada s. S1 = {a, b, c}, 7 En cualquier NE del juego, el jugador 1 comprará el borde E y el jugador 2 comprará el borde f.Esto es ya que la ruta alternativa, en la parte respectiva, le costará al jugador 2.5. Por lo tanto, el jugador 1 (Jugador 2) comprará el borde C (borde B) solo, y cada jugador tendrá un costo de 5. S 2 + 2 2 1 - 2 1 + 3 1 2 - 3 1 1 1 2 - 3T1 T2 A C D E F H G B Figura 2: Ejemplo de un juego de conexión de fuente única que no admite SE.y s2 = {b, c, d}. En este perfil, cada jugador paga un costo de 4 y, por lo tanto, mejora su costo. Para el reclamo (2) considere un juego de conexión de una sola fuente en el gráfico G representado en la Figura 2. Hay dos jugadores. Jugador I = 1, 2 desea conectar la fuente S a su sumidero Ti y el NE único es S1 = {A, B}, S2 = {A, C}, y cada jugador tiene un costo de 2. 8 entonces, ambosLos jugadores pueden desviarse a S1 = {H, F, D} y S2 = {H, F, E}, y disminuir sus costos a 2 - /2. Desafortunadamente, nuestra caracterización no es completamente ajustada. El gráfico en la Figura 1 (b) es un ejemplo de un gráfico paralelo no extensión que siempre admite un fuerte equilibrio.3.2 Fuerte precio de la anarquía Si bien el precio de la anarquía en los juegos de conexión justa puede ser tan malo como n, el siguiente teorema muestra que el fuerte precio de la anarquía está limitado por h (n) = n i = 1 1 i = θ (log n). Teorema 3.7. El fuerte precio de la anarquía de un juego de conexión justo con N jugadores es como máximo H (n). Prueba. Sea λ un juego de conexión justo en el gráfico G. Denotamos por λ (γ) el juego jugado en el gráfico G por un conjunto de jugadores γ, donde la acción del jugador i ∈ γ permanece σi (igual que en λ). Sea s = (s1, ..., sn) un perfil en el juego λ. Denotamos por S (γ) = Sγ el perfil inducido de los jugadores en γ en el juego λ (γ). Deje que Ne (S (γ)) denote la carga de borde E bajo el perfil S (γ) en el juego λ (γ), es decir, NE (S (γ)) = | {J | J ∈ γ, e ∈ Sj} |. Similar a los juegos de congestión [16, 13] denotamos por φ (s (γ)) la función potencial del perfil S (γ) en el juego λ (γ), donde φ (s (γ)) = e∈E ne(S (γ)) J = 1 Fe (J), y defina φ (S (φ)) = 0. En nuestro caso, sostiene que φ (s) = e∈E ce · h (ne (s)).(1) Sea un SE, y sea S ∗ el perfil de la solución óptima. Definimos un pedido de los jugadores de la siguiente manera. Sea γn = {1, ..., n} el conjunto de todos los jugadores. Para cada k = 8 podemos demostrar que este es el NE único por un análisis de caso simple: (i) Si S1 = {H, F, D} y S2 = {H, F, E}, entonces el jugador 1 puede desviarse aS1 = {H, G} y disminuye su costo.(ii) Si S1 = {H, G} y S2 = {H, F, E}, entonces el jugador 2 puede desviarse a S2 = {A, C} y disminuir su costo.(iii) Si s1 = {h, g} y s2 = {a, c}, entonces el jugador 1 puede desviarse a s1 = {a, b} y disminuir su costo.88 n ,..., 1, ya que S es un SE, existe un jugador en γk, w.l.o.g.Llámalo Jugador K, de modo que, CK (S) ≤ CK (S - γk, S ∗ γk).(2) De esta manera, γk se define recursivamente, de modo que para cada k = n ,..., 2 sostiene que γk - 1 = γk \\ {k}.(Es decir, después del cambio de nombre, γk = {1, ..., K}.) Deje que CK (S (γk)) denote el costo del jugador K en el juego λ (γk) bajo el perfil inducido S (γk). Es fácil ver que CK (S (γk)) = φ (S (γk)) - φ (S (γk - 1)). 9 Por lo tanto, CK (S) ≤ CK (S - γk, S ∗ γk)(3) ≤ ck (S ∗ (γk)) = φ (S ∗ (γk)) - φ (S ∗ (γk - 1)). En resumen de todos los jugadores, obtenemos: i∈N ci (s) ≤ φ (s ∗ (γn)) - φ (s ∗ (φ)) = φ (s ∗ (γn)) = e∈S ∗ ce · h(ne (s ∗)) ≤ e∈S ∗ ce · h (n) = h (n) · opt (λ), donde la primera desigualdad sigue ya que la suma del lado derecho de la ecuación (3) telescopios, yLa segunda igualdad se deduce de la ecuación (1). A continuación, atamos al SPOA cuando se permiten coaliciones de tamaño en la mayoría de K. Teorema 3.8. El K-SPOA de un juego de conexión justo con N Players es como máximo N K · H (K). Prueba. Sea s un SE de λ, y s ∗ sea el perfil de la solución óptima de λ. Para simplificar la prueba, suponemos que N/K es un entero. Participamos a los jugadores a los grupos N/K T1 ,..., Tn/k cada uno de tamaño k.Sea λj el juego en el gráfico G jugado por el conjunto de jugadores TJ. Sea s (tj) denotar el perfil de los k jugadores en TJ en el juego λj inducido por el perfil S del juego λ. Por el Teorema 3.7, sostiene que para cada juego λj, j = 1 ,..., n/k, costλj (s (tj)) = i∈Tj ci (s (tj)) ≤ h (k) · opt (λj) ≤ h (k) · opt (λ). Sumando sobre todos los juegos λj, j = 1 ,..., n/k, costλ (s) ≤ n/k j = 1 costλj (s (tj)) ≤ n k · h (k) · opt (λ), donde la primera desigualdad sigue ya que para cada grupo tj y jugador i ∈ TJ, sostiene que CI (S) ≤ Ci (S (TJ)). A continuación, mostramos un límite inferior casi coincidente.(El límite inferior es como máximo h (n) = o (log n) del límite superior y tanto para k = o (1) como k = ω (n) La diferencia es solo una constante). Teorema 3.9. Para juegos de conexión justos con N jugadores, K-SPOA ≥ Max {N K, H (N)}.9 Esto sigue ya que para cualquier perfil de estrategia, si un solo jugador k se desvía a la estrategia SK, entonces el cambio en el valor potencial φ (s) - φ (SK, S - K) es exactamente el cambio en el costo para el jugador K.T2 S T1 TN - 2 TN 1 2 T3 Tn - 1 1 1 3 1 N - 2 2 N 1 + 00 0 0 0 00 0 Figura 3: Ejemplo de una topología de red en la que SPO> pos. Prueba. Para el límite inferior de H (n) observamos que en el ejemplo presentado en [2], el equilibrio NASH único también es un equilibrio fuerte y, por lo tanto, K-SPOA = H (n) para cualquier 1 ≤ k ≤ n.Para el límite inferior de N/K, considere un gráfico compuesto por dos enlaces paralelos de costos 1 y N/K. Considere el perfil en el que todos los n jugadores usan el enlace de costo n/k. El costo de cada jugador es de 1/k, mientras que si alguna coalición de tamaño en la mayoría se desvía al enlace del costo 1, el costo de cada jugador es de al menos 1/k. Por lo tanto, el perfil S es un K-SE y K-SPOA = N/K. Los resultados de los teoremas 3.7 y 3.8 pueden extenderse a las funciones de costo cóncavo. Considere el juego de conexión justo extendido, donde cada borde tiene un costo que depende de la cantidad de jugadores que usan ese borde, CE (NE). Suponemos que la función de costo CE (NE) es una función cóncava no decorativa. Tenga en cuenta que el costo de un borde CE (NE) podría aumentar con el número de jugadores que lo usan, pero el costo por jugador Fe (NE) = CE (NE)/NE disminuye cuando CE (NE) es cóncavo. Teorema 3.10. El fuerte precio de la anarquía de un juego de conexión justo con funciones de costo de borde cóncavo no decorativo y es como máximo H (n). Prueba. La prueba son análogos para la prueba del teorema 3.7. Para la prueba, mostramos que los costos ≤ φ (s ∗) ≤ h (n) · costo (s ∗). Primero mostramos la primera desigualdad. Dado que la función CE (x) es cóncava, el costo por reproductor CE (x)/x es una función no aumentable. Por lo tanto, la desigualdad (3) en la prueba del teorema 3.7 se mantiene. Resumiendo la desigualdad (3) En todos los jugadores, obtenemos costos (s) = i Ci (s) ≤ φ (s ∗ (γn)) - φ (s ∗ (φ)) = φ (s ∗). La segunda desigualdad sigue ya que CE (x) no es decisiva y, por lo tanto, ne x = 1 (ce (x)/x) ≤ h (ne) · ce (ne). Usando los argumentos en la prueba del teorema 3.10 y la prueba del teorema 3.8 Derive, Teorema 3.11. El K-SPOA de un juego de conexión justo con funciones de costo de borde cóncavo no lo es como máximo es como máximo n k · h (k). Dado que el conjunto de equilibrios fuertes está contenido en el conjunto de equilibrios Nash, debe sostener que SPOA ≤ POA, lo que significa que el SPOA solo puede mejorarse en comparación con el POA. Sin embargo, con respecto al precio de la estabilidad, la dirección opuesta tiene, es decir, SPO ≥ pos. Luego mostramos que existe un juego de conexión justo en el que la desigualdad es estricta.89 2 - 2 - 2 - 3 S T1 T2 T3 Figura 4: Ejemplo de un juego de conexión general de fuente única que no admite un equilibrio fuerte. Los bordes que no están etiquetados con costos tienen un costo de cero. Teorema 3.12. Existe un juego de conexión justo en el que SPO> pos. Prueba. Considere un juego de conexión de una sola fuente en el gráfico G representado en la Figura 3.10 Jugador I = 1 ,..., n desea conectar la fuente S a su fregadero. Suponga que cada jugador i = 1 ,..., N - 2 tiene su propio camino de costo 1/i de s a ti y los jugadores i = n - 1, n tienen una ruta conjunta de costo 2/n de s a ti. Además, todos los jugadores pueden compartir un camino común de costo 1+ para algunos pequeños> 0. La solución óptima conecta a todos los jugadores a través de la ruta común del costo 1 +, y esto también es un equilibrio de Nash con costo total 1 +. Es fácil verificar que la solución donde cada jugador i = 1 ,..., n - 2 usa su propia ruta y usuarios i = n - 1, n usar su ruta conjunta es el equilibrio único y único de este juego con el costo total n - 2 i = 1 1 i + 2 n = θ (log n) mientrasEl ejemplo anterior muestra que las SPO pueden ser mayores que el POS, el límite superior de H (n) = θ (log n), probado para el POS [2], sirve como un límite superior para los SPO también. Este es un corolario directo del Teorema 3.7, como SPO ≤ SPOA por definición. Corolario 3.13. El fuerte precio de la estabilidad de un juego de conexión justo con N jugadores es como máximo h (n) = o (log n).4. Juegos de conexión general En esta sección, derivamos nuestros resultados para los juegos de conexión general.4.1 Existencia de un fuerte equilibrio, comenzamos con una caracterización de la existencia de un fuerte equilibrio en los juegos de conexión general simétrica. Similar al Teorema 3.1 (usando una prueba similar) establecemos, Teorema 4.1. En cada juego de conexión justo simétrico existe un fuerte equilibrio. Si bien cada juego de conexión general de fuente posee un equilibrio de Nash puro [3], no necesariamente admite un equilibrio fuerte.11 10 Esta es una variación en el ejemplo dado en [2].11 Agradecemos a Elliot Anshelevich, cuya topología similar para el juego de conexión justa inspiró este ejemplo. Teorema 4.2. Existe un juego de conexión general de una sola fuente que no admite ningún equilibrio fuerte. Prueba. Considere el juego de conexión general de fuente de una sola fuente con 3 jugadores en el gráfico representado en la Figura 4. Jugador Deseo conectar la fuente S con su sumidero Ti. Necesitamos considerar solo los perfiles de NE: (i) Si los tres jugadores usan el enlace de costo 3, entonces debe haber dos agentes cuya suma total excede 2, por lo tanto, ellospueden reducir el costo al desviarse a un borde de costo 2-.(ii) Si dos de los jugadores usan un borde de costo 2- conjuntamente, y el tercer jugador usa un borde diferente de costo 2, entonces, los jugadores con pagos distintos de cero pueden desviarse al camino con el borde del costo 3y reducir sus costos (ya que antes de la desviación, los pagos totales de los jugadores son 4 - 2). Mostramos que ninguno de los NE es SE y, por lo tanto, el juego no posee ningún SE. A continuación, mostramos que para la clase de gráficos paralelos de la serie, siempre hay un fuerte equilibrio en el caso de una sola fuente. Teorema 4.3. En cada juego de conexión general de fuente en un gráfico en serie paralelo, existe un fuerte equilibrio. Prueba. Sea λ un juego de conexión general de una sola fuente en un spg g = (v, e) con fuente sy sumidero t.Presentamos un algoritmo que construye un SE específico. Primero consideramos el siguiente orden parcial entre los jugadores. Para los jugadores I y J, tenemos que yo → J si hay un camino dirigido de TI a TJ. Completamos el orden parcial a un pedido completo (de manera arbitraria), y W.L.O.G.Asumimos que 1 → 2 → · · · → n.El algoritmo Compute-SE considera a los jugadores en un orden creciente, comenzando con el Jugador 1. Cada jugador compraré completamente un subconjunto de los bordes, y cualquier jugador j> consideraré el costo de esos bordes (comprados) como cero. Cuando Compute-SE considera al jugador J, el costo de los bordes que los jugadores 1 a J-1 han comprado se establece en cero, y el jugador J compra completamente una ruta más corta QJ de S a TJ. A saber, para cada bordes e ∈ Qj \\ ∪i <jqi tenemos pj (e) = ce y de lo contrario pj (e) = 0. A continuación, mostramos que el algoritmo Comptese calcula un SE. Suponga a modo de contradicción que el perfil P no es un SE. Luego, existe una coalición que puede mejorar los costos de todos sus jugadores mediante una desviación. Sea γ una coalición así de tamaño mínimo y deje que el jugador i = max {j ∈ γ}. Para un jugador j ∈ γ, dejen ¯qj y ¯pj sea el camino y el pago del jugador J después de la desviación, respectivamente. Deje que Q sea un camino desde el fregadero del jugador I, es decir, Ti, hasta el fregadero de G, es decir, t.Entonces q = ¯qi ∪ q es una ruta desde la fuente S al fregadero t.Para cualquier jugador J <i, deje que YJ sea el vértice de intersección de Q y TJ (por Lemma 2.1 se garantiza que exista). Sea y sea el vértice más alejado en el camino q tal que y = yj para algunos j <i. La ruta de la fuente S al Nodo Y fue completamente pagada por los jugadores J <I en P (antes de la desviación). Hay dos casos que consideramos.Caso A: Después del reproductor de desviación, no paga los bordes en j∈γ \\ {i} ¯qj. Esta es una contradicción con la minimalidad del tamaño de la coalición γ, ya que los jugadores en γ \\ {i} pueden formar una coalición más pequeña con pagos ¯p.Caso B: De lo contrario, mostramos que el jugador que cuesta después de la desviación, es decir, CI (¯p), es al menos su costo antes de la desviación, es decir, CI (P), contradiciendo el hecho de que el jugador mejoró su costo. Recuerde que dado dos vértices u, v en la ruta ¯q denotamos por ¯qu, v El subpato de ¯q de u a v. 90 antes de la desviación de la coalición γ, una ruta de s a y fue completamente pagada por elJugadores j <i. A continuación, mostramos que ningún jugador k> paga por cualquier borde en cualquier camino de S a Ti. Considere un jugador k> i y deje qk = qk ∪ qk, donde QK es una ruta que conecta tk a t.Sea Yk el vértice de intersección de Qk y Ti. Dado que existe una ruta de S a YK que los jugadores pagan por completo antes de la desviación, en particular el camino Qi S, YK, el jugador K no pagará por ninguna ventaja en ninguna ruta que conecte S e YK. Por lo tanto, el jugador i paga completamente por todos los bordes en la ruta ¯qi y, ti, es decir, ¯pi (e) = ce para todos los bordes e ∈ ¯qi y, ti. Ahora considere el algoritmo Comptesés en el paso cuando el jugador I selecciona una ruta más corta desde la fuente S hasta su sumidero TI y determina su Pi de pago. En este punto, el jugador podría comprar el camino ¯qi y, ti, ya que los jugadores ya pagaron un camino de S a Y. Por lo tanto, CI (¯p) ≥ CI (P). Esto contradice el hecho de que el jugador que mejoró su costo y, por lo tanto, no todos los jugadores en γ reducen su costo. Esto implica que P es un equilibrio fuerte.4.2 Precio fuerte de la anarquía Mientras que para cada juego de conexión general de origen, sostiene que pos = 1 [3], el precio de la anarquía puede ser tan grande como n, incluso para dos bordes paralelos. Aquí, mostramos que cualquier equilibrio fuerte en los juegos de conexión general de una sola fuente produce el costo óptimo. Teorema 4.4. En el juego de conexión general de una sola fuente, si existe un fuerte equilibrio, entonces el fuerte precio de la anarquía es 1. Prueba. Sea P = (P1, ..., Pn) un fuerte equilibrio, y sea T ∗ el árbol Steiner de costo mínimo en todos los jugadores, enraizados en la fuente (única) s.Sea t ∗ e el subárbol de t ∗ desconectado de s cuando se elimina el borde E. Sea γ (TE) el conjunto de jugadores que tienen sumideros en TE. Para un conjunto de bordes e, deje c (e) = e∈E ce. Sea p (te) = i∈γ (te) ci (p). Suponga a modo de contradicción que c (p)> c (t ∗). Mostraremos que existe un sub-árbol t de t ∗, que conecta un subconjunto de jugadores γ ⊆ n, y un nuevo conjunto de pagos ¯p, de modo que para cada i ∈ γ, ci (¯p) <ci ((pag). Esto contradecirá la suposición de que P es un fuerte equilibrio. Primero mostramos cómo encontrar un sub-árbol de t ∗, de modo que para cualquier borde e, los pagos de jugadores con sumideros en t ∗ e es más que el costo de t ∗ e ∪ {e}. Para construir t, defina un borde e para que sea malo si el costo de t ∗ e ∪ {e} es al menos los pagos de los jugadores con sumideros en t ∗ e, es decir, c (t ∗ e ∪ {e}) ≥P (T ∗ E). Sea B el conjunto de bordes malos. Definimos que t ∗ - ∪e∈B (t ∗ e ∪ {e}). Tenga en cuenta que podemos encontrar un subconjunto b de B tal que ∪e∈B (t ∗ e ∪ {e}) es igual a ∪e∈B (t ∗ e ∪ {e}) y para cualquier e1, e2 ∈ B we we wetener t ∗ e1 ∩ t ∗ e2 = ∅.(El conjunto B incluirá cualquier borde e ∈ B para el cual no hay otro borde e ∈ B en la ruta de E a la fuente s.) Teniendo en cuenta los bordes en e ∈ B podemos ver que cualquier subárbol t ∗ E eliminamosDe T no puede disminuir la diferencia entre los pagos y el costo del árbol restante. Por lo tanto, en t para cada borde e, tenemos esa c (te ∪ {e}) <p (te). Ahora tenemos un árbol t y nuestra coalición será γ (t). Lo que queda es encontrar pagos ¯p para los jugadores en γ (t) de modo que comprarán el árbol T y cada jugador en γ (t) reducirá su costo, es decir, CI (P)> CI (¯p) para i∈ γ (t).(Recuerde que los pagos tienen la restricción de ese jugador que solo puedo pagar por los bordes en el camino de S a Ti). Ahora definiremos los pagos de la coalición ¯p. Deje que Ci (¯p, te) = e∈Te ¯pi (e) los pagos del jugador I por el subárbol TE. Mostraremos que para cada subárbol TE, ci (¯p, te ∪ {e}) <ci (p) y, por lo tanto, ci (¯p) <ci (p). Considere el siguiente proceso de abajo hacia arriba que define ¯p. Asignamos los pagos de Edge E en T, después de asignar pagos a todos los bordes en TE. Esto implica que cuando asignamos pagos para E, tenemos que la suma de los pagos en TE es igual a C (TE) = i∈γ (TE) CI (¯p, TE). Como E no era un borde malo, sabemos que C (TE ∪ {E}) = C (TE) + Ce <P (TE). Por lo tanto, podemos actualizar los pagos ¯p de los jugadores i ∈ γ (TE), estableciendo ¯pi (e) = ce∆i/(j∈γ (te) ∆j), donde ∆J = cj (p) -−CJ (¯p, TE). Después de la actualización que tenemos para el jugador i ∈ γ (TE), CI (¯p, TE ∪ {e}) = ci (¯p, te) + ¯pi (e) = ci (¯p, te) + ∆ice j∈γ (TE) ∆J = Ci (P) - ∆I (1 - Ce P (γ (TE)) - C (TE)), donde usamos el hecho de que j∈γ (TE) ∆J =P (γ (TE)) - C (TE). Dado que ce <p (γ (TE)) - C (TE) se deduce que Ci (¯p, TE ∪ {e}) <ci (P).5. Referencias [1] N. Andelman, M. Feldman e Y. Mansour. Fuerte precio de la anarquía. En Soda07, 2007. [2] E. Anshelevich, A.

        "INTRODUCTION Computational game theory has introduced the issue of incentives to many of the classical combinatorial optimization problems.",
        "The view that the demand side is many times not under the control of a central authority that optimizes the global performance, but rather under the control of individuals with different incentives, has led already to many important insights.",
        "Consider classical routing and transportation problems such as multicast or multi-commodity problems, which are many times viewed as follows.",
        "We are given a graph with edge costs and connectivity demands between nodes, and our goal is to find a minimal cost solution.",
        "The classical centralized approach assumes that all the individual demands can both be completely coordinated and have no individual incentives.",
        "The game theory point of view would assume that each individual demand is controlled by a player that optimizes its own utility, and the resulting outcome could be far from the optimal solution.",
        "When considering individual incentives one needs to discuss the appropriate solution concept.",
        "Much of the research in computational game theory has focused on the classical Nash equilibrium as the primary solution concept.",
        "Indeed Nash equilibrium has many benefits, and most importantly it always exists (in mixed strategies).",
        "However, the solution concept of Nash equilibrium is resilient only to unilateral deviations, while in reality, players may be able to coordinate their actions.",
        "A strong equilibrium [4] is a state from which no coalition (of any size) can deviate and improve the utility of every member of the coalition (while possibly lowering the utility 84 of players outside the coalition).",
        "This resilience to deviations by coalitions of the players is highly attractive, and one can hope that once a strong equilibrium is reached it is highly likely to sustain.",
        "From a computational game theory point of view, an additional benefit of a strong equilibrium is that it has a potential to reduce the distance between the optimal solution and the solution obtained as an outcome of selfish behavior.",
        "The strong price of anarchy (SPoA), introduced in [1], is the ratio between the cost of the worst strong equilibrium and the cost of an optimal solution.",
        "Obviously, SPoA is meaningful only in those cases where a strong equilibrium exists.",
        "A major downside of strong equilibrium is that most games do not admit any strong equilibrium.",
        "Even simple classical games like the prisoners dilemma do not posses any strong equilibrium (which is also an example of a congestion game that does not posses a strong equilibrium1 ).",
        "This unfortunate fact has reduced the concentration in strong equilibrium, despite its highly attractive properties.",
        "Yet, [1] have identified two broad families of games, namely job scheduling and network formation, where a strong equilibrium always exists and the SPoA is significantly lower than the price of anarchy (which is the ratio between the worst Nash equilibrium and the optimal solution [15, 18, 5, 6]).",
        "In this work we concentrate on cost sharing connection games, introduced by [3, 2].",
        "In such a game, there is an underlying directed graph with edge costs, and individual users have connectivity demands (between a source and a sink).",

        "In this game the cost of an edge is shared equally between all the players that selected the edge, and the cost of the player is the sum of its costs on the edges it selected.",
        "The general connection game [3] allows each player to offer prices for edges.",
        "In this game an edge is bought if the sum of the offers at least covers its cost, and the cost of the player is the sum of its offers on the bought edges (in both games we assume that the player has to guarantee the connectivity between its source and sink).",
        "In this work we focus on two important issues.",
        "The first one is identifying under what conditions the existence of a strong equilibrium is guaranteed, and the second one is the quality of the strong equilibria.",
        "For the existence part, we identify families of graph topologies that possess some strong equilibrium for any assignment of edge costs.",
        "One can view this separation between the graph topology and the edge costs, as a separation between the underlying infrastructure and the costs the players observe to purchase edges.",
        "While one expects the infrastructure to be stable over long periods of time, the costs the players observe can be easily modified over short time periods.",

        "For the single commodity case (all the players have the same source and sink), there is a strong equilibrium in any graph (both for fair and general connection games).",
        "Moreover, the strong equilibrium is also 1 while any congestion game is known to admit at least one Nash equilibrium in pure strategies [16]. 2 The fair cost sharing scheme is also attractive from a mechanism design point of view, as it is a strategyproof costsharing mechanism [14]. the optimal solution (namely, the players share a shortest path from the common source to the common sink).",
        "For the case of a single source and multiple sinks (for example, in a multicast tree), we show that in a fair connection game there is a strong equilibrium if the underlying graph is a series parallel graph, and we show an example of a nonseries parallel graph that does not have a strong equilibrium.",
        "For the case of multi-commodity (multi sources and sinks), we show that in a fair connection game if the graph is an extension parallel graph then there is always a strong equilibrium, and we show an example of a series parallel graph that does not have a strong equilibrium.",

        "In this case we also show that any strong equilibrium is optimal.",
        "Related work Topological characterizations for single-commodity network games have been recently provided for various equilibrium properties, including equilibrium existence [12, 7, 8], equilibrium uniqueness [10] and equilibrium efficiency [17, 11].",
        "The existence of pure Nash equilibrium in single-commodity network congestion games with player-specific costs or weights was studied in [12].",
        "The existence of strong equilibrium was studied in both utility-decreasing (e.g., routing) and utility-increasing (e.g., fair cost-sharing) congestion games. [7, 8] have provided a full topological characterization for a SE existence in single-commodity utility-decreasing congestion games, and showed that a SE always exists if and only if the underlying graph is extension-parallel. [19] have shown that in single-commodity utility-increasing congestion games, the topological characterization is essentially equivalent to parallel links.",
        "In addition, they have shown that these results hold for correlated strong equilibria as well (in contrast to the decreasing setting, where correlated strong equilibria might not exist at all).",

(The set B will include any edge e ∈ B for which there is no other edge e ∈ B on the path from e to the source s.) Considering the edges in e ∈ B we can see that any subtree T∗ e we delete from T can not decrease the difference between the payments and the cost of the remaining tree.",

(The set B will include any edge e ∈ B for which there is no other edge e ∈ B on the path from e to the source s.)

                "In every symmetric fair connection game there exists a strong equilibrium.",
                "While every single source general connection game possesses a pure Nash equilibrium [3], it does not necessarily admit some strong equilibrium.11 10 This is a variation on the example given in [2]. 11 We thank Elliot Anshelevich, whose similar topology for the fair-connection game inspired this example.",
                "Theorem 4.2.",
                "There exists a single source general connection game that does not admit any strong equilibrium.",
                "Proof.",
                "Consider single source general connection game with 3 players on the graph depicted in Figure 4.",
                "Player i wishes to connect the source s with its sink ti.We need to consider only the NE profiles: (i) if all three players use the link of cost 3, then there must be two agents whose total sum exceeds 2, thus they can both reduce cost by deviating to an edge of cost 2− . (ii) if two of the players use an edge of cost 2− jointly, and the third player uses a different edge of cost 2 − , then, the players with non-zero payments can deviate to the path with the edge of cost 3 and reduce their costs (since before the deviation the total payments of the players is 4 − 2 ).",
                "We showed that none of the NE are SE, and thus the game does not possess any SE.",
                "Next we show that for the class of series parallel graphs, there is always a strong equilibrium in the case of a single source.",
                "Theorem 4.3.",
                "In every single source general connection game on a series-parallel graph, there exists a strong equilibrium.",
                "Proof.",
                "Let Λ be a single source general connection game on a SPG G = (V, E) with source s and sink t. We present an algorithm that constructs a specific SE.",
                "We first consider the following partial order between the players.",
                "For players i and j, we have that i → j if there is a directed path from ti to tj.",
                "We complete the partial order to a full order (in an arbitrary way), and w.l.o.g. we assume that 1 → 2 → · · · → n. The algorithm COMPUTE-SE, considers the players in an increasing order, starting with player 1.",
                "Each player i will fully buy a subset of the edges, and any player j > i will consider the cost of those (bought) edges as zero.",
                "When COMPUTE-SE considers player j, the cost of the edges that players 1 to j−1 have bought is set to zero, and player j fully buys a shortest path Qj from s to tj.",

                "Assume by way of contradiction that the profile p is not a SE.",
                "Then, there exists a coalition that can improve the costs of all its players by a deviation.",
                "Let Γ be such a coalition of minimal size and let player i = max{j ∈ Γ}.",
                "For a player j ∈ Γ let ¯Qj and ¯pj be the path and payment of player j after the deviation, respectively.",
                "Let Q be a path from the sink of player i, i.e. ti, to the sink of G, i.e. t. Then Q = ¯Qi ∪ Q is a path from the source s to the sink t. For any player j < i, let yj be the intersecting vertex of Q and tj (by Lemma 2.1 one is guarantee to exist).",
                "Let y be the furthest vertex on the path Q such that y = yj for some j < i.",
                "The path from the source s to node y was fully paid for by players j < i in p (before the deviation).",
                "There are two cases we consider. case a: After the deviation player i does not pay for edges in j∈Γ\\{i} ¯Qj .",
                "This is a contradiction to the minimality of the coalition Γ size, since the players in Γ \\ {i} can form a smaller coalition with payments ¯p. case b: Otherwise, we show that player i cost after the deviation, i.e. ci(¯p), is at least his cost before the deviation, i.e. ci(p), contradicting the fact that player i improved his cost.",
                "Recall that given two vertices u, v on path ¯Q we denote by ¯Qu,v the subpath of ¯Q from u to v. 90 Before the deviation of the coalition Γ, a path from s to y was fully paid for by the players j < i.",
                "Next we show that no player k > i pays for any edge on any path from s to ti.",
                "Consider a player k > i and let Qk = Qk ∪ Qk , where Qk is a path connecting tk to t. Let yk be the intersecting vertex of Qk and ti.",
                "Since there exists a path from s to yk that was fully paid for by players j < k before the deviation, in particularly the path Qi s,yk , player k will not pay for any edge on any path connecting s and yk.",
                "Therefore player i fully pays for all edges on the path ¯Qi y,ti , i.e., ¯pi(e) = ce for all edges e ∈ ¯Qi y,ti .",
                "Now consider the algorithm COMPUTESE at the step when player i selects a shortest path from the source s to its sink ti and determines his payment pi.",
                "At this point, player i could buy the path ¯Qi y,ti , since a path from s to y was already paid for by players j < i.",
                "Hence, ci(¯p) ≥ ci(p).",
                "This contradicts the fact that player i improved its cost and therefore not all the players in Γ reduce their cost.",
                "This implies that p is a strong equilibrium. 4.2 Strong Price of Anarchy While for every single source general connection game, it holds that PoS = 1 [3], the price of anarchy can be as large as n, even for two parallel edges.",
                "Here, we show that any strong equilibrium in single source general connection games yields the optimal cost.",
                "Theorem 4.4.",
                "In single source general connection game, if there exists a strong equilibrium, then the strong price of anarchy is 1.",
                "Proof.",
                "Let p = (p1, . . . , pn) be a strong equilibrium, and let T∗ be the minimum cost Steiner tree on all players, rooted at the (single) source s. Let T∗ e be the subtree of T∗ disconnected from s when edge e is removed.",

                "Assume by way of contradiction that c(p) > c(T∗ ).",
                "We will show that there exists a sub-tree T of T∗ , that connects a subset of players Γ ⊆ N, and a new set of payments ¯p, such that for each i ∈ Γ, ci(¯p) < ci(p).",
                "This will contradict the assumption that p is a strong equilibrium.",
                "First we show how to find a sub-tree T of T∗ , such that for any edge e, the payments of players with sinks in T∗ e is more than the cost of T∗ e ∪ {e}.",
                "To build T , define an edge e to be bad if the cost of T∗ e ∪ {e} is at least the payments of the players with sinks in T∗ e , i.e., c(T∗ e ∪ {e}) ≥ P(T∗ e ).",
                "Let B be the set of bad edges.",
                "We define T to be T∗ − ∪e∈B(T∗ e ∪ {e}).",
                "Note that we can find a subset B of B such that ∪e∈B(T∗ e ∪ {e}) is equal to ∪e∈B (T∗ e ∪ {e}) and for any e1, e2 ∈ B we have T∗ e1 ∩ T∗ e2 = ∅. (The set B will include any edge e ∈ B for which there is no other edge e ∈ B on the path from e to the source s.) Considering the edges in e ∈ B we can see that any subtree T∗ e we delete from T can not decrease the difference between the payments and the cost of the remaining tree.",
                "Therefore, in T for every edge e, we have that c(Te ∪ {e}) < P(Te).",
                "Now we have a tree T and our coalition will be Γ(T ).",
                "What remain is to find payments ¯p for the players in Γ(T ) such that they will buy the tree T and every player in Γ(T ) will lower its cost, i.e. ci(p) > ci(¯p) for i ∈ Γ(T ). (Recall that the payments have the restriction that player i can only pay for edges on the path from s to ti.)",
                "We will now define the coalition payments ¯p.",
                "Let ci(¯p, Te) = e∈Te ¯pi(e) be the payments of player i for the subtree Te.",
                "We will show that for every subtree Te, ci(¯p, Te ∪ {e}) < ci(p), and hence ci(¯p) < ci(p).",

                "We assign the payments of edge e in T , after we assign payments to all the edges in Te.",
                "This implies that when we assign payments for e, we have that the sum of the payments in Te is equal to c(Te) = i∈Γ(Te) ci(¯p, Te).",
                "Since e was not a bad edge, we know that c(Te ∪ {e}) = c(Te) + ce < P(Te).",
                "Therefore, we can update the payments ¯p of players i ∈ Γ(Te), by setting ¯pi(e) = ce∆i/( j∈Γ(Te) ∆j), where ∆j = cj(p) − cj(¯p, Te).",
                "After the update we have for player i ∈ Γ(Te), ci(¯p, Te ∪ {e}) = ci(¯p, Te) + ¯pi(e) = ci(¯p, Te) + ∆i ce j∈Γ(Te) ∆j = ci(p) − ∆i(1 − ce P(Γ(Te)) − c(Te) ), where we used the fact that j∈Γ(Te) ∆j = P(Γ(Te))−c(Te).",
                "Since ce < P(Γ(Te)) − c(Te) it follows that ci(¯p, Te ∪ {e}) < ci(p). 5.",
