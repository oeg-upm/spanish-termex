In this paper we advocate a cooperative, context-aware approach to data center migration across WANs to deal with outages in a non-disruptive manner. We specifically seek to achieve high availability of data center services in the face of both planned and unanticipated outages of data center facilities. We make use of server virtualization technologies to enable the replication and migration of server functions.

INTRODUCTION A significant concern for Internet-based service providers is the continued operation and availability of services in the face of outages, whether planned or unplanned. These concerns are exacerbated by the increased use of the Internet for mission critical business and real-time entertainment applications. A relatively minor outage can disrupt and inconvenience a large number of users. Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers. Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment. In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion. Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22]. When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application. In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted. Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access. Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original. While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment. Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics. In this paper we outline a design for live service migration across WANs. Our design makes use of existing server virtualization technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate migration across a WAN. The essence of our approach is cooperative, context aware migration, where a migration management system orchestrates the data center migration across all three subsystems involved, namely the server platforms, the wide area network and the disk storage system. While conceptually similar in nature to the LAN based work described above, using migration technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has to our knowledge not been achieved. Our main contribution is the design of a framework that will allow the migration across a WAN of all subsystems involved with enabling data center services. We describe new mechanisms as well as extensions to existing technologies to enable this and outline the cooperative, context aware functionality needed across the different subsystems to enable this. 262 2. LIVE DATA CENTER MIGRATION ACROSS WANS Three essential subsystems are involved with hosting services in a data center: First, the servers host the application or service logic. Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs). Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications. Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption. For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components. For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level. Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc). Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies. The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient. Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events. As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN). By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components. Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques. In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole. We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation. Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks. In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach. As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8]. In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another. Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections. Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact. In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to. In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8]. Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22]. However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this. If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8]. Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23]. However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed. This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons. First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales. The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration. Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems. Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time. Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner. Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified. We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved. Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel. Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed. From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9]. First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster. Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13]. Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge. The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time. Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority. However, these desirable properties come at a price. First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16]. Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete. An alternative is to use asynchronous replication. However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system. But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems. For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics. Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation. When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step. The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center. In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3. WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network. We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN. We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach. In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled. In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts. First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements. This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway. Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center. Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility. Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B. Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent. The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ). After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers. Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration. Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B. When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network. For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B. For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center. Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B. Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B. However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ . To rectify this situation another networking step is involved. Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ . In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c). Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center. To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly. Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact. However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration. When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum. When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center. Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers. When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center. From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B. As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B. Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider. Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages. There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration. Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event. At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site. This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout. The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage. In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state. Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state. An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users. A spectrum of approaches are possible. In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session. More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk. Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site. Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only. Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing. Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state. Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs. Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11]. For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state. To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed. Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel. Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure. The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network. The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application. There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless. For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP. In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site. Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center. Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures. As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting. It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures. The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4. RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support. At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15]. Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8]. As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN. VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19]. Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12]. Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support. In the context of storage, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor. An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11]. The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1]. Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously. In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers. In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards. First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network). Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces). Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6]. In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5. CONCLUSION A significant concern for Internet-based service providers is the continued operation and availability of services in the face of outages, whether planned or unplanned. In this paper we advocated a cooperative, context-aware approach to data center migration across WANs to deal with outages in a non-disruptive manner. We sought to achieve high availability of data center services in the face of both planned and incidental outages of data center facilities. We advocated using server virtualization technologies to enable the replication and migration of server functions. We proposed new network functions to enable server migration and replication across wide area networks (such as the Internet or a geographically distributed virtual private network), and finally showed the utility of intelligent and dynamic storage replication technology to ensure applications have access to data in the face of outages with very tight recovery point objectives. 6.

Introducción Una preocupación significativa para los proveedores de servicios basados en Internet es la operación continua y la disponibilidad de servicios frente a las interrupciones, ya sea planificada o no planificada. Estas preocupaciones se ven exacerbadas por el mayor uso de Internet para las aplicaciones de negocios de misión crítica y entretenimiento en tiempo real. Una interrupción relativamente menor puede interrumpir e incomodar a un gran número de usuarios. Hoy, estos servicios se alojan casi exclusivamente en los centros de datos. Los avances recientes en las tecnologías de virtualización del servidor [8, 14, 22] permiten la migración en vivo de los servicios dentro de un entorno de red de área local (LAN). En el entorno LAN, estas tecnologías han demostrado ser una herramienta muy efectiva para permitir la gestión de centros de datos de manera no disruptiva. No solo puede admitir eventos de mantenimiento planificados [8], sino que también se puede utilizar de manera más dinámica para equilibrar automáticamente la carga entre los servidores físicos en un centro de datos [22]. Al usar estas tecnologías en un entorno LAN, los servicios se ejecutan en un servidor virtual, y los servicios de migración proporcionados por el marco de virtualización subyacente permiten que un servidor virtual se migre de un servidor físico a otro, sin ningún tiempo de inactividad significativo para el servicio o aplicación.. En particular, dado que el servidor virtual conserva la misma dirección de red que antes, cualquier interacción en curso de nivel de red no se interrumpe. Del mismo modo, en un entorno LAN, los requisitos de almacenamiento normalmente se cumplen a través de la red de almacenamiento adjunto (NAS) o a través de una red de área de almacenamiento (SAN) que todavía se puede acceder desde la nueva ubicación del servidor físico para permitir el acceso continuo de almacenamiento. Desafortunadamente, en un entorno de área amplia (WAN), la migración del servidor en vivo no se puede lograr tan fácilmente por dos razones: primero, la migración en vivo requiere que el servidor virtual mantenga la misma dirección de red para que desde un punto de vista de conectividad de red, el servidor migrado sea indistinguible deloriginal. Si bien esto se logra con bastante facilidad en un entorno LAN compartido, no hay mecanismos actuales disponibles para lograr eficientemente la misma hazaña en un entorno WAN. En segundo lugar, si bien se han desarrollado mecanismos de replicación remota bastante sofisticados en el contexto de la recuperación de desastres [20, 7, 11], estos mecanismos no son adecuados para la migración de centros de datos en vivo, porque en general las tecnologías disponibles no son conscientes de la semántica de nivel de aplicación/servicio. En este artículo describimos un diseño para la migración de servicios en vivo en Wans. Nuestro diseño utiliza tecnologías de virtualización de servidores existentes y propone mecanismos de red y almacenamiento para facilitar la migración a través de una WAN. La esencia de nuestro enfoque es la migración cooperativa y consciente del contexto, donde un sistema de gestión de migración orquesta la migración del centro de datos en los tres subsistemas involucrados, a saber, las plataformas del servidor, la red de área amplia y el sistema de almacenamiento de disco. Si bien es conceptualmente similar en la naturaleza al trabajo basado en LAN descrito anteriormente, el uso de tecnologías de migración en una red de área amplia presenta desafíos únicos y no se puede lograr, hasta donde sabemos. Nuestra principal contribución es el diseño de un marco que permitirá la migración a través de una WAN de todos los subsistemas involucrados con la habilitación de servicios de centros de datos. Describimos nuevos mecanismos, así como extensiones a las tecnologías existentes para habilitar esto y describir la funcionalidad cooperativa consciente de contexto necesaria en los diferentes subsistemas para habilitar esto.262 2. La migración del centro de datos en vivo a través de WANS se involucra tres subsistemas esenciales con los servicios de alojamiento en un centro de datos: primero, los servidores alojan la aplicación o la lógica del servicio. En segundo lugar, los servicios normalmente se alojan en un centro de datos para proporcionar acceso compartido a través de una red, Internet o redes privadas virtuales (VPN). Finalmente, la mayoría de las aplicaciones requieren almacenamiento en disco para almacenar datos y la cantidad de espacio en disco y la frecuencia de acceso varía mucho entre diferentes servicios/aplicaciones. Las interrupciones, fallas o, en general, las interrupciones de cualquier tipo de cualquiera de estos componentes causarán interrupción del servicio. Por esta razón, el trabajo previo y las prácticas actuales han abordado la robustez de los componentes individuales. Por ejemplo, los centros de datos generalmente tienen múltiples conexiones de red y dispositivos LAN redundantes para garantizar la redundancia en el nivel de red. Del mismo modo, los servidores físicos se están diseñando con componentes redundantes en caliente (discos, cuchillas de procesador, fuentes de alimentación, etc.). Finalmente, la redundancia a nivel de almacenamiento se puede proporcionar a través de tecnologías sofisticadas de reflejo de datos. Sin embargo, el enfoque de nuestro trabajo está en el caso en el que dichos mecanismos de redundancia local no son suficientes. Específicamente, estamos interesados en proporcionar disponibilidad de servicios cuando el centro de datos en su conjunto no está disponible, por ejemplo, debido a operaciones de mantenimiento de amplio centro de datos, o debido a eventos catastróficos. Como tal, nuestro enfoque básico es migrar los servicios entre centros de datos en todo el mundo es Red (WAN). Por necesidad, mover o migrar servicios de un centro de datos a otro debe considerar estos tres componentes. Históricamente, dicha migración ha sido de naturaleza disruptiva, que requiere tiempo de inactividad de los servicios reales involucrados o que requieren técnicas de replicación de peso pesado. En el último caso, se pueden poner a disposición réplicas simultáneamente de un servicio, lo que permite que un subconjunto del servicio se migren o mantenga sin afectar el servicio en su conjunto. Argumentamos que estos mecanismos existentes son inadecuados para satisfacer las necesidades de los servicios basados en la red, incluidos los servicios en tiempo real, en términos de disponibilidad y operación continua. En cambio, abogamos por un enfoque donde los subsistemas de servidor, red y almacenamiento cooperen y coordinen las acciones, de una manera que es consciente del contexto del servicio para realizar una migración perfecta en redes de área amplia. En esta sección describimos brevemente los bloques de construcción técnicos que permitirían nuestro enfoque. Como se describe a continuación, algunos de estos bloques de construcción existen, o existen en parte, mientras que en otros casos utilizamos el deseo de una alta disponibilidad de servicios como el conductor de los cambios que proponemos.2.1 Migración del servidor virtual en vivo El habilitador principal para nuestro enfoque son las capacidades de migración del servidor en vivo que se han desarrollado en el contexto de la virtualización del servidor en los últimos años [5, 8]. En este enfoque, se transfiere un sistema operativo en ejecución completo (incluidas cualquier aplicación activa) que se ejecuta como servidor virtual de una máquina física a otra. Dado que el servidor virtual se migra en su totalidad, tanto la aplicación como el estado de nivel del kernel se migran, incluido cualquier estado asociado con las conexiones de red en curso. Suponiendo que la accesibilidad del nivel de red para las direcciones de red de servidores virtuales se mantiene después de la migración, la implicación es que las aplicaciones que se ejecutan en el servidor virtual experimentan muy poco tiempo de inactividad (en el orden de decenas a cientos de milisegundos) y las conexiones de red en curso permanecen intactas. Para mantener la accesibilidad del nivel de red, las direcciones IP asociadas con el servidor virtual deben ser accesibles en el servidor físico donde se migra el servidor virtual. En un entorno LAN, esto se logra, ya sea emitiendo una respuesta ARP no solicitada para establecer el enlace entre la nueva dirección MAC y la dirección IP, o confiando en tecnologías de capa dos para permitir que el servidor virtual reutilice su dirección MAC (antigua) [8]. Debido a la dificultad del nivel de red en movimiento (es decir, direcciones IP) en un entorno no LAN enrutado, el uso de la migración de servidores en vivo como herramienta de administración se ha limitado a los entornos LAN [22]. Sin embargo, la migración del servidor virtual en el área amplia también será una herramienta atractiva, específicamente para lidiar con interrupciones y, por lo tanto, proponer mecanismos de red para habilitar esto. Si las necesidades de almacenamiento de disco se cumplen con el almacenamiento adjunto de la red (NAS), el almacenamiento se convierte en otra aplicación basada en la red y, por lo tanto, se puede abordar de la misma manera con la migración basada en LAN [8]. Los entornos de virtualización modernos también incluyen soporte para otras formas de almacenamiento (local), incluidas las redes de área de almacenamiento (SAN) [23]. Sin embargo, dado que proponemos utilizar la migración del servidor WAN como un medio para tratar las interrupciones completas del centro de datos, estos mecanismos son inadecuados para nuestros propósitos y a continuación proponemos la extensión a las tecnologías de replicación remota que pueden funcionar en concierto con la migración del servidor para minimizar el tiempo de inactividad del servicio.2.2 Requisitos de red de la discusión anterior, un requisito clave para la migración del servidor en vivo a través de una WAN es la capacidad de que las direcciones IP del servidor virtual sean accesibles en la nueva ubicación del centro de datos inmediatamente después de que la migración se haya completado. Esto presenta un desafío significativo por varias razones. Primero, a pesar de las décadas de trabajo en esta área, la movilidad de las direcciones IP sigue siendo un problema no resuelto que generalmente solo se aborda en las escalas de tiempo de configuración manual. El segundo desafío proviene del hecho de que los protocolos de enrutamiento actuales son bien conocidos por tener problemas de convergencia que no se adaptan a las limitaciones de tiempo impuestas por la migración en vivo. En tercer lugar, en el entorno de red de hoy en día, los cambios de conectividad del entorno de WAN generalmente son iniciados y controlados por operadores de red o sistemas de gestión de redes. Nuevamente, esto es poco adecuado para la migración del servidor WAN, donde es esencial que el software de migración, que está monitoreando de cerca el estado del proceso de migración del servidor, inicie este cambio en el momento apropiado. Nuestro enfoque para abordar los requisitos de red para la migración de WAN Live se basa en las observaciones de que no todos los cambios de red en este enfoque son críticos y además que los cambios instantáneos se logran mejor de manera localizada. Específicamente, en nuestra solución, descrita en detalle en la Sección 3, permitimos que el software de migración inicie los cambios de red necesarios tan pronto como se haya identificado la necesidad de migración. Hacemos uso de las tecnologías de túnel durante esta fase inicial para establecer preventivamente la conectividad entre los centros de datos involucrados. Una vez que se completa la migración del servidor, el software de migración inicia un cambio local para dirigir el tráfico hacia el nuevo centro de datos a través del túnel. Los cambios en la red de escala de tiempo más lento y luego eliminan este cambio de conectividad de red local para una ruta de red de red más óptima al nuevo centro de datos.2.3 Requisitos de replicación de almacenamiento La disponibilidad de datos generalmente se aborda replicando datos comerciales en un sistema de almacenamiento local/primario, hasta alguna ubicación remota desde donde se puede acceder. Desde un punto de vista comercial/de usabilidad, dicha replicación remota es impulsada por dos métricas [9]. El primer 263 es el objetivo de punto de recuperación, que es el punto de datos consistente al que los datos se pueden restaurar después de un desastre. El segundo es el objetivo de tiempo de recuperación, que es el tiempo que lleva recuperarse a ese punto de datos consistente después de un desastre [13]. La replicación remota se puede clasificar ampliamente en las siguientes dos categorías: ¡replicación sincrónica: cada bloque de datos escrito en un sistema de almacenamiento local se replica en la ubicación remota antes de que regrese la operación de escritura local.¡Replicación asincrónica: en este caso, los sistemas de almacenamiento locales y remotos pueden divergir. La cantidad de divergencia entre las copias locales y remotas generalmente está limitada por una cierta cantidad de datos o en un cierto período de tiempo. La replicación sincrónica se recomienda normalmente para aplicaciones, como bases de datos financieras, donde la consistencia entre los sistemas de almacenamiento locales y remotos es una alta prioridad. Sin embargo, estas propiedades deseables tienen un precio. Primero, debido a que cada bloque de datos debe replicarse de forma remota, los sistemas de replicación sincrónica no pueden beneficiarse de ninguna escritura local de datos si los mismos bloques de datos se escriben repetidamente [16]. En segundo lugar, debido a que los datos deben copiarse en la ubicación remota antes de que regrese la operación de escritura, la replicación sincrónica tiene un impacto de rendimiento directo en la aplicación, ya que tanto el rendimiento menor como el aumento de la latencia de la ruta entre los sistemas primarios y remotos se reflejan en eltiempo que se necesita para completar el disco local. Una alternativa es usar replicación asincrónica. Sin embargo, debido a que los sistemas locales y remotos pueden divergir, la replicación asincrónica siempre implica alguna pérdida de datos en caso de falla del sistema primario. Pero, debido a que las operaciones de escritura se pueden lanzar y canalizar los sistemas de replicación asincrónicos pueden mover datos a través de la red de una manera mucho más eficiente que los sistemas de replicación sincrónica. Para la migración del servidor WAN Live, buscamos un sistema de replicación más flexible donde el modo puede ser dictado por la semántica de migración. Específicamente, para admitir la migración del servidor en vivo, proponemos un sistema de replicación remota donde la transferencia inicial de datos entre los centros de datos se realiza mediante replicación asíncrona para beneficiarse de la eficiencia de ese modo de operación. Cuando la mayor parte de los datos se han transferido de esta manera, la replicación cambia a la replicación sincrónica en previsión de la finalización del paso de migración del servidor. El paso final de migración del servidor desencadena un conmutador simultáneo al sistema de almacenamiento en el nuevo centro de datos. De esta manera, cuando el servidor virtual comienza a ejecutarse en el nuevo centro de datos, los requisitos de almacenamiento se pueden cumplir localmente.3. Escenarios de migración de WAN En esta sección, ilustramos cómo nuestro enfoque cooperativo y consciente de contexto puede combinar los bloques de construcción técnicos descritos en la sección anterior para realizar la migración del servidor en vivo en una red de área amplia. Demostramos cómo la coordinación de las tecnologías de virtualización y migración del servidor, el subsistema de replicación de almacenamiento y la red pueden lograr la migración en vivo de todo el centro de datos en la WAN. Utilizamos diferentes escenarios para demostrar nuestro enfoque. En la Sección 3.1 describimos cómo nuestro enfoque se puede utilizar para lograr la migración segura en vivo de un centro de datos cuando se manejan los eventos de mantenimiento planificados. En la Sección 3.2 mostramos el uso de la migración del servidor en vivo para mitigar los efectos de las interrupciones o fallas no planificadas.3.1 Cabras de mantenimiento tratamos con interrupciones de mantenimiento en dos partes. Primero, consideramos el caso en el que el servicio no tiene requisitos de almacenamiento (o muy limitados). Este podría, por ejemplo, ser el caso con un elemento de red, como una puerta de enlace de voz-ip (VoIP). En segundo lugar, tratamos con el caso más general donde el servicio también requiere la migración del almacenamiento de datos al nuevo centro de datos. Sin exigir que se migren el almacenamiento: sin el almacenamiento, los componentes principales que necesitamos para coordinar son la migración del servidor y la movilidad de la red. La Figura 1 muestra el entorno donde la aplicación que se ejecuta en un servidor virtual vs debe moverse de un servidor físico en el centro de datos a a un servidor físico en el centro de datos B. Antes del evento de mantenimiento, el Sistema de Gestión de Migración de Coordinación (MMS) indicaría tanto al sistema de gestión del servidor como a la red de que una migración es inminente. El sistema de administración del servidor iniciaría la migración del servidor virtual desde el servidor físico A (¢ ¤ £ ¦ ¥) al servidor físico B (¢ ¤ £ ¦§). Después de una transferencia de estado a granel inicial como preparación para la migración, el sistema de administración del servidor reflejará cualquier cambio de estado entre los dos servidores virtuales. Del mismo modo, para la parte de la red, basada en la señal recibida del MMS, el enrutador del proveedor del proveedor de servicios (¢ © ¨) iniciará una serie de pasos para prepararse para la migración. Específicamente, como se muestra en la Figura 1 (b), el sistema de migración hará que la red cree un túnel entre ¢ © ¨ y ¢ © ¨ que se utilizará posteriormente para transferir datos destinados a Centro de datos B. Cuando el MMS determina un punto conveniente para detener el VS, se envía otra señal tanto al sistema de administración del servidor como a la red. Para el sistema de administración del servidor, esta señal indicará la migración final del VS desde el centro de datos A al centro de datos B, es decir, después de esto, el VS se activa en el centro de datos B. Para la red, esta segunda señal permite que la ruta de datos de la red se conmueva localmente a ¢ © ¨ © ¥ al centro de datos remoto. Específicamente, a partir de este momento, cualquier tráfico destinado a la dirección del servidor virtual que llega a ¢ © ¨ © ¥ se cambiará al túnel a ¢ © ¨ © § para la entrega al centro de datos B. Tenga en cuenta que en este punto, desde la perspectiva del servidor, la migración está completa ya que el VS ahora está activo en el centro de datos B. Sin embargo, el tráfico fluye subóptimamente primero a ¢ © ¨ © ¥ y luego a través del túnel a ¢ © ¨¤§. Para rectificar esta situación, está involucrado otro paso de redes. Específicamente, ¢ © ¨ © § comienza a anunciar una ruta más preferida para alcanzar VS, que la ruta que se anuncia actualmente por ¢ © ¨¤ ¥. De esta manera, como ingresar a la red (¢ © ¨¤ a ¢ © ¨¤ En la Figura 1) Reciba la ruta más preferida, el tráfico comenzará a fluir a ¢ © ¨ © § directamente y el túnel entre ¢ ©¨ © ¥ y ¢ © ¨ © § se puede derribar, lo que conduce al estado final que se muestra en la Figura 1 (c). Requerir migración de almacenamiento: cuando el almacenamiento también debe replicarse, es fundamental que logremos el equilibrio correcto entre el rendimiento (impacto en la aplicación) y el punto de recuperación o la pérdida de datos cuando el cambio se produce al centro de datos remoto. Para lograr esto, permitimos que el almacenamiento se replique de manera asincrónica, antes de cualquier inicio del evento de mantenimiento o, suponiendo que la cantidad de datos a transferir es relativamente pequeña, se puede iniciar una replicación asincrónica en anticipación de una migración que se espera quesuceder en breve. La replicación asincrónica durante esta fase inicial permite que la aplicación no vea un impacto en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, cuando el evento de mantenimiento es inminente, el MMS indicaría al sistema de replicación para cambiar de replicación asincrónica a replicación sincrónica para garantizar que no haya pérdida de datos durante la migración. Cuando los datos se replican sincrónicamente, habrá un impacto de rendimiento en la aplicación.264 Figura 1: Migración del servidor en vivo a través de una WAN Esto requiere que mantengamos la exposición al tiempo que replicamos de forma sincrónica al mínimo. Cuando el MMS señala al sistema de almacenamiento el requisito de cambiar a la replicación sincrónica, el sistema de almacenamiento completa todas las operaciones asíncronas pendientes y luego procede a realizar todas las escrituras posteriores replicándolo sincrónicamente al centro de datos remoto. Por lo tanto, entre la migración del servidor y la replicación sincrónica, tanto el estado de la aplicación como todas las operaciones de almacenamiento se reflejan en los dos entornos en los dos centros de datos. Cuando se copian todas las operaciones de escritura pendientes, como en el caso anterior, confiamos en la aplicación y se le indica que la red cambie el tráfico al centro de datos remoto. A partir de este momento, las operaciones de almacenamiento y migración del servidor se completan y se activan en el centro de datos B. Como se indicó anteriormente, el estado de la red aún debe actualizarse para garantizar un flujo de datos óptimo directamente al centro de datos B. Tenga en cuenta que si bien hemos descrito que el proceso de migración del servidor en vivo que involucra al proveedor de servicios para la parte de redes, es posible que un proveedor de centros de datos realice un conjunto similar de funciones sin involucrar al proveedor de servicios. Específicamente, al crear un túnel entre los enrutadores del borde del cliente (CE) en el centro de datos y realizar la conmutación local en el CE apropiado, en lugar de en el PE, el proveedor del centro de datos puede realizar la misma funcionalidad.3.2 Cottaciones no planificadas Proponemos usar también una migración cooperativa consciente del contexto para tratar con interrupciones de centros de datos no planificadas. Hay múltiples consideraciones que se destinan a administrar las operaciones del centro de datos para planificar y superar las fallas a través de la migración. Algunos de estos son: (1) cantidad de sobrecarga en funcionamiento normal para superar las fallas anticipadas;(2) cantidad de pérdida de datos asequible (objetivo de punto de recuperación - RPO);(3) cantidad de estado que debe migrarse;y (4) tiempo disponible desde la falla anticipada hasta el evento. En el extremo, uno podría incurrir en la sobrecarga de reflejar completamente la aplicación en el sitio remoto. Esto tiene la consecuencia de un procesamiento incurrente y sobrecarga de la red en funcionamiento normal, así como impactar el rendimiento de la aplicación (latencia y rendimiento) en todo momento. El otro extremo es solo garantizar la recuperación de datos e iniciar una nueva copia de la aplicación en el sitio remoto después de una interrupción. En este caso, se pierden el estado de memoria de aplicación, como las sesiones en curso, pero los datos almacenados en el disco se replican y están disponibles en un estado consistente. Ni este Estado en espera ni el enfoque de espera en frío descrito son deseables debido a la sobrecarga o la pérdida del estado de memoria de aplicación. Un enfoque intermedio es recuperar el control y el estado esencial de la aplicación, además de los datos almacenados en el disco, para minimizar aún más las interrupciones a los usuarios. Es posible un espectro de enfoques. En un servidor VoIP, por ejemplo, la información basada en la sesión se puede reflejar sin reflejar los datos que fluyen a través de cada sesión. En términos más generales, esto apunta a la necesidad de verificar algún estado de aplicación además de reflejar datos en el disco. El estado de la aplicación de la aplicación de control implica almacenar el estado de aplicación, ya sea periódicamente o de manera consciente de la aplicación como lo hacen las bases de datos y luego copiarlo en el sitio remoto. Por supuesto, esto tiene la consecuencia de que la aplicación se puede reiniciar de forma remota solo en el límite del punto de control. Del mismo modo, para el almacenamiento, uno puede usar una replicación asincrónica con una instantánea periódica que garantiza que todas las escrituras estén actualizadas en el sitio remoto en el momento del punto de control. Algunas pérdidas de datos pueden ocurrir en una falla catastrófica inesperada, pero el punto de recuperación puede ser bastante pequeño, dependiendo de la frecuencia de la aplicación de la aplicación y el estado de almacenamiento. La coordinación entre 265 el punto de control del estado de aplicación y la instantánea de almacenamiento es clave para la migración exitosa al tiempo que cumple con los RPO deseados. El punto de control incremental de la aplicación y el almacenamiento es clave para la eficiencia, y vemos técnicas existentes para lograr esto [4, 3, 11]. Por ejemplo, en lugar de la reflejo de la aplicación completa, una réplica virtualizada se puede mantener como un cálido inactivo en espera o hibernando que el estado que permite un interruptor rápido al estado de control previamente de control. Para hacer que el conmutador sin costura, además de replicar datos y estado de recuperación, se necesita soporte de red. Específicamente, al detectar la falta de disponibilidad del sitio primario, el sitio secundario se activa, y el mismo mecanismo descrito en la Sección 3.1 se utiliza para cambiar el tráfico para llegar al sitio secundario a través del túnel preestablecido. Tenga en cuenta que, por simplicidad de exposición, suponemos aquí que el PE que realiza el interruptor local no se ve afectado por la falla. Sin embargo, el enfoque se puede extender fácilmente para utilizar un cambio en un enrutador más profundo en la red. La cantidad de estado y almacenamiento que debe migrarse puede variar ampliamente de la aplicación a la aplicación. Puede haber muchas situaciones en las que, en principio, el servidor puede ser apátrate. Por ejemplo, un servidor proxy SIP puede no tener ningún estado persistente y la comunicación entre los clientes y el servidor proxy puede estar utilizando UDP. En tal caso, la actividad principal que se realizará está en la red para trasladar la comunicación al nuevo sitio del centro de datos. Se incurre poco o no sobre la sobrecarga en el funcionamiento normal para permitir la migración a un nuevo centro de datos. La recuperación de fallas no implica pérdida de datos y podemos lidiar con fallas casi instantáneas y catastróficas. A medida que se involucra más y más estado con el servidor, se incurre en más gastos generales en el estado de la aplicación del punto de control y potencialmente para tomar instantáneas de almacenamiento, ya sea periódicamente o a la solicitud de la aplicación. También significa que el RPO es una función del intervalo entre los puntos de control, cuando tenemos que lidiar con fallas instantáneas. Cuanta información más avanzada tengamos de una falla inminente, más efectivos podemos ser para que el estado migre al nuevo centro de datos, para que aún podamos tener un RPO más estricto cuando las operaciones se reanudan en el nuevo sitio.4. Trabajo relacionado El trabajo previo sobre este tema se divide en varias categorías: migración de máquinas virtuales, replicación de almacenamiento y soporte de red. En el núcleo de nuestra técnica está la capacidad de las aplicaciones encapsuladas dentro de las máquinas virtuales que se pueden migrar sin los tiempos de inactividad de la aplicación [15]. La mayoría del software de máquinas virtuales, como Xen [8] y VMware [14] admite la migración en vivo de máquinas virtuales que implican tiempos de inactividad extremadamente cortos que van desde decenas de milisegundos hasta un segundo;Los detalles de las técnicas de migración en vivo de XENS se discuten en [8]. Como se indicó anteriormente, estas técnicas suponen que la migración se está realizando en una LAN. La migración de VM también se ha estudiado en el sistema Shirako [10] y para entornos de cuadrícula [17, 19]. El software de máquina virtual actual admite una función de suspensión y currículum que se puede utilizar para admitir la migración de WAN, pero con tiempos de inactividad [18, 12]. Recientemente, la migración de WAN en vivo utilizando túneles IP se demostró en [21], donde se configura un túnel IP desde el servidor de origen a Destination para reenviar transparentemente los paquetes hacia y desde la aplicación;Abogamos por un enfoque alternativo que asume el soporte del enrutador de borde. En el contexto del almacenamiento, existen numerosos productos comerciales que realizan replicación, como la copia remota extendida de IBM, HP Continuous Access XP y el replista de EMC. En [11] se puede encontrar una excelente descripción de estos y otros, así como una taxonomía detallada de los diferentes enfoques para la replicación. El Sistema Menor URSA argumenta que ningún modelo de falla único es óptimo para todas las aplicaciones y propuesta de compra de selecciones específicas de datos de modelos de fallas y esquemas de codificación para la replicación [1]. Recientemente, propusimos la noción de replicación semántica [13] donde el sistema admite la replicación sincrónica y asincrónica simultáneamente y usa señales del sistema de archivos para determinar si replicar una escritura particular sincrónicamente y asincrónicamente. En el contexto del soporte de la red, nuestro trabajo está relacionado con el enfoque RouterFarm [2], que utiliza cambios de red orquestados para realizar un mantenimiento casi sin éxito en los enrutadores de borde del proveedor. Además de estar en un área de aplicación diferente, nuestro enfoque difiere del trabajo de RouterFarm en dos aspectos. Primero, proponemos que los cambios de red requeridos se activen por la funcionalidad fuera de la red (a diferencia de las funciones de gestión de la red dentro de la red). En segundo lugar, debido a los estrictos requisitos de tiempo de la migración en vivo, esperamos que nuestro enfoque requiera una nueva funcionalidad del enrutador (en lugar de ser realizable a través de las interfaces de configuración existentes). Finalmente, el trabajo informático orientado a la recuperación (ROC) enfatiza la recuperación de fallas en lugar de evitar fallas [6]. En un espíritu similar a ROC, abogamos por el uso de mecanismos desde la migración de VM en vivo hasta la replicación de almacenamiento para admitir interrupciones planificadas y no planificadas en los centros de datos (en lugar de una replicación completa para enmascarar tales fallas).5. Conclusión Una preocupación significativa para los proveedores de servicios basados en Internet es la operación continua y la disponibilidad de servicios frente a las interrupciones, ya sea planificada o no planificada. En este documento abogamos por un enfoque cooperativo y consciente de contexto para la migración del centro de datos a través de WAN para lidiar con interrupciones de manera no disruptiva. Intentamos lograr una alta disponibilidad de servicios de centros de datos frente a interrupciones planificadas e incidentales de las instalaciones de centros de datos. Abogamos a usar tecnologías de virtualización del servidor para habilitar la replicación y la migración de las funciones del servidor. Propusimos nuevas funciones de red para habilitar la migración y replicación del servidor en redes de área amplia (como Internet o una red privada virtual distribuida geográficamente), y finalmente mostró la utilidad de la tecnología de replicación de almacenamiento inteligente y dinámica para garantizar que las aplicaciones tengan acceso a datos en elcara de interrupciones con objetivos de punto de recuperación muy estrictos.6.

        "INTRODUCTION A significant concern for Internet-based service providers is the continued operation and availability of services in the face of outages, whether planned or unplanned.",
        "These concerns are exacerbated by the increased use of the Internet for mission critical business and real-time entertainment applications.",
        "A relatively minor outage can disrupt and inconvenience a large number of users.",
        "Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers.",
        "Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.",
        "In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
        "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
        "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
        "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
        "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
        "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
        "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",
        "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",
        "In this paper we outline a design for live service migration across WANs.",
        "Our design makes use of existing server virtualization technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate migration across a WAN.",
        "The essence of our approach is cooperative, context aware migration, where a migration management system orchestrates the data center migration across all three subsystems involved, namely the server platforms, the wide area network and the disk storage system.",
        "While conceptually similar in nature to the LAN based work described above, using migration technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has to our knowledge not been achieved.",
        "Our main contribution is the design of a framework that will allow the migration across a WAN of all subsystems involved with enabling data center services.",
        "We describe new mechanisms as well as extensions to existing technologies to enable this and outline the cooperative, context aware functionality needed across the different subsystems to enable this. 262 2.",
        "LIVE DATA CENTER MIGRATION ACROSS WANS Three essential subsystems are involved with hosting services in a data center: First, the servers host the application or service logic.",
        "Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs).",
        "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
        "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
        "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
        "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
        "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
        "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
        "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
        "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
        "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
        "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
        "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
        "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
        "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
        "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
        "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
        "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
        "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
        "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
        "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
        "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
        "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
        "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
        "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
        "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
        "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
        "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
        "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
        "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
        "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
        "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
        "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
        "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
        "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
        "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
        "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
        "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
        "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
        "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
        "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
        "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
        "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
        "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
        "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
        "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
        "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
        "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
        "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
        "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
        "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
        "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
        "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
        "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
        "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
        "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
        "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
        "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
        "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
        "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
        "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
        "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
        "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
        "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
        "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
        "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
        "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
        "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
        "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
        "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
        "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
        "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
        "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
        "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
        "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
        "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
        "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
        "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
        "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
        "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
        "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
        "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
        "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
        "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
        "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
        "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
        "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
        "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
        "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
        "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
        "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
        "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
        "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
        "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
        "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
        "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
        "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
        "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
        "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
        "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
        "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
        "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
        "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
        "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
        "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
        "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
        "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
        "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
        "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
        "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
        "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
        "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
        "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
        "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
        "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
        "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
        "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
        "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
        "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
        "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
        "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
        "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
        "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support.",
        "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
        "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
        "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
        "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
        "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
        "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",
        "In the context of storage, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor.",
        "An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11].",
        "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
        "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
        "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
        "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
        "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
        "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
        "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
        "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",
        "CONCLUSION A significant concern for Internet-based service providers is the continued operation and availability of services in the face of outages, whether planned or unplanned.",

                "A relatively minor outage can disrupt and inconvenience a large number of users.",
                "Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers.",
                "Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.",
                "In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",
                "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",
                "In this paper we outline a design for live service migration across WANs.",
                "Our design makes use of existing server virtualization technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate migration across a WAN.",
                "The essence of our approach is cooperative, context aware migration, where a migration management system orchestrates the data center migration across all three subsystems involved, namely the server platforms, the wide area network and the disk storage system.",
                "While conceptually similar in nature to the LAN based work described above, using migration technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has to our knowledge not been achieved.",
                "Our main contribution is the design of a framework that will allow the migration across a WAN of all subsystems involved with enabling data center services.",
                "We describe new mechanisms as well as extensions to existing technologies to enable this and outline the cooperative, context aware functionality needed across the different subsystems to enable this. 262 2.",
                "LIVE DATA CENTER MIGRATION ACROSS WANS Three essential subsystems are involved with hosting services in a data center: First, the servers host the application or service logic.",
                "Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs).",
                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",
                "In the context of storage, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor.",
                "An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11].",
                "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
                "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
                "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",

                "Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers.",
                "Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.",
                "In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",
                "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live <br>data center migration</br>, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",
                "In this paper we outline a design for live service migration across WANs.",
                "Our design makes use of existing server virtualization technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate migration across a WAN.",
                "The essence of our approach is cooperative, context aware migration, where a migration management system orchestrates the <br>data center migration</br> across all three subsystems involved, namely the server platforms, the wide area network and the disk storage system.",
                "While conceptually similar in nature to the LAN based work described above, using migration technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has to our knowledge not been achieved.",
                "Our main contribution is the design of a framework that will allow the migration across a WAN of all subsystems involved with enabling data center services.",

                "LIVE <br>data center migration</br> ACROSS WANS Three essential subsystems are involved with hosting services in a data center: First, the servers host the application or service logic.",
                "Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs).",
                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",

                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",
                "In the context of storage, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor.",
                "An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11].",
                "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
                "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
                "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",

                "These concerns are exacerbated by the increased use of the Internet for mission critical business and real-time entertainment applications.",
                "A relatively minor outage can disrupt and inconvenience a large number of users.",
                "Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers.",
                "Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.",
                "In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (<br>wan</br>), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a <br>wan</br> environment.",
                "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",
                "In this paper we outline a design for live service migration across WANs.",
                "Our design makes use of existing server virtualization technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate migration across a <br>wan</br>.",
                "The essence of our approach is cooperative, context aware migration, where a migration management system orchestrates the data center migration across all three subsystems involved, namely the server platforms, the wide area network and the disk storage system.",
                "While conceptually similar in nature to the LAN based work described above, using migration technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has to our knowledge not been achieved.",
                "Our main contribution is the design of a framework that will allow the migration across a <br>wan</br> of all subsystems involved with enabling data center services.",
                "We describe new mechanisms as well as extensions to existing technologies to enable this and outline the cooperative, context aware functionality needed across the different subsystems to enable this. 262 2.",
                "LIVE DATA CENTER MIGRATION ACROSS WANS Three essential subsystems are involved with hosting services in a data center: First, the servers host the application or service logic.",
                "Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs).",
                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (<br>wan</br>).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use <br>wan</br> server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a <br>wan</br> is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays <br>wan</br> networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to <br>wan</br> server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live <br>wan</br> migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For <br>wan</br> live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "<br>wan</br> MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the <br>wan</br>.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a <br>wan</br> This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support <br>wan</br> migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live <br>wan</br> migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",
                "In the context of storage, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor.",
                "An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11].",
                "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
                "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",

                "In the <br>lan</br> environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a <br>lan</br> environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a <br>lan</br> environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared <br>lan</br> environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",

                "LIVE DATA CENTER MIGRATION ACROSS WANS Three essential subsystems are involved with hosting services in a data center: First, the servers host the application or service logic.",
                "Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs).",
                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant <br>lan</br> devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a <br>lan</br> environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-<br>lan</br> environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the <br>lan</br> environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with <br>lan</br> based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a <br>lan</br>.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",
                "In the context of storage, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor.",
                "An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11].",
                "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
                "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
                "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",

                "A relatively minor outage can disrupt and inconvenience a large number of users.",
                "Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers.",
                "Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.",
                "In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a <br>virtual server</br>, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a <br>virtual server</br> to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the <br>virtual server</br> retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the <br>virtual server</br> to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",
                "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",
                "In this paper we outline a design for live service migration across WANs.",
                "Our design makes use of existing server virtualization technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate migration across a WAN.",
                "The essence of our approach is cooperative, context aware migration, where a migration management system orchestrates the data center migration across all three subsystems involved, namely the server platforms, the wide area network and the disk storage system.",
                "While conceptually similar in nature to the LAN based work described above, using migration technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has to our knowledge not been achieved.",
                "Our main contribution is the design of a framework that will allow the migration across a WAN of all subsystems involved with enabling data center services.",
                "We describe new mechanisms as well as extensions to existing technologies to enable this and outline the cooperative, context aware functionality needed across the different subsystems to enable this. 262 2.",
                "LIVE DATA CENTER MIGRATION ACROSS WANS Three essential subsystems are involved with hosting services in a data center: First, the servers host the application or service logic.",
                "Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs).",
                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live <br>virtual server</br> Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a <br>virtual server</br> is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the <br>virtual server</br> is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the <br>virtual server</br> experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the <br>virtual server</br> has to be reachable at the physical server where the <br>virtual server</br> is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the <br>virtual server</br> to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, <br>virtual server</br> migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the <br>virtual server</br> be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the <br>virtual server</br> starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a <br>virtual server</br> VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the <br>virtual server</br> from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the <br>virtual server</br> address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",
                "In the context of storage, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor.",
                "An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11].",
                "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
                "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
                "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",
                "CONCLUSION A significant concern for Internet-based service providers is the continued operation and availability of services in the face of outages, whether planned or unplanned.",
                "In this paper we advocated a cooperative, context-aware approach to data center migration across WANs to deal with outages in a non-disruptive manner.",
                "We sought to achieve high availability of data center services in the face of both planned and incidental outages of data center facilities.",

                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",

                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 <br>storage replication</br> Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the <br>storage replication</br> subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, <br>storage replication</br> and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",

                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",

                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
                "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to <br>storage replication</br> to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",

                "Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers.",
                "Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.",
                "In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",
                "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",

                "Our design makes use of existing server virtualization technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate migration across a WAN.",

                "Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs).",
                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ <br>synchronous replication</br>: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "<br>synchronous replication</br> is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, <br>synchronous replication</br> systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, <br>synchronous replication</br> has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than <br>synchronous replication</br> systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to <br>synchronous replication</br> in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to <br>synchronous replication</br> to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to <br>synchronous replication</br>, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and <br>synchronous replication</br>, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",
                "In the context of storage, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor.",
                "An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11].",
                "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
                "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
                "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",

                "In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",
                "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",

                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ <br>asynchronous replication</br>: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use <br>asynchronous replication</br>.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, <br>asynchronous replication</br> always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, <br>asynchronous replication</br> systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via <br>asynchronous replication</br> to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, <br>asynchronous replication</br> can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "<br>asynchronous replication</br> during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from <br>asynchronous replication</br> to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use <br>asynchronous replication</br> with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",

                "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and <br>asynchronous replication</br> concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
                "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
                "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",

                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",
                "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",

                "Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs).",
                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, <br>network support</br> is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and <br>network support</br>.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",
                "In the context of storage, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor.",
                "An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11].",
                "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of <br>network support</br>, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
                "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
                "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",

                "Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers.",
                "Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.",
                "In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, <br>storage</br> requirements are normally met via either network attached <br>storage</br> (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",
                "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",

                "While conceptually similar in nature to the LAN based work described above, using migration technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has to our knowledge not been achieved.",

                "LIVE DATA CENTER MIGRATION ACROSS WANS Three essential subsystems are involved with hosting services in a data center: First, the servers host the application or service logic.",
                "Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs).",
                "Finally, most applications require disk <br>storage</br> for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the <br>storage</br> level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and <br>storage</br> subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk <br>storage</br> needs are being met with network attached <br>storage</br> (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) <br>storage</br> including <br>storage</br> area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 <br>storage</br> Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary <br>storage</br> system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local <br>storage</br> system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote <br>storage</br> systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote <br>storage</br> systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the <br>storage</br> system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, <br>storage</br> requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the <br>storage</br> replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) <br>storage</br> requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data <br>storage</br> to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring <br>storage</br> to be Migrated: Without <br>storage</br> to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring <br>storage</br> Migration: When <br>storage</br> has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the <br>storage</br> to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the <br>storage</br> system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the <br>storage</br> system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the <br>storage</br> operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both <br>storage</br> and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for <br>storage</br> one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and <br>storage</br> state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of <br>storage</br> is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and <br>storage</br> is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and <br>storage</br> that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take <br>storage</br> snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, <br>storage</br> replication and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",
                "In the context of <br>storage</br>, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor.",
                "An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11].",
                "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
                "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
                "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to <br>storage</br> replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",

                "A relatively minor outage can disrupt and inconvenience a large number of users.",
                "Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers.",
                "Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.",
                "In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",
                "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",
                "In this paper we outline a design for live service migration across WANs.",
                "Our design makes use of existing server virtualization technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate migration across a WAN.",
                "The essence of our approach is cooperative, context aware migration, where a migration management system orchestrates the data center migration across all three subsystems involved, namely the server platforms, the wide area network and the disk storage system.",
                "While conceptually similar in nature to the LAN based work described above, using migration technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has to our knowledge not been achieved.",
                "Our main contribution is the design of a framework that will allow the migration across a WAN of all subsystems involved with enabling data center services.",

                "LIVE DATA CENTER MIGRATION ACROSS WANS Three essential subsystems are involved with hosting services in a data center: First, the servers host the application or service logic.",
                "Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs).",
                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a <br>voice-over-ip</br> (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",
                "In the context of storage, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor.",
                "An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11].",
                "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
                "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
                "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",

                "A relatively minor outage can disrupt and inconvenience a large number of users.",
                "Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers.",
                "Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.",
                "In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",
                "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",
                "In this paper we outline a design for live service migration across WANs.",
                "Our design makes use of existing server virtualization technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate migration across a WAN.",

                "While conceptually similar in nature to the LAN based work described above, using migration technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has to our knowledge not been achieved.",

                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",

                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial databases, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (<br>voip</br>) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a <br>voip</br> server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",

                "These concerns are exacerbated by the increased use of the Internet for mission critical business and real-time entertainment applications.",
                "A relatively minor outage can disrupt and inconvenience a large number of users.",
                "Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers.",
                "Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.",
                "In the LAN environment, these technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.",
                "Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the physical servers in a data center [22].",
                "When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.",
                "In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level interactions are not disrupted.",
                "Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.",
                "Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.",
                "While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.",
                "Second, while fairly sophisticated remote replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.",
                "In this paper we outline a design for live service migration across WANs.",
                "Our design makes use of existing server virtualization technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate migration across a WAN.",
                "The essence of our approach is cooperative, context aware migration, where a migration management system orchestrates the data center migration across all three subsystems involved, namely the server platforms, the wide area network and the disk storage system.",
                "While conceptually similar in nature to the LAN based work described above, using migration technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has to our knowledge not been achieved.",
                "Our main contribution is the design of a framework that will allow the migration across a WAN of all subsystems involved with enabling data center services.",
                "We describe new mechanisms as well as extensions to existing technologies to enable this and outline the cooperative, context aware functionality needed across the different subsystems to enable this. 262 2.",
                "LIVE DATA CENTER MIGRATION ACROSS WANS Three essential subsystems are involved with hosting services in a data center: First, the servers host the application or service logic.",
                "Second, services are normally hosted in a data center to provide shared access through a network, either the Internet or virtual private networks (VPNs).",
                "Finally, most applications require disk storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency of access varies greatly between different services/applications.",
                "Disruptions, failures, or in general, outages of any kind of any of these components will cause service disruption.",
                "For this reason, prior work and current practices have addressed the robustness of individual components.",
                "For example, data centers typically have multiple network connections and redundant LAN devices to ensure redundancy at the networking level.",
                "Similarly, physical servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable components (disks, processor blades, power supplies etc).",
                "Finally, redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated data mirroring technologies.",
                "The focus of our work, however, is on the case where such local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient.",
                "Specifically, we are interested in providing service availability when the data center as a whole becomes unavailable, for example because of data center wide maintenance operations, or because of catastrophic events.",
                "As such, our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers across the wide are network (WAN).",
                "By necessity, moving or migrating services from one data center to another needs to consider all three of these components.",
                "Historically, such migration has been disruptive in nature, requiring downtime of the actual services involved, or requiring heavy weight replication techniques.",
                "In the latter case concurrently running replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the service as a whole.",
                "We argue that these existing mechanisms are inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services, including real-time services, in terms of continuous availability and operation.",
                "Instead, we advocate an approach where server, network and storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions, in a manner that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless migration across wide area networks.",
                "In this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks that would enable our approach.",
                "As outlined below, some of these building blocks exist, or exist in part, while in other cases we use the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the changes we are proposing. 2.1 Live Virtual Server Migration The main enabler for our approach is the live server migration capabilities that have been developed in the context of server virtualization in recent years [5, 8].",
                "In this approach an entire running operating system (including any active applications) executing as a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to another.",
                "Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.",
                "Assuming that network level reachability to the virtual servers network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.",
                "In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.",
                "In a LAN environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited ARP reply to establish the binding between the new MAC address and the IP address, or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual server to reuse its (old) MAC address [8].",
                "Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN environments [22].",
                "However, virtual server migration across the wide area will also be an attractive tool, specifically to deal with outages, and therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this.",
                "If disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage (NAS), the storage becomes just another network based application and can therefore be addressed in the same way with LAN based migration [8].",
                "Modern virtualization environments also include support for other forms of (local) storage including storage area networks (SANs) [23].",
                "However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime. 2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.",
                "This presents a significant challenge for a number of reasons.",
                "First, despite decades of work in this area, IP address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales.",
                "The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.",
                "Third, in todays WAN networking environment connectivity changes are typically initiated, and controlled, by network operators or network management systems.",
                "Again this is poorly suited to WAN server migration where it is essential that the migration software, which is closely monitoring the status of the server migration process, initiate this change at the appropriate time.",
                "Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.",
                "Specifically, in our solution, described in detail in Section 3, we allow the migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as soon as the need for migration has been identified.",
                "We make use of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively establish connectivity between the data centers involved.",
                "Once server migration is complete, the migration software initiates a local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the tunnel.",
                "Slower time scale network changes then phase out this local network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path to the new data center. 2.3 Storage Replication Requirements Data availability is typically addressed by replicating business data on a local/primary storage system, to some remote location from where it can be accessed.",
                "From a business/usability point of view, such remote replication is driven by two metrics [9].",
                "First 263 is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to which data can be restored after a disaster.",
                "Second is the recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent data point after a disaster [13].",
                "Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ¡ Synchronous replication: every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to the remote location before the local write operation returns. ¡ Asynchronous replication: in this case the local and remote storage systems are allowed to diverge.",
                "The amount of divergence between the local and remote copies is typically bounded by either a certain amount of data, or by a certain amount of time.",
                "Synchronous replication is normally recommended for applications, such as financial <br>database</br>s, where consistency between local and remote storage systems is a high priority.",
                "However, these desirable properties come at a price.",
                "First, because every data block needs to be replicated remotely, synchronous replication systems can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same data blocks are written repeatedly [16].",
                "Second, because data have to be copied to the remote location before the write operation returns, synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on the application, since both lower throughput and increased latency of the path between the primary and the remote systems are reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete.",
                "An alternative is to use asynchronous replication.",
                "However, because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge, asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a failure of the primary system.",
                "But, because write operations can be batched and pipelined, asynchronous replication systems can move data across the network in a much more efficient manner than synchronous replication systems.",
                "For WAN live server migration we seek a more flexible replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration semantics.",
                "Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.",
                "When the bulk of the data have been transfered in this manner, replication switches to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the server migration step.",
                "The final server migration step triggers a simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data center.",
                "In this manner, when the virtual server starts executing in the new data center, storage requirements can be locally met. 3.",
                "WAN MIGRATION SCENARIOS In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.",
                "We demonstrate how the coordination of server virtualization and migration technologies, the storage replication subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data center across the WAN.",
                "We utilize different scenarios to demonstrate our approach.",
                "In Section 3.1 we outline how our approach can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when planned maintenance events are handled.",
                "In Section 3.2 we show the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned outages or failures. 3.1 Maintenance Outages We deal with maintenance outages in two parts.",
                "First, we consider the case where the service has no (or very limited) storage requirements.",
                "This might for example be the case with a network element such as a voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateway.",
                "Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the migration of data storage to the new data center.",
                "Without Requiring Storage to be Migrated: Without storage to be replicated, the primary components that we need to coordinate are the server migration and network mobility.",
                "Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B.",
                "Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.",
                "The server management system would initiate the migration of the virtual server from physical server a (¢¤£¦¥ ) to physical server b (¢¤£¦§ ).",
                "After an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for migration, the server management system will mirror any state changes between the two virtual servers.",
                "Similarly, for the network part, based on the signal received from the MMS, the service provider edge (¢©¨ ) router will initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration.",
                "Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨\u0011\u0010 and ¢©¨\u0013\u0012 which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.",
                "When the MMS determines a convenient point to quiesce the VS, another signal is sent to both the server management system and the network.",
                "For the server management system, this signal will indicate the final migration of the VS from data center A to data center B, i.e., after this the VS will become active in data center B.",
                "For the network, this second signal enables the network data path to switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center.",
                "Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B.",
                "Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.",
                "However, traffic is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel to ¢©¨¤§ .",
                "To rectify this situation another networking step is involved.",
                "Specifically, ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route to reach VS, than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ .",
                "In this manner, as ingress PEs to the network (¢©¨¤\u0014 to ¢©¨¤\u0015 in Figure 1) receive the more preferred route, traffic will start to flow to ¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn down leading to the final state shown in Figure 1(c).",
                "Requiring Storage Migration: When storage has to also be replicated, it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance (impact on the application) and the recovery point or data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center.",
                "To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is expected to happen shortly.",
                "Asynchronous replication during this initial phase allows for the application to see no performance impact.",
                "However, when the maintenance event is imminent, the MMS would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no loss of data during migration.",
                "When data is being replicated synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application. 264 Figure 1: Live server migration across a WAN This requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum.",
                "When the MMS signals to the storage system the requirement to switch to synchronous replication, the storage system completes all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to the remote data center.",
                "Thus, between the server migration and synchronous replication, both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data centers.",
                "When all the pending write operations are copied over, then as in the previous case, we quiesce the application and the network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center.",
                "From this point on, both storage and server migration operations are complete and activated in data center B.",
                "As above, the network state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly to data center B.",
                "Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.",
                "Specifically, by creating a tunnel between the customer edge (CE) routers in the data center, and performing local switching on the appropriate CE, rather than on the PE, the data center provider can realize the same functionality. 3.2 Unplanned Outages We propose to also use cooperative, context aware migration to deal with unplanned data center outages.",
                "There are multiple considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan and overcome failures through migration.",
                "Some of these are: (1) amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome anticipated failures; (2) amount of data loss affordable (recovery point objective - RPO); (3) amount of state that has to be migrated; and (4) time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event.",
                "At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.",
                "This has the consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under normal operation as well as impacting application performance (latency and throughput) throughout.",
                "The other extreme is to only ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the remote site after an outage.",
                "In this case, application memory state such as ongoing sessions are lost, but data stored on disk is replicated and available in a consistent state.",
                "Neither this hot standby nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the overhead or the loss of application memory state.",
                "An intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state of the application, in addition to data stored on disk, to further minimize disruptions to users.",
                "A spectrum of approaches are possible.",
                "In a VoIP server, for instance, session-based information can be mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session.",
                "More generally, this points to the need to checkpoint some application state in addition to mirroring data on disk.",
                "Checkpointing application state involves storing application state either periodically or in an application-aware manner like <br>database</br>s do and then copying it to the remote site.",
                "Of course, this has the consequence that the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint boundary only.",
                "Similarly, for storage one may use asynchronous replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date at the remote site at the time of checkpointing.",
                "Some data loss may occur upon an unanticipated, catastrophic failure, but the recovery point may be fairly small, depending on the frequency of checkpointing application and storage state.",
                "Coordination between 265 the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired RPOs.",
                "Incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to efficiency, and we see existing techniques to achieve this [4, 3, 11].",
                "For instance, rather than full application mirroring, a virtualized replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously checkpointed state.",
                "To make the switch-over seamless, in addition to replicating data and recovering state, network support is needed.",
                "Specifically, on detecting the unavailability of the primary site, the secondary site is made active, and the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary site via the pre-established tunnel.",
                "Note that for simplicity of exposition we assume here that the PE that performs the local switch over is not affected by the failure.",
                "The approach can however, easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in the network.",
                "The amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary widely from application to application.",
                "There may be many situations where, in principle, the server can be stateless.",
                "For example, a SIP proxy server may not have any persistent state and the communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using UDP.",
                "In such a case, the primary activity to be performed is in the network to move the communication over to the new data center site.",
                "Little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to enable the migration to a new data center.",
                "Failure recovery involves no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous, catastrophic failures.",
                "As more and more state is involved with the server, more overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially to take storage snapshots, either periodically or upon application prompting.",
                "It also means that the RPO is a function of the interval between checkpoints, when we have to deal with instantaneous failures.",
                "The more advanced information we have of an impending failure, the more effective we can be in having the state migrated over to the new data center, so that we can still have a tighter RPO when operations are resumed at the new site. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK Prior work on this topic falls into several categories: virtual machine migration, storage replication and network support.",
                "At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without application downtimes [15].",
                "Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xens live migration techniques are discussed in [8].",
                "As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.",
                "VM migration has also been studied in the Shirako system [10] and for grid environments [17, 19].",
                "Current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume feature that can be used to support WAN migration, but with downtimes [18, 12].",
                "Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.",
                "In the context of storage, there exist numerous commercial products that perform replication, such as IBM Extended Remote Copy, HP Continuous Access XP, and EMC RepliStor.",
                "An excellent description of these and others, as well as a detailed taxonomy of the different approaches for replication can be found in [11].",
                "The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections of fault models and encoding schemes for replication [1].",
                "Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.",
                "In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.",
                "In addition to being in a different application area, our approach differs from the RouterFarm work in two regards.",
                "First, we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by functionality outside of the network (as opposed to network management functions inside the network).",
                "Second, due to the stringent timing requirements of live migration, we expect that our approach would require new router functionality (as opposed to being realizable via the existing configuration interfaces).",
                "Finally, the recovery oriented computing (ROC) work emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance [6].",
                "In a similar spirit to ROC, we advocate using mechanisms from live VM migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned outages in data centers (rather than full replication to mask such failures). 5.",
                "CONCLUSION A significant concern for Internet-based service providers is the continued operation and availability of services in the face of outages, whether planned or unplanned.",
                "In this paper we advocated a cooperative, context-aware approach to data center migration across WANs to deal with outages in a non-disruptive manner.",
                "We sought to achieve high availability of data center services in the face of both planned and incidental outages of data center facilities.",
                "We advocated using server virtualization technologies to enable the replication and migration of server functions.",
                "We proposed new network functions to enable server migration and replication across wide area networks (such as the Internet or a geographically distributed virtual private network), and finally showed the utility of intelligent and dynamic storage replication technology to ensure applications have access to data in the face of outages with very tight recovery point objectives. 6.",
