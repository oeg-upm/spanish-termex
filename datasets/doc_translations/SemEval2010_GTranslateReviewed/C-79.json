INTRODUCTION Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) consist of mobile nodes that autonomously establish connectivity via multi-hop wireless communications. Without relying on any existing, pre-configured network infrastructure or centralized control, MANETs are useful in situations where impromptu communication facilities are required, such as battlefield communications and disaster relief missions. As MANET applications demand collaborative processing and information sharing among mobile nodes, resource (service) discovery and distribution have become indispensable capabilities. One approach to designing resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs is to construct a peer-to-peer (P2P) system (or an overlay) which organizes peers of the system into a logical structure, on top of the actual network topology. However, deploying such P2P systems over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the reactive routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth utilization in proactive routing schemes. Either way, constructing an overlay will potentially create a scalability problem for large-scale MANETs. Due to the dynamic nature of MANETs, P2P systems should be robust by being scalable and adaptive to topology changes. These systems should also provide efficient and effective ways for peers to interact, as well as other desirable application specific features. This paper describes a design paradigm that uses the following two functional primitives to design robust resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs. 1. Positive/negative feedback. Query packets are used to explore a route to other peers holding resources of interest. Optionally, advertisement packets are sent out to advertise routes from other peers about available resources. When traversing a route, these control packets measure goodness of the route and leave feedback information on each node along the way to guide subsequent control packets to appropriate directions. 2. Sporadic random walk. As the network topology and/or the availability of resources change, existing routes may become stale while better routes become available. Sporadic random walk allows a control packet to explore different paths and opportunistically discover new and/or better routes. Adopting this paradigm, the whole MANET P2P system operates as a collection of autonomous entities which consist of different types of control packets such as query and advertisement packets. These packets work collaboratively, but indirectly, to achieve common tasks, such as resource discovery, routing, and load balancing. With collaboration among these entities, a MANET P2P system is able to learn the network dynamics by itself and adjust its behavior accordingly, without the overhead of organizing peers into an overlay. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Related work is described in the next section. Section 3 describes the resource discovery scheme. Section 4 describes the resource distribution scheme. The replica invalidation scheme is described in Section 5, followed by it performance evaluation in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper. 2. RELATED WORK For MANETs, P2P systems can be classified based on the design principle, into layered and cross-layer approaches. A layered approach adopts a P2P-like [1] solution, where resource discovery is facilitated as an application layer protocol and query/reply messages are delivered by the underlying MANET routing protocols. For instance, Konark [2] makes use of a underlying multicast protocol such that service providers and queriers advertise and search services via a predefined multicast group, respectively. Proem [3] is a high-level mobile computing platform for P2P systems over MANETs. It defines a transport protocol that sits on top of the existing TCP/IP stack, hence relying on an existing routing protocol to operate. With limited control over how control and data packets are routed in the network, it is difficult to avoid the inefficiency of the general-purpose routing protocols which are often reactive and flooding-based. In contrast, cross-layer approaches either relies on its own routing mechanism or augments existing MANET routing algorithms to support resource discovery. 7DS [4], which is the pioneering work deploying P2P system on mobile devices, exploits data locality and node mobility to dissemination data in a single-hop fashion. Hence, long search latency may be resulted as a 7DS node can get data of interest only if the node that holds the data is in its radio coverage. Mohan et al. [5] propose an adaptive service discovery algorithm that combines both push and pull models. Specifically, a service provider/querier broadcasts advertisement/query only when the number of nodes advertising or querying, which is estimated by received control packets, is below a threshold during a period of time. In this way, the number of control packets on the network is constrained, thus providing good scalability. Despite the mechanism to reduce control packets, high overhead may still be unavoidable, especially when there are many clients trying to locate different services, due to the fact that the algorithm relies on flooding, For resource replication, Yin and Cao [6] design and evaluate cooperative caching techniques for MANETs. Caching, however, is performed reactively by intermediate nodes when a querier requests data from a server. Data items or resources are never pushed into other nodes proactively. Thanedar et al. [7] propose a lightweight content replication scheme using an expanding ring technique. If a server detects the number of requests exceed a threshold within a time period, it begins to replicate its data onto nodes capable of storing replicas, whose hop counts from the server are of certain values. Since data replication is triggered by the request frequency alone, it is possible that there are replicas unnecessarily created in a large scope even though only nodes within a small range request this data. Our proposed resource replication mechanism, in contrast, attempts to replicate a data item in appropriate areas, instead of a large area around the server, where the item is requested frequently. 3. RESOURCE DISCOVERY We propose a cross-layer, hybrid resource discovery scheme that relies on the multiple interactions of query, reply and advertisement packets. We assume that each resource is associated with a unique ID1 . Initially, when a node wants to discover a resource, it deploys query packets, which carry the corresponding resource ID, and randomly explore the network to search for the requested resource. Upon receiving such a query packet, a reply packet is generated by the node providing the requested resource. Advertisement packets can also be used to proactively inform other nodes about what resources are available at each node. In addition to discovering the identity of the node providing the requested resource, it may be also necessary to discover a route leading to this node for further interaction. To allow intermediate nodes to make a decision on where to forward query packets, each node maintains two tables: neighbor 1 The assumption of unique ID is made for brevity in exposition, and resources could be specified via attribute-value assertions. table and pheromone table. The neighbor table maintains a list of all current neighbors obtained via a neighbor discovery protocol. The pheromone table maintains the mapping of a resource ID and a neighbor ID to a pheromone value. This table is initially empty, and is updated by a reply packet generated by a successful query. Figure 1 illustrates an example of a neighbor table and a pheromone table maintained by node A having four neighbors. When node A receives a query packet searching for a resource, it makes a decision to which neighbor it should forward the query packet by computing the desirability of each of the neighbors that have not been visited before by the same query packet. For a resource ID r, the desirability of choosing a neighbor n, δ(r,n), is obtained from the pheromone value of the entry whose neighbor and resource ID fields are n and r, respectively. If no such entry exists in the pheromone table, δ(r,n) is set to zero. Once the desirabilities of all valid next hops have been calculated, they are normalized to obtain the probability of choosing each neighbor. In addition, a small probability is also assigned to those neighbors with zero desirability to exercise the sporadic random walk primitive. Based on these probabilities, a next hop is selected to forward the query packet to. When a query packet encounters a node with a satisfying resource, a reply packet is returned to the querying node. The returning reply packet also updates the pheromone table at each node on its return trip by increasing the pheromone value in the entry whose resource ID and neighbor ID fields match the ID of the discovered resource and the previous hop, respectively. If such an entry does not exist, a new entry is added into the table. Therefore, subsequent query packets looking for the same resource, when encountering this pheromone information, are then guided toward the same destination with a small probability of taking an alternate path. Since the hybrid discovery scheme neither relies on a MANET routing protocol nor arranges nodes into a logical overlay, query packets are to traverse the actual network topology. In dense networks, relatively large nodal degrees can have potential impacts on this random exploring mechanism. To address this issue, the hybrid scheme also incorporates proactive advertisement in addition to the reactive query. To perform proactive advertisement, each node periodically deploys an advertising packet containing a list of its available resources IDs. These packets will traverse away from the advertising node in a random walk manner up to a limited number of hops and advertise resource information to surrounding nodes in the same way as reply packets. In the hybrid scheme, an increase of pheromone serves as a positive feedback which indirectly guides query packets looking for similar resources. Intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well. Each node also performs an implicit negative feedback for resources that have not been given a positive feedback for some time by regularly decreasing the pheromone in all of its pheromone table entries over time. In addition, pheromone can be reduced by an explicit negative response, for instance, a reply packet returning from a node that is not willing to provide a resource due to excessive workload. As a result, load balancing can be achieved via positive and negative feedback. A node serving too many nodes can either return fewer responses to query packets or generate negative responses. 2 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 Figure 1: Example illustrating neighbor and pheromone tables maintained by node A: (a) wireless connectivity around A showing that it currently has four neighbors, (b) As neighbor table, and (c) a possible pheromone table of A Figure 2: Sample scenarios illustrating the three mechanisms supporting load-balancing: (a) resource replication, (b) resource relocation, and (c) resource division 4. RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION In addition to resource discovery, a querying node usually attempts to access and retrieve the contents of a resource after a successful discovery. In certain situations, it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the resource can be relocated and/or replicated, such as data files. Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well. Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers. An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away. In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas. For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a). To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource. A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself. Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone. When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back. The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another. For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future. In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy. Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b). If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure. Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized. The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 3 The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates resource relocation algorithms that are adaptive to user requests and aim to reduce communication overhead. Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources. This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c). The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier. The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another. Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated. The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5. REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete. Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both. The lack of infrastructure supports and frequent topology changes in MANETs further challenge the issue. We apply the same cross-layer paradigm to invalidating replicas in MANETs which allows concurrent updates performed by multiple replicas. To coordinate concurrent updates and disseminate replica invalidations, a special infrastructure, called validation mesh or mesh for short, is adaptively maintained among nodes possessing valid replicas of a resource. Once a node has updated its replica, an invalidation packet will only be disseminated over the validation mesh to inform other replica-possessing nodes that their replicas become invalid and should be deleted. The structure (topology) of the validation mesh keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move. To accommodate the dynamics, our scheme integrates the components of swarm intelligence to adaptively maintain the validation mesh without relying on any underlying MANET routing protocol. In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas. In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively facilitates concurrent replica updates and efficiently perform replica invalidation without incurring network-wide flooding. Figure 3 depicts the idea of validation mesh which maintains connectivity among nodes holding valid replicas of a resource to avoid network-wide flooding when invalidating replicas. Figure 3: Examples showing maintenance of validation mesh There are eight nodes in the sample network, and we start with only node A holding the valid file, as shown in Figure 3(a). Later on, node G issues a query packet for the file and eventually obtains the file from A via nodes B and D. Since intermediate nodes are allowed to cache forwarded data, nodes B, D, and G will now hold valid replicas of the file. As a result, a validation mesh is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b). In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node Bs cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the validation mesh. Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an invalidation packet over the validation mesh. Consequently, all other nodes except G remove their replicas of the file from their storage and the validation mesh is torn down. However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again. This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained. Eventually, a new validation mesh is established over nodes G, B, D, E, and H. To maintain a validation mesh among the nodes holding valid replicas, one of them is designated to be the focal node. Initially, the node that originally holds the data is the focal node. As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node. We also name nodes, such as G and H, who originate requests to replicate data as clients, and nodes B, D, and E who locally cache passing data as data nodes. For instance, in Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), node A is the focal node; in Figures 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f), node G becomes the focal node. In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the validation mesh. If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesnt hear a keep-alive packet for a certain time interval, it will deploy a search packet using the resource discovery mechanism described in Section 3 to find another node (termed attachment point) currently on the validation mesh so that it can attach itself to. Once an attachment point is found, a search_reply packet is returned to the disconnected node who originated the search. Intermediate nodes who forward the search_reply packet will become part of the validation mesh as well. To illustrate the effect of node mobility, in Figure 3(f), node H has moved to a location where it is not directly connected to the mesh. Via the resource discovery mechanism, node H relies on an intermediate node F to connect itself to the mesh. Here, node F, although part of the validation mesh, doesnt hold data replica, and hence is termed nondata node. Client and data node who keep hearing the keep-alive packets from the focal node act as if they are holding a valid replica, so that they can reply to query packets, like node B in Figure 3(c) replying a request from node H. While a disconnected node attempting to discover an attachment point to reattach itself to the mesh, the disconnected node cant reply to a query packet. For instance, in Figure 3(f), node H does not reply to any query packet before it reattaches itself to the mesh. Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move. Without relying on any MANET routing protocols, the two primitives work together to facilitate efficient search and adaptive maintenance. 6. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION We have conducted simulation experiments using the QualNet simulator to evaluate the performance of the described resource discovery, resource distribution, and replica invalidation schemes. However, due to space limitation only the performance of the replica invalidation is reported. In our experiments, eighty nodes are uniformly distributed over a terrain of size 1000×1000 m2 . Each node has a communication range of approximately 250 m over a 2 Mbps wireless channel, using IEEE802.11 as the MAC layer. We use the random-waypoint mobility model with a pause time of 1 second. Nodes may move at the minimum and maximum speeds of 1 m/s and 5 m/s, respectively. Table 1 lists other parameter settings used in the simulation. Initially, there is one resource server node in network. Two nodes are randomly picked up every 10 seconds as clients. Every β seconds, we check the number of nodes, N, which have gotten data. Then we randomly pickup Min(γ,N) nodes from them to initiate data update. Each experiment is run for 10 minutes. Table 1: Simulation Settings HOP_LIMIT 10 ADVERTISE_HOP_LIMIT 1 KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL 3 second NUM_SEARCH 1 ADVERTISE_INTERVAL 5 second EXPIRATION_INTERVAL 10 second Average Query Generation Rate 2 query/ 10 sec Max # of Concurrent Update (γ) 2 Frequency of Update (β) 3s We evaluate the performance under different mobility speed, the density, the maximum number of concurrent update nodes, and update frequency using two metrics: • Average overhead per update measures the average number of packets transmitted per update in the network. • Average delay per update measures how long our approach takes to finish an update on average. All figures shown present the results with a 70% confidence interval. Figure 4: Overhead vs. speed for 80 nodes Figure 5: Overhead vs. density Figure 6: Overhead vs. max #concurrent updates Figure 7: Overhead vs. freq. Figure 8: Delay vs. speed Figure 9: Delay vs. density The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 5 Figure 10: Delay vs. max #concurrent updates Figure 11: Delay vs. freq. Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 show the overhead versus various parameter values. In Figure 4, the overhead increases as the speed increase, which is due to the fact that as the speed increase, nodes move out of mesh more frequently, and will send out more search packets. However, the overhead is not high, and even in speed 10m/sec, the overhead is below 100 packets. In contrast, the packets will be expected to be more than 200 packets at various speeds when flooding is used. Figure 5 shows that the overhead almost remains the same under various densities. That is attributed to only flooding over the mesh instead of the whole network. The size of mesh doesnt vary much on various densities, so that the overhead doesnt vary much. Figure 6 shows that overhead also almost remains the same under various maximum number of concurrent updates. Thats because one more node just means one more flood over the mesh during update process so that the impact is limited. Figure 7 shows that if updates happen more frequently, the overhead is higher. This is because the more quickly updates happen, (1) there will be more keep_alive message over the mesh between two updates, and (2) nodes move out of mesh more frequently and send out more search packets. Figures 8, 9, 10, and 11 show the delay versus various parameter values. From Figure 8, we know the delay increases as the speed increases, which is due to the fact that with increasing speed, clients will move out of mesh with higher probability. When these clients want to update data, they will spend time to first search the mesh. The faster the speed, the more time clients need to spend to search the mesh. Figure 9 shows that delay is negligibly affected by the density. Delay decreases slightly as the number of nodes increases, due to the fact that the more nodes in the network, the more nodes receives the advertisement packets which helps the search packet find the target so that the delay of update decreases. Figure 10 shows that delay decreases slightly as the maximum number of concurrent updates increases. The larger the maximum number of concurrent updates is, the more nodes are picked up to do update. Then with higher probability, one of these nodes is still in mesh and finishes the update immediately (dont need to search mesh first), which decreases the delay. Figure 11 shows how the delay varies with the update frequency. When updates happen more frequently, the delay will higher. Because the less frequently, the more time nodes in mesh have to move out of mesh then they need to take time to search the mesh when they do update, which increases the delay. The simulation results show that the replica invalidation scheme can significantly reduce the overhead with an acceptable delay. 7. CONCLUSION To facilitate resource discovery and distribution over MANETs, one approach is to designing peer-to-peer (P2P) systems over MANETs which constructs an overlay by organizing peers of the system into a logical structure on the top of MANETs physical topology. However, deploying overlay over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth usage. Specifically, overlay routing relies on the network-layer routing protocols. In the case of a reactive routing protocol, routing on the overlay may cause a large number of flooded route discovery message since the routing path in each routing step must be discovered on demand. On the other hand, if a proactive routing protocol is adopted, each peer has to periodically broadcast control messages, which leads to poor efficiency in terms of bandwidth usage. Either way, constructing an overlay will potentially suffer from the scalability problem. The paper describes a design paradigm that uses the functional primitives of positive/negative feedback and sporadic random walk to design robust resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs. In particular, the scheme offers the features of (1) cross-layer design of P2P systems, which allows the routing process at both the P2P and the network layers to be integrated to reduce overhead, (2) scalability and mobility support, which minimizes the use of global flooding operations and adaptively combines proactive resource advertisement and reactive resource discovery, and (3) load balancing, which facilitates resource replication, relocation, and division to achieve load balancing. 8.

INTRODUCCIÓN Las redes ad-hoc móviles (MANET) consisten en nodos móviles que establecen de forma autónoma la conectividad a través de comunicaciones inalámbricas de múltiples saltos. Sin confiar en cualquier infraestructura de red existente y preconfigurada o control centralizado, las manets son útiles en situaciones en las que se requieren instalaciones de comunicación improvisadas, como las comunicaciones de campo de batalla y las misiones de alivio de desastres. A medida que las aplicaciones de Manet exigen el procesamiento colaborativo y el intercambio de información entre los nodos móviles, el descubrimiento y la distribución de recursos (servicio) se han convertido en capacidades indispensables. Un enfoque para diseñar esquemas de descubrimiento y distribución de recursos sobre Manets es construir un sistema de pares (P2P) (o una superposición) que organiza pares del sistema en una estructura lógica, además de la topología de la red real. Sin embargo, la implementación de tales sistemas P2P sobre Manets puede dar lugar a una gran cantidad de operaciones de inundación desencadenadas por el proceso de enrutamiento reactivo o la ineficiencia en términos de utilización de ancho de banda en esquemas de enrutamiento proactivo. De cualquier manera, la construcción de una superposición creará potencialmente un problema de escalabilidad para Manets a gran escala. Debido a la naturaleza dinámica de Manets, los sistemas P2P deben ser robustos al ser escalables y adaptables a los cambios de topología. Estos sistemas también deben proporcionar formas eficientes y efectivas para que los compañeros interactúen, así como otras características específicas de aplicaciones deseables. Este documento describe un paradigma de diseño que utiliza las siguientes dos primitivas funcionales para diseñar esquemas de descubrimiento y distribución de recursos robustos sobre Manets.1. Retroalimentación positiva/negativa. Los paquetes de consulta se utilizan para explorar una ruta a otros pares que tienen recursos de interés. Opcionalmente, los paquetes de publicidad se envían a las rutas publicitarias de otros pares sobre los recursos disponibles. Al atravesar una ruta, estos paquetes de control miden la bondad de la ruta y dejan información de retroalimentación en cada nodo en el camino para guiar los paquetes de control posteriores a las direcciones apropiadas.2. Caminata aleatoria esporádica. A medida que la topología de la red y/o la disponibilidad de recursos cambian, las rutas existentes pueden volverse obsoletas mientras que mejor rutas están disponibles. Sporadic Random Walk permite que un paquete de control explore diferentes caminos y descubra de manera oportunista nuevas y/o mejores rutas. Adoptando este paradigma, todo el sistema Manet P2P funciona como una colección de entidades autónomas que consisten en diferentes tipos de paquetes de control, como los paquetes de consulta y publicidad. Estos paquetes funcionan en colaboración, pero indirectamente, para lograr tareas comunes, como el descubrimiento de recursos, el enrutamiento y el equilibrio de carga. Con la colaboración entre estas entidades, un sistema MANET P2P puede aprender la dinámica de la red por sí misma y ajustar su comportamiento en consecuencia, sin la sobrecarga de organizar pares en una superposición. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. El trabajo relacionado se describe en la siguiente sección. La Sección 3 describe el esquema de descubrimiento de recursos. La Sección 4 describe el esquema de distribución de recursos. El esquema de invalidación de réplica se describe en la Sección 5, seguido de la evaluación del desempeño de TI en la Sección 6. La Sección 7 concluye el documento.2. Trabajo relacionado para Manets, los sistemas P2P se pueden clasificar en función del principio de diseño, en enfoques en capas y en capas cruzadas. Un enfoque en capas adopta una solución [1] similar a P2P, donde el descubrimiento de recursos se facilita como un protocolo de capa de aplicación y los protocolos de enrutamiento MANET subyacentes son entregados. Por ejemplo, Konark [2] hace uso de un protocolo de multidifusión subyacente de modo que los proveedores de servicios y los consultores anuncian y los servicios de búsqueda a través de un grupo de multidifusión predefinido, respectivamente. Proem [3] es una plataforma de computación móvil de alto nivel para sistemas P2P sobre Manets. Define un protocolo de transporte que se encuentra en la parte superior de la pila TCP/IP existente, por lo que depende de un protocolo de enrutamiento existente para operar. Con un control limitado sobre cómo se enrutan los paquetes de control y datos en la red, es difícil evitar la ineficiencia de los protocolos de enrutamiento de uso general que a menudo son reactivos y basados en inundaciones. En contraste, los enfoques de capas cruzadas se basan en su propio mecanismo de enrutamiento o aumenta los algoritmos de enrutamiento de Manet existentes para respaldar el descubrimiento de recursos.7ds [4], que es el trabajo pionero que implementa el sistema P2P en dispositivos móviles, explota la localidad de datos y la movilidad de los nodos a los datos de difusión de una manera de un solo salto. Por lo tanto, se puede dar como resultado una larga latencia de búsqueda, ya que un nodo 7DS puede obtener datos de interés solo si el nodo que contiene los datos está en su cobertura de radio. Mohan et al.[5] propone un algoritmo de descubrimiento de servicio adaptativo que combina modelos de empuje y tirón. Específicamente, un proveedor de servicios/Querier transmite publicidad/consulta solo cuando el número de nodos que se publicita o consulta, que se estima por los paquetes de control recibidos, está por debajo de un umbral durante un período de tiempo. De esta manera, el número de paquetes de control en la red está limitado, lo que proporciona una buena escalabilidad. A pesar del mecanismo para reducir los paquetes de control, la sobrecarga alta puede ser inevitable, especialmente cuando hay muchos clientes que intentan localizar diferentes servicios, debido al hecho de que el algoritmo se basa en las inundaciones, para la replicación de recursos, Yin y Cao [6] y diseño y y y y y y a Cao yEvaluar técnicas de almacenamiento de almacenamiento cooperativo para Manets. El almacenamiento en caché, sin embargo, se realiza reactivamente por nodos intermedios cuando un Querier solicita datos de un servidor. Los elementos o recursos de datos nunca se introducen en otros nodos de manera proactiva. Thanedar et al.[7] propone un esquema de replicación de contenido liviano utilizando una técnica de anillo de expansión. Si un servidor detecta el número de solicitudes excede un umbral dentro de un período de tiempo, comienza a replicar sus datos en nodos capaces de almacenar réplicas, cuyos recuentos de lúpulo desde el servidor son de ciertos valores. Dado que la replicación de datos se desencadena solo por la frecuencia de solicitud, es posible que haya réplicas creadas innecesariamente en un alcance grande a pesar de que solo los nodos dentro de un rango pequeño solicitan estos datos. Nuestro mecanismo de replicación de recursos propuesto, en contraste, intenta replicar un elemento de datos en las áreas apropiadas, en lugar de un área grande alrededor del servidor, donde el elemento se solicita con frecuencia.3. Descubrimiento de recursos proponemos un esquema de descubrimiento de recursos híbridos en capas híbridas que se basa en las múltiples interacciones de la consulta, la respuesta y los paquetes de publicidad. Suponemos que cada recurso está asociado con un ID1 único. Inicialmente, cuando un nodo quiere descubrir un recurso, implementa paquetes de consulta, que llevan la ID de recurso correspondiente y explora aleatoriamente la red para buscar el recurso solicitado. Al recibir dicho paquete de consulta, el nodo genera un paquete de respuesta que proporciona el recurso solicitado. Los paquetes de publicidad también se pueden usar para informar de manera proactiva a otros nodos sobre qué recursos están disponibles en cada nodo. Además de descubrir la identidad del nodo que proporciona el recurso solicitado, también puede ser necesario descubrir una ruta que conduce a este nodo para una interacción adicional. Para permitir que los nodos intermedios tomen una decisión sobre dónde reenviar los paquetes de consulta, cada nodo mantiene dos tablas: vecino 1 La suposición de ID única se hace para la brevedad en la exposición, y los recursos podrían especificarse a través de afirmaciones de valores de atributos.tabla y tabla de feromona. La tabla vecina mantiene una lista de todos los vecinos actuales obtenidos a través de un protocolo de descubrimiento de vecinos. La tabla de feromona mantiene el mapeo de una identificación de recursos y una identificación de vecinos a un valor de feromona. Esta tabla está inicialmente vacía y se actualiza por un paquete de respuesta generado por una consulta exitosa. La Figura 1 ilustra un ejemplo de una mesa vecina y una tabla de feromona mantenida por el nodo A que tiene cuatro vecinos. Cuando Node A recibe un paquete de consulta que busca un recurso, toma una decisión a qué vecino debe reenviar el paquete de consulta calculando la conveniencia de cada uno de los vecinos que el mismo paquete de consulta no ha visitado antes. Para una identificación de recursos, la conveniencia de elegir un vecino N, δ (R, N), se obtiene del valor de feromonas de la entrada cuyos campos de ID de vecinos y de recursos son N y R, respectivamente. Si no existe dicha entrada en la tabla de feromona, δ (R, N) se establece en cero. Una vez que se han calculado las deseos de todos los próximos saltos válidos, se normalizan para obtener la probabilidad de elegir a cada vecino. Además, también se asigna una pequeña probabilidad a aquellos vecinos con cero deseabilidad para ejercer la caminata aleatoria esporádica primitiva. Según estas probabilidades, se selecciona un próximo salto para reenviar el paquete de consulta. Cuando un paquete de consulta encuentra un nodo con un recurso satisfactorio, se devuelve un paquete de respuesta al nodo de consulta. El paquete de respuesta de regreso también actualiza la tabla de feromona en cada nodo en su viaje de regreso al aumentar el valor de feromona en la entrada cuyos campos de identificación de recursos y ID de vecinos coinciden con la ID del recurso descubierto y el salto anterior, respectivamente. Si tal entrada no existe, se agrega una nueva entrada a la tabla. Por lo tanto, los paquetes de consulta posteriores que buscan el mismo recurso, al encontrar esta información de feromonas, se guían hacia el mismo destino con una pequeña probabilidad de tomar una ruta alternativa. Dado que el esquema de descubrimiento híbrido no se basa en un protocolo de enrutamiento de Manet ni organiza nodos en una superposición lógica, los paquetes de consultas deben atravesar la topología de la red real. En redes densas, los grados nodales relativamente grandes pueden tener impactos potenciales en este mecanismo de exploración aleatoria. Para abordar este problema, el esquema híbrido también incorpora publicidad proactiva además de la consulta reactiva. Para realizar publicidad proactiva, cada nodo implementa periódicamente un paquete de publicidad que contiene una lista de sus ID de recursos disponibles. Estos paquetes se alejarán del nodo publicitario de manera aleatoria hasta un número limitado de lúpulo y anunciarán información de recursos a los nodos circundantes de la misma manera que los paquetes de respuesta. En el esquema híbrido, un aumento de la feromona sirve como una retroalimentación positiva que indirectamente guía paquetes de consulta que buscan recursos similares. Intuitivamente, la cantidad de feromona aumentada es inversamente proporcional a la distancia que el paquete de respuesta ha recorrido de regreso, y otras métricas, como la calidad del recurso, también podrían contribuir a esta cantidad. Cada nodo también realiza una retroalimentación negativa implícita para los recursos que no han recibido comentarios positivos durante algún tiempo al disminuir regularmente la feromona en todas sus entradas de la tabla de feromona a lo largo del tiempo. Además, la feromona puede reducirse mediante una respuesta negativa explícita, por ejemplo, un paquete de respuesta que regresa de un nodo que no está dispuesto a proporcionar un recurso debido a la carga de trabajo excesiva. Como resultado, el equilibrio de carga se puede lograr mediante retroalimentación positiva y negativa. Un nodo que sirve demasiados nodos puede devolver menos respuestas a los paquetes de consulta o generar respuestas negativas.2 La tercera conferencia internacional sobre tecnología, aplicaciones y sistemas móviles - Mobility 2006 Figura 1: Ejemplo que ilustra las tablas de vecinos y feromonas mantenidas por el nodo A: (a) conectividad inalámbrica alrededor de una muestra que actualmente tiene cuatro vecinos, (b) como vecinos de la mesa vecina, y (c) una posible tabla de feromona de una Figura 2: Escenarios de muestra que ilustran los tres mecanismos que admiten el equilibrio de carga: (a) Replicación de recursos, (b) Retocatación de recursos y (c) División de recursos 4. Distribución de recursos Además del descubrimiento de recursos, un nodo de consulta generalmente intenta acceder y recuperar el contenido de un recurso después de un descubrimiento exitoso. En ciertas situaciones, también es beneficioso hacer que un recurso esté disponible en múltiples nodos cuando el recurso puede reubicarse y/o replicarse, como los archivos de datos. Además, en Manets, debemos considerar no solo la cantidad de carga manejada por un proveedor de recursos, sino también la carga en esos nodos intermedios que se encuentran en las rutas de comunicación entre el proveedor y otros nodos también. Por lo tanto, describimos un esquema de distribución de recursos híbridos, captura cruzada para lograr el equilibrio de carga incorporando las funcionalidades de reubicación de recursos, replicación de recursos y división de recursos.4.1 Replicación de recursos múltiples réplicas de un recurso en la red ayudan a prevenir un solo nodo, así como nodos que lo rodean, por una gran cantidad de solicitudes y transferencias de datos. Un ejemplo es cuando un nodo ha obtenido un archivo de datos de otro nodo, el nodo solicitante y los nodos intermedios pueden almacenar en caché el archivo y comenzar a compartir ese archivo con otros nodos circundantes de inmediato. Además, los recursos replicables también se pueden replicar proactivamente en otros nodos que se encuentran en ciertas áreas estratégicas. Por ejemplo, para ayudar a los nodos a encontrar un recurso rápidamente, podríamos replicar el recurso para que sea accesible mediante una caminata aleatoria para un número específico de lúpulo desde cualquier nodo con cierta probabilidad, como se muestra en la Figura 2 (a). Para realizar esta característica, el esquema de distribución de recursos híbridos emplea un tipo diferente de paquete de control, llamado paquete de replicación de recursos, que es responsable de encontrar un lugar apropiado para crear una réplica de un recurso. Un paquete de replicación de recursos del Tipo R es implementado por un nodo que proporciona el recurso R en sí. A diferencia de un paquete de consulta que sigue una feromona más alta aguas arriba hacia un recurso que está buscando, un paquete de replicación de recursos tiende a ser impulsado de recursos similares al moverse aguas abajo hacia la feromona más débil. Cuando un paquete de replicación de recursos se encuentra en un área con feromona suficientemente baja, toma una decisión si debe continuar explorando o retrocediendo. La decisión depende de condiciones como la carga de trabajo actual y/o la energía restante del nodo que se está visitando, así como la popularidad del recurso en sí.4.2 Reubicación de recursos En ciertas situaciones, se puede requerir un recurso para transferir de un nodo a otro. Por ejemplo, es posible que un nodo ya no desee poseer un archivo debido a la escasez de espacio de almacenamiento, pero no puede simplemente eliminar el archivo ya que otros nodos aún pueden necesitarlo en el futuro. En este caso, el nodo puede optar por crear réplicas del archivo mediante el mecanismo de replicación de recursos antes mencionado y luego eliminar su propia copia. Consideremos una situación en la que la mayoría de los nodos que solicitan un recurso se encuentran lejos de un proveedor de recursos, como se muestra en la parte superior de la Figura 2 (b). Si el recurso R es reubicado, se prefiere reubicarse en otra área que está más cerca de esos nodos, similar a la parte inferior de la misma figura. Por lo tanto, el ancho de banda de la red se utiliza de manera más eficiente. La tercera conferencia sobre tecnología móvil, aplicaciones y sistemas - Mobility 2006 3 El esquema de distribución de recursos híbridos incorpora algoritmos de reubicación de recursos que se adaptan a las solicitudes de los usuarios y tienen como objetivo reducir la sobrecarga de comunicación. Específicamente, siguiendo el mismo concepto de mantenimiento de feromona, el esquema de distribución de recursos híbridos introduce otro tipo de feromona que corresponde a las solicitudes de los usuarios, en lugar de los recursos. Este tipo de feromona, llamada solicitud de feromona, está configurada por paquetes de consulta que están en sus fases de exploración (no devueltas) para guiar un recurso a una nueva ubicación.4.3 División de recursos Ciertos tipos de recursos se pueden dividir en subresourios más pequeños (por ejemplo, un archivo grande que se divide en archivos más pequeños) y se distribuye a múltiples ubicaciones para evitar sobrecargar un solo nodo, como se muestra en la Figura 2 (c). El esquema de distribución de recursos híbridos incorpora un mecanismo de división de recursos que opera en una capa delgada justo encima de todos los otros mecanismos descritos anteriormente. El mecanismo de la división de recursos es responsable de descomponer los recursos divisibles en subcreSources, y luego agrega una palabra clave adicional para distinguir cada subconurento entre sí. Por lo tanto, cada uno de estos subcontratos será visto por los otros mecanismos como un solo recurso que puede ser descubierto, replicado y reubicado de forma independiente. El mecanismo de la división de recursos también es responsable de combinar datos de estos subconocentes juntos (por ejemplo, fusionar piezas de un archivo) y entregar el resultado final a la aplicación.5. Réplica Invalidación Aunque las réplicas mejoran la accesibilidad y la carga de equilibrio, la invalidación de la réplica se convierte en un problema crítico cuando los nodos almacenados en caché los recursos actualizables pueden actualizar simultáneamente sus propias réplicas, que hace que las réplicas de otros nodos obsoletas. La mayoría de las soluciones existentes al problema de invalidación de la réplica imponen restricciones de que solo la fuente de datos podría realizar actualizaciones e invalidar otras réplicas, o recurrir a inundaciones en toda la red que resulta en un fuerte tráfico de red y conduce a un problema de escalabilidad, o ambas. La falta de infraestructura respalda y los cambios de topología frecuentes en Manets desafían aún más el problema. Aplicamos el mismo paradigma de capa cruzada a la invalidación de réplicas en Manets, lo que permite actualizaciones concurrentes realizadas por múltiples réplicas. Para coordinar las actualizaciones concurrentes y difundir las réplicas de invalidaciones, una infraestructura especial, llamada malla o malla de validación para abreviar, se mantiene adaptativamente entre los nodos que poseen réplicas válidas de un recurso. Una vez que un nodo ha actualizado su réplica, un paquete de invalidación solo se difundirá sobre la malla de validación para informar a otros nodos de posesión de réplicas que sus réplicas se vuelven inválidas y deben eliminarse. La estructura (topología) de la malla de validación sigue evolucionando (1) cuando los nodos solicitan y almacenan en caché un recurso, (2) cuando los nodos actualizan sus respectivas réplicas e invalidan otras réplicas, y (3) cuando los nodos se mueven. Para acomodar la dinámica, nuestro esquema integra los componentes de la inteligencia del enjambre para mantener adaptativamente la malla de validación sin confiar en cualquier protocolo de enrutamiento MANET subyacente. En particular, el esquema tiene en cuenta las actualizaciones concurrentes iniciadas por múltiples nodos para garantizar la consistencia entre las réplicas. Además, el número de versión se usa para distinguir las réplicas nuevas de las viejas al invalidar cualquier réplica obsoleta. Los resultados de la simulación muestran que el esquema propuesto facilita efectivamente las actualizaciones de réplicas concurrentes y realiza eficientemente la invalidación de réplicas sin incurrir en inundaciones en toda la red. La Figura 3 muestra la idea de la malla de validación que mantiene la conectividad entre los nodos que contienen réplicas válidas de un recurso para evitar inundaciones en toda la red al invalidar las réplicas. Figura 3: Ejemplos que muestran el mantenimiento de la malla de validación Hay ocho nodos en la red de muestra, y comenzamos solo con el nodo A que contiene el archivo válido, como se muestra en la Figura 3 (a). Más adelante, el nodo G emite un paquete de consulta para el archivo y finalmente obtiene el archivo de A Via nodos B y D. Dado que los nodos intermedios pueden almacenar en caché los datos reenviados, los nodos B, D y G ahora mantendrá réplicas válidas del archivo. Como resultado, se establece una malla de validación entre los nodos A, B, D y G, como se muestra en la Figura 3 (b). En la Figura 3 (c), otro nodo, H, ha emitido un paquete de consulta para el mismo archivo y lo obtuvo del caché BS del nodo a través del nodo E. En este punto, seis nodos contienen réplicas válidas y están conectados a través de la malla de validación. Ahora asumimos que el nodo G actualiza su réplica del archivo e informa a los otros nodos enviando un paquete de invalidación a través de la malla de validación. En consecuencia, todos los demás nodos, excepto G, eliminan sus réplicas del archivo de su almacenamiento y la malla de validación se desgarra. Sin embargo, la feromona de reenvío de la consulta, según lo denotado por las flechas punteadas en la Figura 3 (d), se configura en estos nodos a través de las rutas inversas en las que los paquetes de invalidación han recorrido, de modo que las solicitudes futuras para este archivo se reenviarán al nodo G.En la Figura 3 (e), el nodo H hace una nueva solicitud para el archivo nuevamente. Esta vez, su paquete de consulta sigue la feromona hacia el nodo G, donde se puede obtener el archivo actualizado. Finalmente, se establece una nueva malla de validación sobre los nodos G, B, D, E y H. Para mantener una malla de validación entre los nodos que contienen réplicas válidas, una de ellas está designada como el nodo focal. Inicialmente, el nodo que posee originalmente los datos es el nodo focal. A medida que los nodos actualizan las réplicas, el nodo que dura (o más recientemente) actualiza una 4ª Conferencia Internacional sobre Tecnología Móvil, Aplicaciones y Sistemas - Mobility 2006 La réplica correspondiente asume el papel del nodo focal. También nombramos nodos, como G y H, que originan las solicitudes para replicar datos como clientes y nodos B, D y E que almacenan en caché localmente los datos como nodos de datos. Por ejemplo, en las Figuras 3 (a), 3 (b) y 3 (c), el nodo A es el nodo focal;En las Figuras 3 (d), 3 (e) y 3 (f), el nodo G se convierte en el nodo focal. Además, para acomodar nodos recién participantes y la movilidad de los nodos, el nodo focal inunda periódicamente la malla de validación con un paquete de mantenimiento de alas, para que los nodos que puedan escuchar este paquete se consideran parte de la malla de validación. Si un nodo que contiene una réplica válida/actualizada no escucha un paquete de Alive-Alive para un cierto intervalo de tiempo, implementará un paquete de búsqueda utilizando el mecanismo de descubrimiento de recursos descrito en la Sección 3 para encontrar otro nodo (punto de archivo adjunto) actualmente en la validaciónmalla para que pueda adjuntar. Una vez que se encuentra un punto de archivo adjunto, se devuelve un paquete de búsqueda_reply al nodo desconectado que originó la búsqueda. Los nodos intermedios que reenvían el paquete Search_reply también se convertirán en parte de la malla de validación. Para ilustrar el efecto de la movilidad del nodo, en la Figura 3 (f), el nodo H se ha movido a una ubicación donde no está conectado directamente a la malla. A través del mecanismo de descubrimiento de recursos, el nodo H se basa en un nodo intermedio F para conectarse a la malla. Aquí, el nodo F, aunque parte de la malla de validación, no contiene la réplica de datos y, por lo tanto, se denomina nodo no data. El cliente y el nodo de datos que siguen escuchando los paquetes Keep-Alive desde el nodo focal actúan como si estuvieran conteniendo una réplica válida, para que puedan responder a los paquetes de consulta, como el nodo B en la Figura 3 (c) respondiendo una solicitud desde el nodo H. Mientras un nodo desconectado que intenta descubrir un punto de fijación para volver a colocar a la malla, el nodo desconectado no puede responder a un paquete de consulta. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 3 (f), el nodo H no responde a ningún paquete de consulta antes de volver a colocar a la malla. Aunque la malla de validación proporciona una topología conceptual que (1) conecta todas las réplicas juntas, (2) coordina las actualizaciones concurrentes y (3) difunde los paquetes de invalidación, el problema técnico es cómo tal topología de malla podría mantenerse y evolucionar de manera efectiva y eficiente cuando ((a) Los nodos solicitan y almacenan en caché un recurso, (b) cuando los nodos actualizan sus respectivas réplicas e invalidan otras réplicas, y (c) cuando los nodos se mueven. Sin confiar en ningún protocolo de enrutamiento de Manet, las dos primitivas trabajan juntas para facilitar la búsqueda eficiente y el mantenimiento adaptativo.6. Evaluación del desempeño Hemos realizado experimentos de simulación utilizando el simulador Qualnet para evaluar el rendimiento del descubrimiento de recursos descrito, la distribución de recursos y los esquemas de invalidación de réplicas. Sin embargo, debido a la limitación del espacio, solo se informa el rendimiento de la réplica de invalidación. En nuestros experimentos, ochenta nodos se distribuyen uniformemente sobre un terreno de tamaño 1000 × 1000 m2. Cada nodo tiene un rango de comunicación de aproximadamente 250 m sobre un canal inalámbrico de 2 Mbps, utilizando IEEE802.11 como la capa MAC. Utilizamos el modelo de movilidad de punto aleatorio con un tiempo de pausa de 1 segundo. Los nodos pueden moverse a velocidades mínimas y máximas de 1 m/sy 5 m/s, respectivamente. La Tabla 1 enumera otras configuraciones de parámetros utilizadas en la simulación. Inicialmente, hay un nodo de servidor de recursos en la red. Dos nodos se recogen al azar cada 10 segundos como clientes. Cada β segundos, verificamos el número de nodos, n, que han recibido datos. Luego retomamos al azar los nodos MIN (γ, N) de ellos para iniciar la actualización de datos. Cada experimento se ejecuta durante 10 minutos.

Todas las cifras que se muestran presentan los resultados con un intervalo de confianza del 70%. Figura 4: Overhead vs. Velocidad para 80 nodos Figura 5: Overhead versus densidad Figura 6: Overhead vs. Max #Actualizaciones de concurrencia Figura 7: Overhead vs. Freq. Figura 8: Retraso versus velocidad Figura 9: Retraso versus densidad La tercera conferencia sobre tecnología móvil, aplicaciones y sistemas - Movilidad 2006 5 Figura 10: Retraso vs. Actualizaciones máximas #Concurrentes Figura 11: Retraso frente a la frecuencia. Las Figuras 4, 5, 6 y 7 muestran la sobrecarga versus varios valores de parámetros. En la Figura 4, la sobrecarga aumenta a medida que aumenta la velocidad, lo que se debe al hecho de que a medida que aumenta la velocidad, los nodos salen de la malla con más frecuencia y enviarán más paquetes de búsqueda. Sin embargo, la sobrecarga no es alta, e incluso en la velocidad de 10 m/seg, la sobrecarga es inferior a 100 paquetes. En contraste, se espera que los paquetes sean más de 200 paquetes a varias velocidades cuando se usan inundaciones. La Figura 5 muestra que la sobrecarga casi sigue siendo la misma bajo varias densidades. Eso se atribuye solo a las inundaciones sobre la malla en lugar de toda la red. El tamaño de la malla no varía mucho en varias densidades, por lo que la sobrecarga no varía mucho. La Figura 6 muestra que la sobrecarga también casi sigue siendo la misma bajo varios números máximos de actualizaciones concurrentes. Eso es porque un nodo más solo significa una inundación más sobre la malla durante el proceso de actualización para que el impacto sea limitado. La Figura 7 muestra que si las actualizaciones ocurren con más frecuencia, la sobrecarga es más alta. Esto se debe a que las actualizaciones más rápidas ocurren, (1) habrá más mensaje de Keep_alive sobre la malla entre dos actualizaciones, y (2) los nodos salen de la malla con más frecuencia y enviarán más paquetes de búsqueda. Las Figuras 8, 9, 10 y 11 muestran el retraso versus varios valores de parámetros. De la Figura 8, sabemos que el retraso aumenta a medida que aumenta la velocidad, lo que se debe al hecho de que al aumentar la velocidad, los clientes saldrán fuera de la malla con mayor probabilidad. Cuando estos clientes quieran actualizar los datos, pasarán tiempo para buscar primero la malla. Cuanto más rápida sea la velocidad, más tiempo necesitan pasar los clientes para buscar en la malla. La Figura 9 muestra que el retraso se ve negativamente afectado por la densidad. El retraso disminuye ligeramente a medida que aumenta el número de nodos, debido al hecho de que cuantos más nodos en la red, más nodos reciben los paquetes de publicidad que ayuda al paquete de búsqueda a encontrar el objetivo para que disminuya el retraso de la actualización. La Figura 10 muestra que el retraso disminuye ligeramente a medida que aumenta el número máximo de actualizaciones concurrentes. Cuanto mayor sea el número máximo de actualizaciones concurrentes, más nodos se recogen para hacer la actualización. Luego, con mayor probabilidad, uno de estos nodos todavía está en malla y termina la actualización de inmediato (no es necesario buscar malla primero), lo que disminuye el retraso. La Figura 11 muestra cómo el retraso varía con la frecuencia de actualización. Cuando las actualizaciones ocurren con más frecuencia, el retraso será mayor. Debido a que cuanto menos frecuentemente, más nodos de tiempo en malla tienen que salir de la malla, entonces deben tomarse el tiempo para buscar en la malla cuando se actualizan, lo que aumenta el retraso. Los resultados de la simulación muestran que el esquema de invalidación de réplica puede reducir significativamente la sobrecarga con un retraso aceptable.7. Conclusión Para facilitar el descubrimiento y distribución de recursos sobre Manets, un enfoque es diseñar sistemas de pares (P2P) sobre Manets que construye una superposición organizando a los compañeros del sistema en una estructura lógica en la parte superior de la topología física de Manets. Sin embargo, la implementación de superposición sobre Manets puede dar lugar a una gran cantidad de operaciones de inundación desencadenadas por el proceso de enrutamiento o la ineficiencia en términos de uso de ancho de banda. Específicamente, el enrutamiento superpuesto se basa en los protocolos de enrutamiento de la capa de red. En el caso de un protocolo de enrutamiento reactivo, el enrutamiento en la superposición puede causar una gran cantidad de mensaje de descubrimiento de ruta inundado ya que la ruta de enrutamiento en cada paso de enrutamiento debe descubrirse a pedido. Por otro lado, si se adopta un protocolo de enrutamiento proactivo, cada par debe transmitir periódicamente los mensajes de control, lo que conduce a una mala eficiencia en términos de uso de ancho de banda. De cualquier manera, la construcción de una superposición potencialmente sufrirá el problema de escalabilidad. El documento describe un paradigma de diseño que utiliza las primitivas funcionales de la retroalimentación positiva/negativa y la caminata aleatoria esporádica para diseñar esquemas robustos de descubrimiento y distribución de recursos sobre Manets. En particular, el esquema ofrece las características del diseño de capas cruzadas de sistemas P2P, lo que permite que el proceso de enrutamiento tanto en el P2P como en las capas de red se integren para reducir la sobrecarga, (2) la escalabilidad y el soporte de movilidad, que minimizaEl uso de operaciones globales de inundación y combina adaptativamente la publicidad de recursos proactivos y el descubrimiento de recursos reactivos, y (3) equilibrio de carga, que facilita la replicación de recursos, la reubicación y la división para lograr el equilibrio de carga.8.

        "RESOURCE DISCOVERY We propose a cross-layer, hybrid resource discovery scheme that relies on the multiple interactions of query, reply and advertisement packets.",
        "We assume that each resource is associated with a unique ID1 .",
        "Initially, when a node wants to discover a resource, it deploys query packets, which carry the corresponding resource ID, and randomly explore the network to search for the requested resource.",
        "Upon receiving such a query packet, a reply packet is generated by the node providing the requested resource.",
        "Advertisement packets can also be used to proactively inform other nodes about what resources are available at each node.",
        "In addition to discovering the identity of the node providing the requested resource, it may be also necessary to discover a route leading to this node for further interaction.",
        "To allow intermediate nodes to make a decision on where to forward query packets, each node maintains two tables: neighbor 1 The assumption of unique ID is made for brevity in exposition, and resources could be specified via attribute-value assertions. table and pheromone table.",
        "The neighbor table maintains a list of all current neighbors obtained via a neighbor discovery protocol.",
        "The pheromone table maintains the mapping of a resource ID and a neighbor ID to a pheromone value.",
        "This table is initially empty, and is updated by a reply packet generated by a successful query.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates an example of a neighbor table and a pheromone table maintained by node A having four neighbors.",
        "When node A receives a query packet searching for a resource, it makes a decision to which neighbor it should forward the query packet by computing the desirability of each of the neighbors that have not been visited before by the same query packet.",
        "For a resource ID r, the desirability of choosing a neighbor n, δ(r,n), is obtained from the pheromone value of the entry whose neighbor and resource ID fields are n and r, respectively.",
        "If no such entry exists in the pheromone table, δ(r,n) is set to zero.",
        "Once the desirabilities of all valid next hops have been calculated, they are normalized to obtain the probability of choosing each neighbor.",
        "In addition, a small probability is also assigned to those neighbors with zero desirability to exercise the sporadic random walk primitive.",
        "Based on these probabilities, a next hop is selected to forward the query packet to.",
        "When a query packet encounters a node with a satisfying resource, a reply packet is returned to the querying node.",
        "The returning reply packet also updates the pheromone table at each node on its return trip by increasing the pheromone value in the entry whose resource ID and neighbor ID fields match the ID of the discovered resource and the previous hop, respectively.",
        "If such an entry does not exist, a new entry is added into the table.",
        "Therefore, subsequent query packets looking for the same resource, when encountering this pheromone information, are then guided toward the same destination with a small probability of taking an alternate path.",
        "Since the hybrid discovery scheme neither relies on a MANET routing protocol nor arranges nodes into a logical overlay, query packets are to traverse the actual network topology.",
        "In dense networks, relatively large nodal degrees can have potential impacts on this random exploring mechanism.",
        "To address this issue, the hybrid scheme also incorporates proactive advertisement in addition to the reactive query.",
        "To perform proactive advertisement, each node periodically deploys an advertising packet containing a list of its available resources IDs.",
        "These packets will traverse away from the advertising node in a random walk manner up to a limited number of hops and advertise resource information to surrounding nodes in the same way as reply packets.",
        "In the hybrid scheme, an increase of pheromone serves as a positive feedback which indirectly guides query packets looking for similar resources.",
        "Intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well.",
        "Each node also performs an implicit negative feedback for resources that have not been given a positive feedback for some time by regularly decreasing the pheromone in all of its pheromone table entries over time.",
        "In addition, pheromone can be reduced by an explicit negative response, for instance, a reply packet returning from a node that is not willing to provide a resource due to excessive workload.",
        "As a result, load balancing can be achieved via positive and negative feedback.",
        "A node serving too many nodes can either return fewer responses to query packets or generate negative responses. 2 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 Figure 1: Example illustrating neighbor and pheromone tables maintained by node A: (a) wireless connectivity around A showing that it currently has four neighbors, (b) As neighbor table, and (c) a possible pheromone table of A Figure 2: Sample scenarios illustrating the three mechanisms supporting load-balancing: (a) resource replication, (b) resource relocation, and (c) resource division 4.",
        "RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION In addition to resource discovery, a querying node usually attempts to access and retrieve the contents of a resource after a successful discovery.",
        "In certain situations, it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the resource can be relocated and/or replicated, such as data files.",
        "Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well.",
        "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
        "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
        "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
        "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
        "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
        "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
        "Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
        "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
        "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
        "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
        "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
        "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",
        "If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure.",
        "Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized.",
        "The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 3 The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates resource relocation algorithms that are adaptive to user requests and aim to reduce communication overhead.",
        "Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources.",
        "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
        "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
        "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",
        "Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated.",
        "The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5.",
        "REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete.",
        "Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both.",
        "The lack of infrastructure supports and frequent topology changes in MANETs further challenge the issue.",
        "We apply the same cross-layer paradigm to invalidating replicas in MANETs which allows concurrent updates performed by multiple replicas.",
        "To coordinate concurrent updates and disseminate replica invalidations, a special infrastructure, called validation mesh or mesh for short, is adaptively maintained among nodes possessing valid replicas of a resource.",
        "Once a node has updated its replica, an invalidation packet will only be disseminated over the validation mesh to inform other replica-possessing nodes that their replicas become invalid and should be deleted.",
        "The structure (topology) of the validation mesh keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move.",
        "To accommodate the dynamics, our scheme integrates the components of swarm intelligence to adaptively maintain the validation mesh without relying on any underlying MANET routing protocol.",
        "In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas.",
        "In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica.",
        "Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively facilitates concurrent replica updates and efficiently perform replica invalidation without incurring network-wide flooding.",
        "Figure 3 depicts the idea of validation mesh which maintains connectivity among nodes holding valid replicas of a resource to avoid network-wide flooding when invalidating replicas.",
        "Figure 3: Examples showing maintenance of validation mesh There are eight nodes in the sample network, and we start with only node A holding the valid file, as shown in Figure 3(a).",
        "Later on, node G issues a query packet for the file and eventually obtains the file from A via nodes B and D. Since intermediate nodes are allowed to cache forwarded data, nodes B, D, and G will now hold valid replicas of the file.",
        "As a result, a validation mesh is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b).",
        "In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node Bs cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the validation mesh.",
        "Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an invalidation packet over the validation mesh.",
        "Consequently, all other nodes except G remove their replicas of the file from their storage and the validation mesh is torn down.",
        "However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
        "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",
        "Eventually, a new validation mesh is established over nodes G, B, D, E, and H. To maintain a validation mesh among the nodes holding valid replicas, one of them is designated to be the focal node.",
        "Initially, the node that originally holds the data is the focal node.",
        "As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node.",
        "We also name nodes, such as G and H, who originate requests to replicate data as clients, and nodes B, D, and E who locally cache passing data as data nodes.",
        "For instance, in Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), node A is the focal node; in Figures 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f), node G becomes the focal node.",
        "In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the validation mesh.",
        "If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesnt hear a keep-alive packet for a certain time interval, it will deploy a search packet using the resource discovery mechanism described in Section 3 to find another node (termed attachment point) currently on the validation mesh so that it can attach itself to.",
        "Once an attachment point is found, a search_reply packet is returned to the disconnected node who originated the search.",
        "Intermediate nodes who forward the search_reply packet will become part of the validation mesh as well.",
        "To illustrate the effect of node mobility, in Figure 3(f), node H has moved to a location where it is not directly connected to the mesh.",
        "Via the resource discovery mechanism, node H relies on an intermediate node F to connect itself to the mesh.",
        "Here, node F, although part of the validation mesh, doesnt hold data replica, and hence is termed nondata node.",
        "Client and data node who keep hearing the keep-alive packets from the focal node act as if they are holding a valid replica, so that they can reply to query packets, like node B in Figure 3(c) replying a request from node H. While a disconnected node attempting to discover an attachment point to reattach itself to the mesh, the disconnected node cant reply to a query packet.",
        "For instance, in Figure 3(f), node H does not reply to any query packet before it reattaches itself to the mesh.",
        "Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.",
        "Without relying on any MANET routing protocols, the two primitives work together to facilitate efficient search and adaptive maintenance. 6.",
        "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION We have conducted simulation experiments using the QualNet simulator to evaluate the performance of the described resource discovery, resource distribution, and replica invalidation schemes.",

        "Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 show the overhead versus various parameter values.",
        "In Figure 4, the overhead increases as the speed increase, which is due to the fact that as the speed increase, nodes move out of mesh more frequently, and will send out more search packets.",
        "However, the overhead is not high, and even in speed 10m/sec, the overhead is below 100 packets.",
        "In contrast, the packets will be expected to be more than 200 packets at various speeds when flooding is used.",
        "Figure 5 shows that the overhead almost remains the same under various densities.",
        "That is attributed to only flooding over the mesh instead of the whole network.",
        "The size of mesh doesnt vary much on various densities, so that the overhead doesnt vary much.",
        "Figure 6 shows that overhead also almost remains the same under various maximum number of concurrent updates.",
        "Thats because one more node just means one more flood over the mesh during update process so that the impact is limited.",
        "Figure 7 shows that if updates happen more frequently, the overhead is higher.",
        "This is because the more quickly updates happen, (1) there will be more keep_alive message over the mesh between two updates, and (2) nodes move out of mesh more frequently and send out more search packets.",
        "Figures 8, 9, 10, and 11 show the delay versus various parameter values.",
        "From Figure 8, we know the delay increases as the speed increases, which is due to the fact that with increasing speed, clients will move out of mesh with higher probability.",
        "When these clients want to update data, they will spend time to first search the mesh.",
        "The faster the speed, the more time clients need to spend to search the mesh.",
        "Figure 9 shows that delay is negligibly affected by the density.",
        "Delay decreases slightly as the number of nodes increases, due to the fact that the more nodes in the network, the more nodes receives the advertisement packets which helps the search packet find the target so that the delay of update decreases.",
        "Figure 10 shows that delay decreases slightly as the maximum number of concurrent updates increases.",
        "The larger the maximum number of concurrent updates is, the more nodes are picked up to do update.",
        "Then with higher probability, one of these nodes is still in mesh and finishes the update immediately (dont need to search mesh first), which decreases the delay.",
        "Figure 11 shows how the delay varies with the update frequency.",
        "When updates happen more frequently, the delay will higher.",
        "Because the less frequently, the more time nodes in mesh have to move out of mesh then they need to take time to search the mesh when they do update, which increases the delay.",

        "CONCLUSION To facilitate resource discovery and distribution over MANETs, one approach is to designing peer-to-peer (P2P) systems over MANETs which constructs an overlay by organizing peers of the system into a logical structure on the top of MANETs physical topology.",

        "Specifically, overlay routing relies on the network-layer routing protocols.",
        "In the case of a reactive routing protocol, routing on the overlay may cause a large number of flooded route discovery message since the routing path in each routing step must be discovered on demand.",
        "On the other hand, if a proactive routing protocol is adopted, each peer has to periodically broadcast control messages, which leads to poor efficiency in terms of bandwidth usage.",

                "Initially, when a node wants to discover a resource, it deploys query packets, which carry the corresponding resource ID, and randomly explore the network to search for the requested resource.",
                "Upon receiving such a query packet, a reply packet is generated by the node providing the requested resource.",

                "Once the desirabilities of all valid next hops have been calculated, they are normalized to obtain the probability of choosing each neighbor.",

                "When a query packet encounters a node with a satisfying resource, a reply packet is returned to the querying node.",
                "The returning reply packet also updates the pheromone table at each node on its return trip by increasing the pheromone value in the entry whose resource ID and neighbor ID fields match the ID of the discovered resource and the previous hop, respectively.",
                "If such an entry does not exist, a new entry is added into the table.",
                "Therefore, subsequent query packets looking for the same resource, when encountering this pheromone information, are then guided toward the same destination with a small probability of taking an alternate path.",
                "Since the hybrid discovery scheme neither relies on a <br>manet</br> routing protocol nor arranges nodes into a logical overlay, query packets are to traverse the actual network topology.",
                "In dense networks, relatively large nodal degrees can have potential impacts on this random exploring mechanism.",
                "To address this issue, the hybrid scheme also incorporates proactive advertisement in addition to the reactive query.",
                "To perform proactive advertisement, each node periodically deploys an advertising packet containing a list of its available resources IDs.",
                "These packets will traverse away from the advertising node in a random walk manner up to a limited number of hops and advertise resource information to surrounding nodes in the same way as reply packets.",
                "In the hybrid scheme, an increase of pheromone serves as a positive feedback which indirectly guides query packets looking for similar resources.",
                "Intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well.",
                "Each node also performs an implicit negative feedback for resources that have not been given a positive feedback for some time by regularly decreasing the pheromone in all of its pheromone table entries over time.",
                "In addition, pheromone can be reduced by an explicit negative response, for instance, a reply packet returning from a node that is not willing to provide a resource due to excessive workload.",

                "RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION In addition to resource discovery, a querying node usually attempts to access and retrieve the contents of a resource after a successful discovery.",
                "In certain situations, it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the resource can be relocated and/or replicated, such as data files.",
                "Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well.",
                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
                "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
                "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
                "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
                "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
                "Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
                "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
                "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",
                "If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure.",
                "Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized.",

                "Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources.",
                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
                "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",
                "Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated.",
                "The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5.",
                "REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete.",
                "Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both.",

                "To coordinate concurrent updates and disseminate replica invalidations, a special infrastructure, called validation mesh or mesh for short, is adaptively maintained among nodes possessing valid replicas of a resource.",
                "Once a node has updated its replica, an invalidation packet will only be disseminated over the validation mesh to inform other replica-possessing nodes that their replicas become invalid and should be deleted.",
                "The structure (topology) of the validation mesh keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move.",
                "To accommodate the dynamics, our scheme integrates the components of swarm intelligence to adaptively maintain the validation mesh without relying on any underlying <br>manet</br> routing protocol.",
                "In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas.",
                "In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica.",

                "Later on, node G issues a query packet for the file and eventually obtains the file from A via nodes B and D. Since intermediate nodes are allowed to cache forwarded data, nodes B, D, and G will now hold valid replicas of the file.",
                "As a result, a validation mesh is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b).",
                "In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node Bs cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the validation mesh.",
                "Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an invalidation packet over the validation mesh.",
                "Consequently, all other nodes except G remove their replicas of the file from their storage and the validation mesh is torn down.",
                "However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
                "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",
                "Eventually, a new validation mesh is established over nodes G, B, D, E, and H. To maintain a validation mesh among the nodes holding valid replicas, one of them is designated to be the focal node.",
                "Initially, the node that originally holds the data is the focal node.",
                "As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node.",
                "We also name nodes, such as G and H, who originate requests to replicate data as clients, and nodes B, D, and E who locally cache passing data as data nodes.",
                "For instance, in Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), node A is the focal node; in Figures 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f), node G becomes the focal node.",
                "In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the validation mesh.",
                "If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesnt hear a keep-alive packet for a certain time interval, it will deploy a search packet using the resource discovery mechanism described in Section 3 to find another node (termed attachment point) currently on the validation mesh so that it can attach itself to.",
                "Once an attachment point is found, a search_reply packet is returned to the disconnected node who originated the search.",
                "Intermediate nodes who forward the search_reply packet will become part of the validation mesh as well.",
                "To illustrate the effect of node mobility, in Figure 3(f), node H has moved to a location where it is not directly connected to the mesh.",
                "Via the resource discovery mechanism, node H relies on an intermediate node F to connect itself to the mesh.",
                "Here, node F, although part of the validation mesh, doesnt hold data replica, and hence is termed nondata node.",
                "Client and data node who keep hearing the keep-alive packets from the focal node act as if they are holding a valid replica, so that they can reply to query packets, like node B in Figure 3(c) replying a request from node H. While a disconnected node attempting to discover an attachment point to reattach itself to the mesh, the disconnected node cant reply to a query packet.",
                "For instance, in Figure 3(f), node H does not reply to any query packet before it reattaches itself to the mesh.",
                "Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.",

                "Specifically, overlay routing relies on the network-layer routing protocols.",
                "In the case of a reactive routing protocol, routing on the overlay may cause a large number of flooded route discovery message since the routing path in each routing step must be discovered on demand.",
                "On the other hand, if a proactive routing protocol is adopted, each peer has to periodically broadcast control messages, which leads to poor efficiency in terms of bandwidth usage.",
                "Either way, constructing an overlay will potentially suffer from the scalability problem.",
                "The paper describes a design paradigm that uses the functional primitives of positive/negative feedback and sporadic random walk to design robust resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs.",
                "In particular, the scheme offers the features of (1) cross-layer design of P2P systems, which allows the routing process at both the P2P and the network layers to be integrated to reduce overhead, (2) scalability and mobility support, which minimizes the use of global flooding operations and adaptively combines proactive resource advertisement and reactive resource discovery, and (3) load balancing, which facilitates resource replication, relocation, and division to achieve load balancing. 8.",

                "Once the desirabilities of all valid next hops have been calculated, they are normalized to obtain the probability of choosing each neighbor.",

                "If such an entry does not exist, a new entry is added into the table.",
                "Therefore, subsequent query packets looking for the same resource, when encountering this pheromone information, are then guided toward the same destination with a small probability of taking an alternate path.",
                "Since the hybrid discovery scheme neither relies on a MANET routing protocol nor arranges nodes into a logical overlay, query packets are to traverse the actual network topology.",
                "In dense networks, relatively large nodal degrees can have potential impacts on this random exploring mechanism.",
                "To address this issue, the hybrid scheme also incorporates proactive advertisement in addition to the reactive query.",
                "To perform proactive advertisement, each node periodically deploys an advertising packet containing a list of its available resources IDs.",
                "These packets will traverse away from the advertising node in a random walk manner up to a limited number of hops and advertise resource information to surrounding nodes in the same way as reply packets.",
                "In the hybrid scheme, an increase of pheromone serves as a positive feedback which indirectly guides query packets looking for similar resources.",
                "Intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well.",
                "Each node also performs an implicit negative feedback for resources that have not been given a positive feedback for some time by regularly decreasing the pheromone in all of its pheromone table entries over time.",
                "In addition, pheromone can be reduced by an explicit negative response, for instance, a reply packet returning from a node that is not willing to provide a resource due to excessive workload.",

                "RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION In addition to resource discovery, a querying node usually attempts to access and retrieve the contents of a resource after a successful discovery.",
                "In certain situations, it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the resource can be relocated and/or replicated, such as data files.",
                "Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well.",
                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
                "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
                "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
                "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
                "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
                "Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
                "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
                "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",
                "If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure.",
                "Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized.",
                "The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 3 The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates resource relocation algorithms that are adaptive to user requests and aim to reduce communication overhead.",
                "Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources.",
                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
                "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",
                "Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated.",
                "The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5.",
                "REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete.",
                "Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both.",
                "The lack of infrastructure supports and frequent topology changes in MANETs further challenge the issue.",
                "We apply the same cross-layer paradigm to invalidating replicas in MANETs which allows concurrent updates performed by multiple replicas.",
                "To coordinate concurrent updates and disseminate replica invalidations, a special infrastructure, called validation mesh or mesh for short, is adaptively maintained among nodes possessing valid replicas of a resource.",
                "Once a node has updated its replica, an invalidation packet will only be disseminated over the validation mesh to inform other replica-possessing nodes that their replicas become invalid and should be deleted.",
                "The structure (topology) of the validation mesh keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move.",
                "To accommodate the dynamics, our scheme integrates the components of swarm intelligence to adaptively maintain the validation mesh without relying on any underlying MANET routing protocol.",
                "In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas.",
                "In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica.",
                "Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively facilitates concurrent replica updates and efficiently perform replica invalidation without incurring network-wide flooding.",
                "Figure 3 depicts the idea of validation mesh which maintains connectivity among nodes holding valid replicas of a resource to avoid network-wide flooding when invalidating replicas.",
                "Figure 3: Examples showing maintenance of validation mesh There are eight nodes in the sample network, and we start with only node A holding the valid file, as shown in Figure 3(a).",
                "Later on, node G issues a query packet for the file and eventually obtains the file from A via nodes B and D. Since intermediate nodes are allowed to cache forwarded data, nodes B, D, and G will now hold valid replicas of the file.",
                "As a result, a validation mesh is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b).",
                "In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node Bs cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the validation mesh.",
                "Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an invalidation packet over the validation mesh.",
                "Consequently, all other nodes except G remove their replicas of the file from their storage and the validation mesh is torn down.",

                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
                "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
                "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
                "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
                "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
                "Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
                "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
                "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",
                "If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure.",
                "Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized.",
                "The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 3 The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates resource relocation algorithms that are adaptive to user requests and aim to reduce communication overhead.",
                "Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources.",
                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
                "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",
                "Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated.",
                "The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5.",
                "REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete.",
                "Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both.",
                "The lack of infrastructure supports and frequent topology changes in MANETs further challenge the issue.",
                "We apply the same cross-layer paradigm to invalidating replicas in MANETs which allows concurrent updates performed by multiple replicas.",
                "To coordinate concurrent updates and disseminate replica invalidations, a special infrastructure, called validation mesh or mesh for short, is adaptively maintained among nodes possessing valid replicas of a resource.",
                "Once a node has updated its replica, an invalidation packet will only be disseminated over the validation mesh to inform other replica-possessing nodes that their replicas become invalid and should be deleted.",
                "The structure (topology) of the validation mesh keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move.",
                "To accommodate the dynamics, our scheme integrates the components of swarm intelligence to adaptively maintain the validation mesh without relying on any underlying MANET routing protocol.",
                "In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas.",
                "In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica.",
                "Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively facilitates concurrent replica updates and efficiently perform replica invalidation without incurring network-wide flooding.",
                "Figure 3 depicts the idea of validation mesh which maintains connectivity among nodes holding valid replicas of a resource to avoid network-wide flooding when invalidating replicas.",
                "Figure 3: Examples showing maintenance of validation mesh There are eight nodes in the sample network, and we start with only node A holding the valid file, as shown in Figure 3(a).",
                "Later on, node G issues a query packet for the file and eventually obtains the file from A via nodes B and D. Since intermediate nodes are allowed to cache forwarded data, nodes B, D, and G will now hold valid replicas of the file.",
                "As a result, a validation mesh is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b).",
                "In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node Bs cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the validation mesh.",
                "Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an invalidation packet over the validation mesh.",
                "Consequently, all other nodes except G remove their replicas of the file from their storage and the validation mesh is torn down.",
                "However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
                "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",
                "Eventually, a new validation mesh is established over nodes G, B, D, E, and H. To maintain a validation mesh among the nodes holding valid replicas, one of them is designated to be the focal node.",
                "Initially, the node that originally holds the data is the focal node.",
                "As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node.",
                "We also name nodes, such as G and H, who originate requests to replicate data as clients, and nodes B, D, and E who locally cache passing data as data nodes.",
                "For instance, in Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), node A is the focal node; in Figures 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f), node G becomes the focal node.",
                "In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the validation mesh.",
                "If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesnt hear a keep-alive packet for a certain time interval, it will deploy a search packet using the resource discovery mechanism described in Section 3 to find another node (termed attachment point) currently on the validation mesh so that it can attach itself to.",
                "Once an attachment point is found, a search_reply packet is returned to the disconnected node who originated the search.",
                "Intermediate nodes who forward the search_reply packet will become part of the validation mesh as well.",
                "To illustrate the effect of node mobility, in Figure 3(f), node H has moved to a location where it is not directly connected to the mesh.",
                "Via the resource discovery mechanism, node H relies on an intermediate node F to connect itself to the mesh.",
                "Here, node F, although part of the validation mesh, doesnt hold data replica, and hence is termed nondata node.",
                "Client and data node who keep hearing the keep-alive packets from the focal node act as if they are holding a valid replica, so that they can reply to query packets, like node B in Figure 3(c) replying a request from node H. While a disconnected node attempting to discover an attachment point to reattach itself to the mesh, the disconnected node cant reply to a query packet.",
                "For instance, in Figure 3(f), node H does not reply to any query packet before it reattaches itself to the mesh.",
                "Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.",
                "Without relying on any MANET routing protocols, the two primitives work together to facilitate efficient search and adaptive maintenance. 6.",

                "When updates happen more frequently, the delay will higher.",

                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",

                "However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
                "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",

                "In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the validation mesh.",

                "One approach to designing resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs is to construct a peer-to-peer (P2P) system (or an overlay) which organizes peers of the system into a logical structure, on top of the actual network topology.",
                "However, deploying such P2P systems over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the reactive routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth utilization in proactive routing schemes.",

                "Initially, when a node wants to discover a resource, it deploys query packets, which carry the corresponding resource ID, and randomly explore the network to search for the requested resource.",
                "Upon receiving such a query packet, a reply packet is generated by the node providing the requested resource.",
                "Advertisement packets can also be used to proactively inform other nodes about what resources are available at each node.",
                "In addition to discovering the identity of the node providing the requested resource, it may be also necessary to discover a route leading to this node for further interaction.",
                "To allow intermediate nodes to make a decision on where to forward query packets, each node maintains two tables: neighbor 1 The assumption of unique ID is made for brevity in exposition, and resources could be specified via attribute-value assertions. table and pheromone table.",
                "The neighbor table maintains a list of all current neighbors obtained via a neighbor discovery protocol.",
                "The pheromone table maintains the mapping of a resource ID and a neighbor ID to a pheromone value.",
                "This table is initially empty, and is updated by a reply packet generated by a successful query.",

                "When node A receives a query packet searching for a resource, it makes a decision to which neighbor it should forward the query packet by computing the desirability of each of the neighbors that have not been visited before by the same query packet.",
                "For a resource ID r, the desirability of choosing a neighbor n, δ(r,n), is obtained from the pheromone value of the entry whose neighbor and resource ID fields are n and r, respectively.",
                "If no such entry exists in the pheromone table, δ(r,n) is set to zero.",
                "Once the desirabilities of all valid next hops have been calculated, they are normalized to obtain the probability of choosing each neighbor.",
                "In addition, a small probability is also assigned to those neighbors with zero desirability to exercise the sporadic random walk primitive.",
                "Based on these probabilities, a next hop is selected to forward the query packet to.",
                "When a query packet encounters a node with a satisfying resource, a reply packet is returned to the querying node.",
                "The returning reply packet also updates the pheromone table at each node on its return trip by increasing the pheromone value in the entry whose resource ID and neighbor ID fields match the ID of the discovered resource and the previous hop, respectively.",
                "If such an entry does not exist, a new entry is added into the table.",
                "Therefore, subsequent query packets looking for the same resource, when encountering this pheromone information, are then guided toward the same destination with a small probability of taking an alternate path.",
                "Since the hybrid discovery scheme neither relies on a MANET routing protocol nor arranges nodes into a logical overlay, query packets are to traverse the actual network topology.",
                "In dense networks, relatively large nodal degrees can have potential impacts on this random exploring mechanism.",
                "To address this issue, the hybrid scheme also incorporates proactive advertisement in addition to the reactive query.",
                "To perform proactive advertisement, each node periodically deploys an advertising packet containing a list of its available resources IDs.",
                "These packets will traverse away from the advertising node in a random walk manner up to a limited number of hops and advertise resource information to surrounding nodes in the same way as reply packets.",
                "In the hybrid scheme, an increase of pheromone serves as a positive feedback which indirectly guides query packets looking for similar resources.",
                "Intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well.",
                "Each node also performs an implicit <br>negative feedback</br> for resources that have not been given a positive feedback for some time by regularly decreasing the pheromone in all of its pheromone table entries over time.",
                "In addition, pheromone can be reduced by an explicit negative response, for instance, a reply packet returning from a node that is not willing to provide a resource due to excessive workload.",
                "As a result, load balancing can be achieved via positive and <br>negative feedback</br>.",
                "A node serving too many nodes can either return fewer responses to query packets or generate negative responses. 2 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 Figure 1: Example illustrating neighbor and pheromone tables maintained by node A: (a) wireless connectivity around A showing that it currently has four neighbors, (b) As neighbor table, and (c) a possible pheromone table of A Figure 2: Sample scenarios illustrating the three mechanisms supporting load-balancing: (a) resource replication, (b) resource relocation, and (c) resource division 4.",
                "RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION In addition to resource discovery, a querying node usually attempts to access and retrieve the contents of a resource after a successful discovery.",
                "In certain situations, it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the resource can be relocated and/or replicated, such as data files.",
                "Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well.",
                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
                "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
                "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
                "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
                "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
                "Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
                "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
                "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",
                "If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure.",
                "Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized.",
                "The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 3 The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates resource relocation algorithms that are adaptive to user requests and aim to reduce communication overhead.",
                "Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources.",
                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
                "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",
                "Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated.",
                "The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5.",
                "REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete.",
                "Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both.",
                "The lack of infrastructure supports and frequent topology changes in MANETs further challenge the issue.",
                "We apply the same cross-layer paradigm to invalidating replicas in MANETs which allows concurrent updates performed by multiple replicas.",
                "To coordinate concurrent updates and disseminate replica invalidations, a special infrastructure, called validation mesh or mesh for short, is adaptively maintained among nodes possessing valid replicas of a resource.",
                "Once a node has updated its replica, an invalidation packet will only be disseminated over the validation mesh to inform other replica-possessing nodes that their replicas become invalid and should be deleted.",
                "The structure (topology) of the validation mesh keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move.",
                "To accommodate the dynamics, our scheme integrates the components of swarm intelligence to adaptively maintain the validation mesh without relying on any underlying MANET routing protocol.",
                "In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas.",
                "In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica.",
                "Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively facilitates concurrent replica updates and efficiently perform replica invalidation without incurring network-wide flooding.",
                "Figure 3 depicts the idea of validation mesh which maintains connectivity among nodes holding valid replicas of a resource to avoid network-wide flooding when invalidating replicas.",
                "Figure 3: Examples showing maintenance of validation mesh There are eight nodes in the sample network, and we start with only node A holding the valid file, as shown in Figure 3(a).",
                "Later on, node G issues a query packet for the file and eventually obtains the file from A via nodes B and D. Since intermediate nodes are allowed to cache forwarded data, nodes B, D, and G will now hold valid replicas of the file.",
                "As a result, a validation mesh is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b).",
                "In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node Bs cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the validation mesh.",
                "Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an invalidation packet over the validation mesh.",
                "Consequently, all other nodes except G remove their replicas of the file from their storage and the validation mesh is torn down.",
                "However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
                "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",
                "Eventually, a new validation mesh is established over nodes G, B, D, E, and H. To maintain a validation mesh among the nodes holding valid replicas, one of them is designated to be the focal node.",
                "Initially, the node that originally holds the data is the focal node.",
                "As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node.",
                "We also name nodes, such as G and H, who originate requests to replicate data as clients, and nodes B, D, and E who locally cache passing data as data nodes.",
                "For instance, in Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), node A is the focal node; in Figures 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f), node G becomes the focal node.",
                "In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the validation mesh.",
                "If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesnt hear a keep-alive packet for a certain time interval, it will deploy a search packet using the resource discovery mechanism described in Section 3 to find another node (termed attachment point) currently on the validation mesh so that it can attach itself to.",
                "Once an attachment point is found, a search_reply packet is returned to the disconnected node who originated the search.",
                "Intermediate nodes who forward the search_reply packet will become part of the validation mesh as well.",
                "To illustrate the effect of node mobility, in Figure 3(f), node H has moved to a location where it is not directly connected to the mesh.",
                "Via the resource discovery mechanism, node H relies on an intermediate node F to connect itself to the mesh.",
                "Here, node F, although part of the validation mesh, doesnt hold data replica, and hence is termed nondata node.",
                "Client and data node who keep hearing the keep-alive packets from the focal node act as if they are holding a valid replica, so that they can reply to query packets, like node B in Figure 3(c) replying a request from node H. While a disconnected node attempting to discover an attachment point to reattach itself to the mesh, the disconnected node cant reply to a query packet.",
                "For instance, in Figure 3(f), node H does not reply to any query packet before it reattaches itself to the mesh.",
                "Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.",
                "Without relying on any MANET routing protocols, the two primitives work together to facilitate efficient search and adaptive maintenance. 6.",

                "In Figure 4, the overhead increases as the speed increase, which is due to the fact that as the speed increase, nodes move out of mesh more frequently, and will send out more search packets.",

                "In contrast, the packets will be expected to be more than 200 packets at various speeds when flooding is used.",
                "Figure 5 shows that the overhead almost remains the same under various densities.",
                "That is attributed to only flooding over the mesh instead of the whole network.",
                "The size of mesh doesnt vary much on various densities, so that the overhead doesnt vary much.",
                "Figure 6 shows that overhead also almost remains the same under various maximum number of concurrent updates.",
                "Thats because one more node just means one more flood over the mesh during update process so that the impact is limited.",
                "Figure 7 shows that if updates happen more frequently, the overhead is higher.",
                "This is because the more quickly updates happen, (1) there will be more keep_alive message over the mesh between two updates, and (2) nodes move out of mesh more frequently and send out more search packets.",
                "Figures 8, 9, 10, and 11 show the delay versus various parameter values.",
                "From Figure 8, we know the delay increases as the speed increases, which is due to the fact that with increasing speed, clients will move out of mesh with higher probability.",

                "The faster the speed, the more time clients need to spend to search the mesh.",
                "Figure 9 shows that delay is negligibly affected by the density.",
                "Delay decreases slightly as the number of nodes increases, due to the fact that the more nodes in the network, the more nodes receives the advertisement packets which helps the search packet find the target so that the delay of update decreases.",
                "Figure 10 shows that delay decreases slightly as the maximum number of concurrent updates increases.",
                "The larger the maximum number of concurrent updates is, the more nodes are picked up to do update.",
                "Then with higher probability, one of these nodes is still in mesh and finishes the update immediately (dont need to search mesh first), which decreases the delay.",

                "In the hybrid scheme, an increase of pheromone serves as a positive feedback which indirectly guides query packets looking for similar resources.",
                "Intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well.",
                "Each node also performs an implicit negative feedback for resources that have not been given a positive feedback for some time by regularly decreasing the pheromone in all of its pheromone table entries over time.",
                "In addition, pheromone can be reduced by an explicit negative response, for instance, a reply packet returning from a node that is not willing to provide a resource due to excessive workload.",

                "Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well.",
                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
                "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
                "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
                "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
                "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
                "Unlike a <br>query packet</br> which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
                "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
                "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",
                "If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure.",
                "Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized.",
                "The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 3 The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates resource relocation algorithms that are adaptive to user requests and aim to reduce communication overhead.",
                "Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources.",
                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
                "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",
                "Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated.",
                "The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5.",
                "REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete.",
                "Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both.",
                "The lack of infrastructure supports and frequent topology changes in MANETs further challenge the issue.",

                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",

                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",

                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",

                "However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
                "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",
                "Eventually, a new validation mesh is established over nodes G, B, D, E, and H. To maintain a validation mesh among the nodes holding valid replicas, one of them is designated to be the focal node.",

                "As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node.",

                "In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the validation mesh.",
                "If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesnt hear a keep-alive packet for a certain time interval, it will deploy a search packet using the resource discovery mechanism described in Section 3 to find another node (termed attachment point) currently on the validation mesh so that it can attach itself to.",

                "Without relying on any existing, pre-configured network infrastructure or centralized control, MANETs are useful in situations where impromptu communication facilities are required, such as battlefield communications and disaster relief missions.",
                "As MANET applications demand collaborative processing and information sharing among mobile nodes, resource (service) discovery and distribution have become indispensable capabilities.",
                "One approach to designing resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs is to construct a peer-to-peer (P2P) system (or an overlay) which organizes peers of the system into a logical structure, on top of the actual network topology.",
                "However, deploying such P2P systems over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the reactive routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth utilization in proactive routing schemes.",
                "Either way, constructing an overlay will potentially create a scalability problem for large-scale MANETs.",
                "Due to the dynamic nature of MANETs, P2P systems should be robust by being scalable and adaptive to topology changes.",
                "These systems should also provide efficient and effective ways for peers to interact, as well as other desirable application specific features.",

                "When traversing a route, these control packets measure goodness of the route and leave feedback information on each node along the way to guide subsequent control packets to appropriate directions. 2.",

                "RELATED WORK For MANETs, P2P systems can be classified based on the design principle, into layered and cross-layer approaches.",
                "A layered approach adopts a P2P-like [1] solution, where resource discovery is facilitated as an application layer protocol and query/reply messages are delivered by the underlying MANET routing protocols.",
                "For instance, Konark [2] makes use of a underlying multicast protocol such that service providers and queriers advertise and search services via a predefined multicast group, respectively.",

                "It defines a transport protocol that sits on top of the existing TCP/IP stack, hence relying on an existing routing protocol to operate.",
                "With limited control over how control and data packets are routed in the network, it is difficult to avoid the inefficiency of the general-purpose routing protocols which are often reactive and flooding-based.",
                "In contrast, cross-layer approaches either relies on its own routing mechanism or augments existing MANET routing algorithms to support resource discovery. 7DS [4], which is the pioneering work deploying P2P system on mobile devices, exploits data locality and node mobility to dissemination data in a single-hop fashion.",
                "Hence, long search latency may be resulted as a 7DS node can get data of interest only if the node that holds the data is in its radio coverage.",

                "In this way, the number of control packets on the network is constrained, thus providing good scalability.",
                "Despite the mechanism to reduce control packets, high overhead may still be unavoidable, especially when there are many clients trying to locate different services, due to the fact that the algorithm relies on flooding, For resource replication, Yin and Cao [6] design and evaluate cooperative caching techniques for MANETs.",

                "If a server detects the number of requests exceed a threshold within a time period, it begins to replicate its data onto nodes capable of storing replicas, whose hop counts from the server are of certain values.",
                "Since data replication is triggered by the request frequency alone, it is possible that there are replicas unnecessarily created in a large scope even though only nodes within a small range request this data.",
                "Our proposed resource replication mechanism, in contrast, attempts to replicate a data item in appropriate areas, instead of a large area around the server, where the item is requested frequently. 3.",
                "RESOURCE DISCOVERY We propose a cross-layer, hybrid resource discovery scheme that relies on the multiple interactions of query, reply and advertisement packets.",
                "We assume that each resource is associated with a unique ID1 .",
                "Initially, when a node wants to discover a resource, it deploys query packets, which carry the corresponding resource ID, and randomly explore the network to search for the requested resource.",
                "Upon receiving such a query packet, a reply packet is generated by the node providing the requested resource.",
                "Advertisement packets can also be used to proactively inform other nodes about what resources are available at each node.",
                "In addition to discovering the identity of the node providing the requested resource, it may be also necessary to discover a route leading to this node for further interaction.",
                "To allow intermediate nodes to make a decision on where to forward query packets, each node maintains two tables: neighbor 1 The assumption of unique ID is made for brevity in exposition, and resources could be specified via attribute-value assertions. table and pheromone table.",
                "The neighbor table maintains a list of all current neighbors obtained via a neighbor discovery protocol.",
                "The pheromone table maintains the mapping of a resource ID and a neighbor ID to a pheromone value.",
                "This table is initially empty, and is updated by a reply packet generated by a successful query.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates an example of a neighbor table and a pheromone table maintained by node A having four neighbors.",
                "When node A receives a query packet searching for a resource, it makes a decision to which neighbor it should forward the query packet by computing the desirability of each of the neighbors that have not been visited before by the same query packet.",
                "For a resource ID r, the desirability of choosing a neighbor n, δ(r,n), is obtained from the pheromone value of the entry whose neighbor and resource ID fields are n and r, respectively.",
                "If no such entry exists in the pheromone table, δ(r,n) is set to zero.",
                "Once the desirabilities of all valid next hops have been calculated, they are normalized to obtain the probability of choosing each neighbor.",
                "In addition, a small probability is also assigned to those neighbors with zero desirability to exercise the sporadic random walk primitive.",
                "Based on these probabilities, a next hop is selected to forward the query packet to.",
                "When a query packet encounters a node with a satisfying resource, a reply packet is returned to the querying node.",
                "The returning reply packet also updates the pheromone table at each node on its return trip by increasing the pheromone value in the entry whose resource ID and neighbor ID fields match the ID of the discovered resource and the previous hop, respectively.",
                "If such an entry does not exist, a new entry is added into the table.",
                "Therefore, subsequent query packets looking for the same resource, when encountering this pheromone information, are then guided toward the same destination with a small probability of taking an alternate path.",
                "Since the hybrid discovery scheme neither relies on a MANET routing protocol nor arranges nodes into a logical overlay, query packets are to traverse the actual network topology.",
                "In dense networks, relatively large nodal degrees can have potential impacts on this random exploring mechanism.",
                "To address this issue, the hybrid scheme also incorporates proactive advertisement in addition to the reactive query.",
                "To perform proactive advertisement, each node periodically deploys an advertising packet containing a list of its available resources IDs.",
                "These packets will traverse away from the advertising node in a random walk manner up to a limited number of hops and advertise resource information to surrounding nodes in the same way as reply packets.",
                "In the hybrid scheme, an increase of pheromone serves as a positive feedback which indirectly guides query packets looking for similar resources.",
                "Intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well.",
                "Each node also performs an implicit negative feedback for resources that have not been given a positive feedback for some time by regularly decreasing the pheromone in all of its pheromone table entries over time.",
                "In addition, pheromone can be reduced by an explicit negative response, for instance, a reply packet returning from a node that is not willing to provide a resource due to excessive workload.",
                "As a result, load balancing can be achieved via positive and negative feedback.",
                "A node serving too many nodes can either return fewer responses to query packets or generate negative responses. 2 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 Figure 1: Example illustrating neighbor and pheromone tables maintained by node A: (a) wireless connectivity around A showing that it currently has four neighbors, (b) As neighbor table, and (c) a possible pheromone table of A Figure 2: Sample scenarios illustrating the three mechanisms supporting load-balancing: (a) resource replication, (b) resource relocation, and (c) resource division 4.",
                "RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION In addition to resource discovery, a querying node usually attempts to access and retrieve the contents of a resource after a successful discovery.",
                "In certain situations, it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the resource can be relocated and/or replicated, such as data files.",
                "Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well.",
                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
                "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
                "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
                "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
                "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
                "Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
                "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
                "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",
                "If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure.",
                "Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized.",
                "The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 3 The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates resource relocation algorithms that are adaptive to user requests and aim to reduce communication overhead.",
                "Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources.",
                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
                "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",
                "Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated.",
                "The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5.",
                "REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete.",
                "Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both.",
                "The lack of infrastructure supports and frequent topology changes in MANETs further challenge the issue.",
                "We apply the same cross-layer paradigm to invalidating replicas in MANETs which allows concurrent updates performed by multiple replicas.",
                "To coordinate concurrent updates and disseminate replica invalidations, a special infrastructure, called <br>validation mesh</br> or mesh for short, is adaptively maintained among nodes possessing valid replicas of a resource.",
                "Once a node has updated its replica, an invalidation packet will only be disseminated over the <br>validation mesh</br> to inform other replica-possessing nodes that their replicas become invalid and should be deleted.",
                "The structure (topology) of the <br>validation mesh</br> keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move.",
                "To accommodate the dynamics, our scheme integrates the components of swarm intelligence to adaptively maintain the <br>validation mesh</br> without relying on any underlying MANET routing protocol.",
                "In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas.",
                "In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica.",
                "Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively facilitates concurrent replica updates and efficiently perform replica invalidation without incurring network-wide flooding.",
                "Figure 3 depicts the idea of <br>validation mesh</br> which maintains connectivity among nodes holding valid replicas of a resource to avoid network-wide flooding when invalidating replicas.",
                "Figure 3: Examples showing maintenance of <br>validation mesh</br> There are eight nodes in the sample network, and we start with only node A holding the valid file, as shown in Figure 3(a).",
                "Later on, node G issues a query packet for the file and eventually obtains the file from A via nodes B and D. Since intermediate nodes are allowed to cache forwarded data, nodes B, D, and G will now hold valid replicas of the file.",
                "As a result, a <br>validation mesh</br> is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b).",
                "In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node Bs cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the <br>validation mesh</br>.",
                "Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an invalidation packet over the <br>validation mesh</br>.",
                "Consequently, all other nodes except G remove their replicas of the file from their storage and the <br>validation mesh</br> is torn down.",
                "However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
                "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",
                "Eventually, a new <br>validation mesh</br> is established over nodes G, B, D, E, and H. To maintain a <br>validation mesh</br> among the nodes holding valid replicas, one of them is designated to be the focal node.",
                "Initially, the node that originally holds the data is the focal node.",
                "As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node.",
                "We also name nodes, such as G and H, who originate requests to replicate data as clients, and nodes B, D, and E who locally cache passing data as data nodes.",
                "For instance, in Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), node A is the focal node; in Figures 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f), node G becomes the focal node.",
                "In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the <br>validation mesh</br> with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the <br>validation mesh</br>.",
                "If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesnt hear a keep-alive packet for a certain time interval, it will deploy a search packet using the resource discovery mechanism described in Section 3 to find another node (termed attachment point) currently on the <br>validation mesh</br> so that it can attach itself to.",
                "Once an attachment point is found, a search_reply packet is returned to the disconnected node who originated the search.",
                "Intermediate nodes who forward the search_reply packet will become part of the <br>validation mesh</br> as well.",
                "To illustrate the effect of node mobility, in Figure 3(f), node H has moved to a location where it is not directly connected to the mesh.",
                "Via the resource discovery mechanism, node H relies on an intermediate node F to connect itself to the mesh.",
                "Here, node F, although part of the <br>validation mesh</br>, doesnt hold data replica, and hence is termed nondata node.",
                "Client and data node who keep hearing the keep-alive packets from the focal node act as if they are holding a valid replica, so that they can reply to query packets, like node B in Figure 3(c) replying a request from node H. While a disconnected node attempting to discover an attachment point to reattach itself to the mesh, the disconnected node cant reply to a query packet.",
                "For instance, in Figure 3(f), node H does not reply to any query packet before it reattaches itself to the mesh.",
                "Although <br>validation mesh</br> provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.",
                "Without relying on any MANET routing protocols, the two primitives work together to facilitate efficient search and adaptive maintenance. 6.",

                "RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION In addition to resource discovery, a querying node usually attempts to access and retrieve the contents of a resource after a successful discovery.",
                "In certain situations, it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the resource can be relocated and/or replicated, such as data files.",
                "Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well.",
                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
                "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
                "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
                "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
                "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
                "Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
                "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
                "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",
                "If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure.",
                "Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized.",
                "The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 3 The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates resource relocation algorithms that are adaptive to user requests and aim to reduce communication overhead.",
                "Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources.",
                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
                "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",
                "Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated.",
                "The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5.",
                "REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete.",
                "Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both.",
                "The lack of infrastructure supports and frequent topology changes in MANETs further challenge the issue.",
                "We apply the same cross-layer paradigm to invalidating replicas in MANETs which allows concurrent updates performed by multiple replicas.",
                "To coordinate concurrent updates and disseminate replica invalidations, a special infrastructure, called validation mesh or mesh for short, is adaptively maintained among nodes possessing valid replicas of a resource.",
                "Once a node has updated its replica, an <br>invalidation packet</br> will only be disseminated over the validation mesh to inform other replica-possessing nodes that their replicas become invalid and should be deleted.",
                "The structure (topology) of the validation mesh keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move.",
                "To accommodate the dynamics, our scheme integrates the components of swarm intelligence to adaptively maintain the validation mesh without relying on any underlying MANET routing protocol.",
                "In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas.",
                "In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica.",
                "Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively facilitates concurrent replica updates and efficiently perform replica invalidation without incurring network-wide flooding.",
                "Figure 3 depicts the idea of validation mesh which maintains connectivity among nodes holding valid replicas of a resource to avoid network-wide flooding when invalidating replicas.",
                "Figure 3: Examples showing maintenance of validation mesh There are eight nodes in the sample network, and we start with only node A holding the valid file, as shown in Figure 3(a).",
                "Later on, node G issues a query packet for the file and eventually obtains the file from A via nodes B and D. Since intermediate nodes are allowed to cache forwarded data, nodes B, D, and G will now hold valid replicas of the file.",
                "As a result, a validation mesh is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b).",
                "In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node Bs cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the validation mesh.",
                "Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an <br>invalidation packet</br> over the validation mesh.",
                "Consequently, all other nodes except G remove their replicas of the file from their storage and the validation mesh is torn down.",
                "However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
                "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",
                "Eventually, a new validation mesh is established over nodes G, B, D, E, and H. To maintain a validation mesh among the nodes holding valid replicas, one of them is designated to be the focal node.",
                "Initially, the node that originally holds the data is the focal node.",
                "As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node.",
                "We also name nodes, such as G and H, who originate requests to replicate data as clients, and nodes B, D, and E who locally cache passing data as data nodes.",
                "For instance, in Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), node A is the focal node; in Figures 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f), node G becomes the focal node.",
                "In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the validation mesh.",
                "If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesnt hear a keep-alive packet for a certain time interval, it will deploy a search packet using the resource discovery mechanism described in Section 3 to find another node (termed attachment point) currently on the validation mesh so that it can attach itself to.",
                "Once an attachment point is found, a search_reply packet is returned to the disconnected node who originated the search.",
                "Intermediate nodes who forward the search_reply packet will become part of the validation mesh as well.",
                "To illustrate the effect of node mobility, in Figure 3(f), node H has moved to a location where it is not directly connected to the mesh.",
                "Via the resource discovery mechanism, node H relies on an intermediate node F to connect itself to the mesh.",
                "Here, node F, although part of the validation mesh, doesnt hold data replica, and hence is termed nondata node.",
                "Client and data node who keep hearing the keep-alive packets from the focal node act as if they are holding a valid replica, so that they can reply to query packets, like node B in Figure 3(c) replying a request from node H. While a disconnected node attempting to discover an attachment point to reattach itself to the mesh, the disconnected node cant reply to a query packet.",
                "For instance, in Figure 3(f), node H does not reply to any query packet before it reattaches itself to the mesh.",
                "Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.",

                "Without relying on any existing, pre-configured network infrastructure or centralized control, MANETs are useful in situations where impromptu communication facilities are required, such as battlefield communications and disaster relief missions.",
                "As MANET applications demand collaborative processing and information sharing among mobile nodes, resource (service) discovery and distribution have become indispensable capabilities.",
                "One approach to designing resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs is to construct a peer-to-peer (P2P) system (or an overlay) which organizes peers of the system into a logical structure, on top of the actual network topology.",
                "However, deploying such P2P systems over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the reactive routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth utilization in proactive routing schemes.",
                "Either way, constructing an overlay will potentially create a scalability problem for large-scale MANETs.",
                "Due to the dynamic nature of MANETs, P2P systems should be robust by being scalable and adaptive to topology changes.",
                "These systems should also provide efficient and effective ways for peers to interact, as well as other desirable application specific features.",

                "With limited control over how control and data packets are routed in the network, it is difficult to avoid the inefficiency of the general-purpose routing protocols which are often reactive and flooding-based.",
                "In contrast, cross-layer approaches either relies on its own routing mechanism or augments existing MANET routing algorithms to support resource discovery. 7DS [4], which is the pioneering work deploying P2P system on mobile devices, exploits data locality and node mobility to dissemination data in a single-hop fashion.",

                "Despite the mechanism to reduce control packets, high overhead may still be unavoidable, especially when there are many clients trying to locate different services, due to the fact that the algorithm relies on flooding, For resource replication, Yin and Cao [6] design and evaluate cooperative caching techniques for MANETs.",

                "If a server detects the number of requests exceed a threshold within a time period, it begins to replicate its data onto nodes capable of storing replicas, whose hop counts from the server are of certain values.",
                "Since data replication is triggered by the request frequency alone, it is possible that there are replicas unnecessarily created in a large scope even though only nodes within a small range request this data.",
                "Our proposed resource replication mechanism, in contrast, attempts to replicate a data item in appropriate areas, instead of a large area around the server, where the item is requested frequently. 3.",
                "RESOURCE DISCOVERY We propose a cross-layer, hybrid resource discovery scheme that relies on the multiple interactions of query, reply and advertisement packets.",
                "We assume that each resource is associated with a unique ID1 .",
                "Initially, when a node wants to discover a resource, it deploys query packets, which carry the corresponding resource ID, and randomly explore the network to search for the requested resource.",
                "Upon receiving such a query packet, a reply packet is generated by the node providing the requested resource.",
                "Advertisement packets can also be used to proactively inform other nodes about what resources are available at each node.",
                "In addition to discovering the identity of the node providing the requested resource, it may be also necessary to discover a route leading to this node for further interaction.",
                "To allow intermediate nodes to make a decision on where to forward query packets, each node maintains two tables: neighbor 1 The assumption of unique ID is made for brevity in exposition, and resources could be specified via attribute-value assertions. table and pheromone table.",
                "The neighbor table maintains a list of all current neighbors obtained via a neighbor discovery protocol.",
                "The pheromone table maintains the mapping of a resource ID and a neighbor ID to a pheromone value.",
                "This table is initially empty, and is updated by a reply packet generated by a successful query.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates an example of a neighbor table and a pheromone table maintained by node A having four neighbors.",
                "When node A receives a query packet searching for a resource, it makes a decision to which neighbor it should forward the query packet by computing the desirability of each of the neighbors that have not been visited before by the same query packet.",
                "For a resource ID r, the desirability of choosing a neighbor n, δ(r,n), is obtained from the pheromone value of the entry whose neighbor and resource ID fields are n and r, respectively.",
                "If no such entry exists in the pheromone table, δ(r,n) is set to zero.",
                "Once the desirabilities of all valid next hops have been calculated, they are normalized to obtain the probability of choosing each neighbor.",
                "In addition, a small probability is also assigned to those neighbors with zero desirability to exercise the sporadic random walk primitive.",
                "Based on these probabilities, a next hop is selected to forward the query packet to.",
                "When a query packet encounters a node with a satisfying resource, a reply packet is returned to the querying node.",
                "The returning reply packet also updates the pheromone table at each node on its return trip by increasing the pheromone value in the entry whose resource ID and neighbor ID fields match the ID of the discovered resource and the previous hop, respectively.",
                "If such an entry does not exist, a new entry is added into the table.",
                "Therefore, subsequent query packets looking for the same resource, when encountering this pheromone information, are then guided toward the same destination with a small probability of taking an alternate path.",
                "Since the hybrid discovery scheme neither relies on a MANET routing protocol nor arranges nodes into a logical overlay, query packets are to traverse the actual network topology.",
                "In dense networks, relatively large nodal degrees can have potential impacts on this random exploring mechanism.",
                "To address this issue, the hybrid scheme also incorporates proactive advertisement in addition to the reactive query.",
                "To perform proactive advertisement, each node periodically deploys an advertising packet containing a list of its available resources IDs.",
                "These packets will traverse away from the advertising node in a random walk manner up to a limited number of hops and advertise resource information to surrounding nodes in the same way as reply packets.",
                "In the hybrid scheme, an increase of pheromone serves as a positive feedback which indirectly guides query packets looking for similar resources.",
                "Intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well.",
                "Each node also performs an implicit negative feedback for resources that have not been given a positive feedback for some time by regularly decreasing the pheromone in all of its pheromone table entries over time.",
                "In addition, pheromone can be reduced by an explicit negative response, for instance, a reply packet returning from a node that is not willing to provide a resource due to excessive workload.",
                "As a result, load balancing can be achieved via positive and negative feedback.",
                "A node serving too many nodes can either return fewer responses to query packets or generate negative responses. 2 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 Figure 1: Example illustrating neighbor and pheromone tables maintained by node A: (a) wireless connectivity around A showing that it currently has four neighbors, (b) As neighbor table, and (c) a possible pheromone table of A Figure 2: Sample scenarios illustrating the three mechanisms supporting load-balancing: (a) resource replication, (b) resource relocation, and (c) resource division 4.",
                "RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION In addition to resource discovery, a querying node usually attempts to access and retrieve the contents of a resource after a successful discovery.",
                "In certain situations, it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the resource can be relocated and/or replicated, such as data files.",
                "Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well.",
                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
                "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
                "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
                "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
                "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
                "Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
                "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
                "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",
                "If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure.",
                "Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized.",
                "The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 3 The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates resource relocation algorithms that are adaptive to user requests and aim to reduce communication overhead.",
                "Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources.",
                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
                "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",
                "Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated.",
                "The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5.",
                "REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete.",
                "Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both.",
                "The lack of infrastructure supports and frequent topology changes in MANETs further challenge the issue.",
                "We apply the same cross-layer paradigm to invalidating replicas in MANETs which allows concurrent updates performed by multiple replicas.",
                "To coordinate concurrent updates and disseminate replica invalidations, a special infrastructure, called validation mesh or mesh for short, is adaptively maintained among nodes possessing valid replicas of a resource.",
                "Once a node has updated its replica, an invalidation packet will only be disseminated over the validation mesh to inform other replica-possessing nodes that their replicas become invalid and should be deleted.",
                "The structure (topology) of the validation mesh keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move.",
                "To accommodate the dynamics, our scheme integrates the components of swarm intelligence to adaptively maintain the validation mesh without relying on any underlying MANET routing protocol.",
                "In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas.",
                "In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica.",
                "Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively facilitates concurrent replica updates and efficiently perform replica invalidation without incurring network-wide flooding.",
                "Figure 3 depicts the idea of validation mesh which maintains connectivity among nodes holding valid replicas of a resource to avoid network-wide flooding when invalidating replicas.",
                "Figure 3: Examples showing maintenance of validation mesh There are eight nodes in the sample network, and we start with only node A holding the valid file, as shown in Figure 3(a).",
                "Later on, node G issues a query packet for the file and eventually obtains the file from A via nodes B and D. Since intermediate nodes are allowed to cache forwarded data, nodes B, D, and G will now hold valid replicas of the file.",
                "As a result, a validation mesh is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b).",
                "In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node Bs cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the validation mesh.",
                "Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an invalidation packet over the validation mesh.",
                "Consequently, all other nodes except G remove their replicas of the file from their storage and the validation mesh is torn down.",
                "However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
                "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",
                "Eventually, a new validation mesh is established over nodes G, B, D, E, and H. To maintain a validation mesh among the nodes holding valid replicas, one of them is designated to be the focal node.",
                "Initially, the node that originally holds the data is the focal node.",
                "As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node.",
                "We also name nodes, such as G and H, who originate requests to replicate data as clients, and nodes B, D, and E who locally cache passing data as data nodes.",
                "For instance, in Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), node A is the focal node; in Figures 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f), node G becomes the focal node.",
                "In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the validation mesh.",
                "If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesnt hear a keep-alive packet for a certain time interval, it will deploy a search packet using the resource discovery mechanism described in Section 3 to find another node (termed attachment point) currently on the validation mesh so that it can attach itself to.",
                "Once an attachment point is found, a search_reply packet is returned to the disconnected node who originated the search.",
                "Intermediate nodes who forward the search_reply packet will become part of the validation mesh as well.",
                "To illustrate the effect of node mobility, in Figure 3(f), node H has moved to a location where it is not directly connected to the mesh.",
                "Via the resource discovery mechanism, node H relies on an intermediate node F to connect itself to the mesh.",
                "Here, node F, although part of the validation mesh, doesnt hold data replica, and hence is termed nondata node.",
                "Client and data node who keep hearing the keep-alive packets from the focal node act as if they are holding a valid replica, so that they can reply to query packets, like node B in Figure 3(c) replying a request from node H. While a disconnected node attempting to discover an attachment point to reattach itself to the mesh, the disconnected node cant reply to a query packet.",
                "For instance, in Figure 3(f), node H does not reply to any query packet before it reattaches itself to the mesh.",
                "Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.",
                "Without relying on any MANET routing protocols, the two primitives work together to facilitate efficient search and adaptive maintenance. 6.",
                "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION We have conducted simulation experiments using the QualNet simulator to evaluate the performance of the described resource discovery, resource distribution, and replica invalidation schemes.",
                "However, due to space limitation only the performance of the replica invalidation is reported.",

                "Intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well.",

                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
                "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
                "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
                "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
                "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
                "Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
                "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
                "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",

                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
                "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",

                "In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas.",
                "In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica.",

In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
                "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",

                "Based on these probabilities, a next hop is selected to forward the query packet to.",
                "When a query packet encounters a node with a satisfying resource, a reply packet is returned to the querying node.",
                "The returning reply packet also updates the pheromone table at each node on its return trip by increasing the pheromone value in the entry whose resource ID and neighbor ID fields match the ID of the discovered resource and the previous hop, respectively.",
                "If such an entry does not exist, a new entry is added into the table.",
                "Therefore, subsequent query packets looking for the same resource, when encountering this pheromone information, are then guided toward the same destination with a small probability of taking an alternate path.",
                "Since the hybrid discovery scheme neither relies on a MANET routing protocol nor arranges nodes into a logical overlay, query packets are to traverse the actual network topology.",
                "In dense networks, relatively large nodal degrees can have potential impacts on this random exploring mechanism.",
                "To address this issue, the hybrid scheme also incorporates proactive advertisement in addition to the reactive query.",
                "To perform proactive advertisement, each node periodically deploys an advertising packet containing a list of its available resources IDs.",
                "These packets will traverse away from the advertising node in a random walk manner up to a limited number of hops and advertise resource information to surrounding nodes in the same way as reply packets.",
                "In the hybrid scheme, an increase of pheromone serves as a positive feedback which indirectly guides query packets looking for similar resources.",
                "Intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well.",
                "Each node also performs an implicit negative feedback for resources that have not been given a positive feedback for some time by regularly decreasing the pheromone in all of its pheromone table entries over time.",
                "In addition, pheromone can be reduced by an explicit negative response, for instance, a reply packet returning from a node that is not willing to provide a resource due to excessive workload.",
                "As a result, load balancing can be achieved via positive and negative feedback.",

                "RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION In addition to <br>resource discovery</br>, a querying node usually attempts to access and retrieve the contents of a resource after a successful discovery.",
                "In certain situations, it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the resource can be relocated and/or replicated, such as data files.",
                "Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well.",
                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
                "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
                "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
                "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
                "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
                "Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
                "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
                "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",
                "If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure.",
                "Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized.",
                "The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 3 The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates resource relocation algorithms that are adaptive to user requests and aim to reduce communication overhead.",
                "Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources.",
                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
                "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",
                "Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated.",
                "The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5.",
                "REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete.",
                "Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both.",
                "The lack of infrastructure supports and frequent topology changes in MANETs further challenge the issue.",
                "We apply the same cross-layer paradigm to invalidating replicas in MANETs which allows concurrent updates performed by multiple replicas.",
                "To coordinate concurrent updates and disseminate replica invalidations, a special infrastructure, called validation mesh or mesh for short, is adaptively maintained among nodes possessing valid replicas of a resource.",
                "Once a node has updated its replica, an invalidation packet will only be disseminated over the validation mesh to inform other replica-possessing nodes that their replicas become invalid and should be deleted.",
                "The structure (topology) of the validation mesh keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move.",
                "To accommodate the dynamics, our scheme integrates the components of swarm intelligence to adaptively maintain the validation mesh without relying on any underlying MANET routing protocol.",
                "In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas.",
                "In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica.",
                "Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively facilitates concurrent replica updates and efficiently perform replica invalidation without incurring network-wide flooding.",
                "Figure 3 depicts the idea of validation mesh which maintains connectivity among nodes holding valid replicas of a resource to avoid network-wide flooding when invalidating replicas.",
                "Figure 3: Examples showing maintenance of validation mesh There are eight nodes in the sample network, and we start with only node A holding the valid file, as shown in Figure 3(a).",
                "Later on, node G issues a query packet for the file and eventually obtains the file from A via nodes B and D. Since intermediate nodes are allowed to cache forwarded data, nodes B, D, and G will now hold valid replicas of the file.",
                "As a result, a validation mesh is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b).",
                "In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node Bs cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the validation mesh.",
                "Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an invalidation packet over the validation mesh.",
                "Consequently, all other nodes except G remove their replicas of the file from their storage and the validation mesh is torn down.",
                "However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
                "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",
                "Eventually, a new validation mesh is established over nodes G, B, D, E, and H. To maintain a validation mesh among the nodes holding valid replicas, one of them is designated to be the focal node.",
                "Initially, the node that originally holds the data is the focal node.",
                "As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node.",
                "We also name nodes, such as G and H, who originate requests to replicate data as clients, and nodes B, D, and E who locally cache passing data as data nodes.",
                "For instance, in Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), node A is the focal node; in Figures 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f), node G becomes the focal node.",
                "In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the validation mesh.",
                "If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesnt hear a keep-alive packet for a certain time interval, it will deploy a search packet using the <br>resource discovery</br> mechanism described in Section 3 to find another node (termed attachment point) currently on the validation mesh so that it can attach itself to.",
                "Once an attachment point is found, a search_reply packet is returned to the disconnected node who originated the search.",
                "Intermediate nodes who forward the search_reply packet will become part of the validation mesh as well.",
                "To illustrate the effect of node mobility, in Figure 3(f), node H has moved to a location where it is not directly connected to the mesh.",
                "Via the <br>resource discovery</br> mechanism, node H relies on an intermediate node F to connect itself to the mesh.",
                "Here, node F, although part of the validation mesh, doesnt hold data replica, and hence is termed nondata node.",
                "Client and data node who keep hearing the keep-alive packets from the focal node act as if they are holding a valid replica, so that they can reply to query packets, like node B in Figure 3(c) replying a request from node H. While a disconnected node attempting to discover an attachment point to reattach itself to the mesh, the disconnected node cant reply to a query packet.",
                "For instance, in Figure 3(f), node H does not reply to any query packet before it reattaches itself to the mesh.",
                "Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.",

                "In the case of a reactive routing protocol, routing on the overlay may cause a large number of flooded route discovery message since the routing path in each routing step must be discovered on demand.",

                "As MANET applications demand collaborative processing and information sharing among mobile nodes, resource (service) discovery and distribution have become indispensable capabilities.",
                "One approach to designing resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs is to construct a peer-to-peer (P2P) system (or an overlay) which organizes peers of the system into a logical structure, on top of the actual network topology.",
                "However, deploying such P2P systems over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the reactive routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth utilization in proactive routing schemes.",

                "Initially, when a node wants to discover a resource, it deploys query packets, which carry the corresponding resource ID, and randomly explore the network to search for the requested resource.",
                "Upon receiving such a query packet, a reply packet is generated by the node providing the requested resource.",
                "Advertisement packets can also be used to proactively inform other nodes about what resources are available at each node.",
                "In addition to discovering the identity of the node providing the requested resource, it may be also necessary to discover a route leading to this node for further interaction.",
                "To allow intermediate nodes to make a decision on where to forward query packets, each node maintains two tables: neighbor 1 The assumption of unique ID is made for brevity in exposition, and resources could be specified via attribute-value assertions. table and pheromone table.",
                "The neighbor table maintains a list of all current neighbors obtained via a neighbor discovery protocol.",
                "The pheromone table maintains the mapping of a resource ID and a neighbor ID to a pheromone value.",
                "This table is initially empty, and is updated by a reply packet generated by a successful query.",

                "When node A receives a query packet searching for a resource, it makes a decision to which neighbor it should forward the query packet by computing the desirability of each of the neighbors that have not been visited before by the same query packet.",
                "For a resource ID r, the desirability of choosing a neighbor n, δ(r,n), is obtained from the pheromone value of the entry whose neighbor and resource ID fields are n and r, respectively.",
                "If no such entry exists in the pheromone table, δ(r,n) is set to zero.",
                "Once the desirabilities of all valid next hops have been calculated, they are normalized to obtain the probability of choosing each neighbor.",
                "In addition, a small probability is also assigned to those neighbors with zero desirability to exercise the sporadic random walk primitive.",
                "Based on these probabilities, a next hop is selected to forward the query packet to.",
                "When a query packet encounters a node with a satisfying resource, a reply packet is returned to the querying node.",
                "The returning reply packet also updates the pheromone table at each node on its return trip by increasing the pheromone value in the entry whose resource ID and neighbor ID fields match the ID of the discovered resource and the previous hop, respectively.",
                "If such an entry does not exist, a new entry is added into the table.",
                "Therefore, subsequent query packets looking for the same resource, when encountering this pheromone information, are then guided toward the same destination with a small probability of taking an alternate path.",
                "Since the hybrid discovery scheme neither relies on a MANET routing protocol nor arranges nodes into a logical overlay, query packets are to traverse the actual network topology.",
                "In dense networks, relatively large nodal degrees can have potential impacts on this random exploring mechanism.",
                "To address this issue, the hybrid scheme also incorporates proactive advertisement in addition to the reactive query.",
                "To perform proactive advertisement, each node periodically deploys an advertising packet containing a list of its available resources IDs.",
                "These packets will traverse away from the advertising node in a random walk manner up to a limited number of hops and advertise resource information to surrounding nodes in the same way as reply packets.",
                "In the hybrid scheme, an increase of pheromone serves as a positive feedback which indirectly guides query packets looking for similar resources.",
                "Intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well.",
                "Each node also performs an implicit negative feedback for resources that have not been given a positive feedback for some time by regularly decreasing the pheromone in all of its pheromone table entries over time.",
                "In addition, pheromone can be reduced by an explicit negative response, for instance, a reply packet returning from a node that is not willing to provide a resource due to excessive workload.",
                "As a result, load balancing can be achieved via positive and negative feedback.",
                "A node serving too many nodes can either return fewer responses to query packets or generate negative responses. 2 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 Figure 1: Example illustrating neighbor and pheromone tables maintained by node A: (a) wireless connectivity around A showing that it currently has four neighbors, (b) As neighbor table, and (c) a possible pheromone table of A Figure 2: Sample scenarios illustrating the three mechanisms supporting load-balancing: (a) resource replication, (b) resource relocation, and (c) resource division 4.",
                "RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION In addition to resource discovery, a querying node usually attempts to access and retrieve the contents of a resource after a successful discovery.",
                "In certain situations, it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the resource can be relocated and/or replicated, such as data files.",
                "Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well.",
                "Hence, we describe a cross-layer, hybrid resource distribution scheme to achieve load balancing by incorporating the functionalities of resource relocation, resource replication, and resource division. 4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.",
                "An example is when a node has obtained a data file from another node, the requesting node and the intermediate nodes can cache the file and start sharing that file with other surrounding nodes right away.",
                "In addition, replicable resources can also be proactively replicated at other nodes which are located in certain strategic areas.",
                "For instance, to help nodes find a resource quickly, we could replicate the resource so that it becomes reachable by random walk for a specific number of hops from any node with some probability, as depicted in Figure 2(a).",
                "To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.",
                "A resource replication packet of type R is deployed by a node that is providing the resource R itself.",
                "Unlike a query packet which follows higher pheromone upstream toward a resource it is looking for, a resource replication packet tends to be propelled away from similar resources by moving itself downstream toward weaker pheromone.",
                "When a resource replication packet finds itself in an area with sufficiently low pheromone, it makes a decision whether it should continue exploring or turn back.",
                "The decision depends on conditions such as current workload and/or remaining energy of the node being visited, as well as popularity of the resource itself. 4.2 Resource Relocation In certain situations, a resource may be required to transfer from one node to another.",
                "For example, a node may no longer want to possess a file due to the shortage of storage space, but it cannot simply delete the file since other nodes may still need it in the future.",
                "In this case, the node can choose to create replicas of the file by the aforementioned resource replication mechanism and then delete its own copy.",
                "Let us consider a situation where a majority of nodes requesting for a resource are located far away from a resource provider, as shown on the top of Figure 2(b).",
                "If the resource R is relocatable, it is preferred to be relocated to another area that is closer to those nodes, similar to the bottom of the same figure.",
                "Hence network bandwidth is more efficiently utilized.",
                "The 3rd Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 3 The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates resource relocation algorithms that are adaptive to user requests and aim to reduce communication overhead.",
                "Specifically, by following the same pheromone maintenance concept, the hybrid resource distribution scheme introduces another type of pheromone which corresponds to user requests, instead of resources.",
                "This type of pheromone, called request pheromone, is setup by query packets that are in their exploring phases (not returning ones) to guide a resource to a new location. 4.3 Resource Division Certain types of resources can be divided into smaller subresources (e.g., a large file being broken into smaller files) and distributed to multiple locations to avoid overloading a single node, as depicted in Figure 2(c).",
                "The hybrid resource distribution scheme incorporates a resource division mechanism that operates at a thin layer right above all the other mechanisms described earlier.",
                "The resource division mechanism is responsible for decomposing divisible resources into sub-resources, and then adds an extra keyword to distinguish each sub-resource from one another.",
                "Therefore, each of these sub-resources will be seen by the other mechanisms as one single resource which can be independently discovered, replicated, and relocated.",
                "The resource division mechanism is also responsible for combining data from these subresources together (e.g., merging pieces of a file) and delivering the final result to the application. 5.",
                "REPLICA INVALIDATION Although replicas improve accessibility and balance load, replica invalidation becomes a critical issue when nodes caching updatable resources may concurrently update their own replicas, which renders replicas held by other nodes obsolete.",
                "Most existing solutions to the replica invalidation problem either impose constrains that only the data source could perform update and invalidate other replicas, or resort to network-wide flooding which results in heavy network traffic and leads to scalability problem, or both.",
                "The lack of infrastructure supports and frequent topology changes in MANETs further challenge the issue.",
                "We apply the same cross-layer paradigm to invalidating replicas in MANETs which allows concurrent updates performed by multiple replicas.",
                "To coordinate concurrent updates and disseminate replica invalidations, a special infrastructure, called validation mesh or mesh for short, is adaptively maintained among nodes possessing valid replicas of a resource.",
                "Once a node has updated its replica, an invalidation packet will only be disseminated over the validation mesh to inform other replica-possessing nodes that their replicas become invalid and should be deleted.",
                "The structure (topology) of the validation mesh keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move.",
                "To accommodate the dynamics, our scheme integrates the components of swarm intelligence to adaptively maintain the validation mesh without relying on any underlying MANET routing protocol.",
                "In particular, the scheme takes into account concurrent updates initiated by multiple nodes to ensure the consistency among replicas.",
                "In addition, version number is used to distinguish new from old replicas when invalidating any stale replica.",
                "Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively facilitates concurrent replica updates and efficiently perform replica invalidation without incurring network-wide flooding.",
                "Figure 3 depicts the idea of validation mesh which maintains connectivity among nodes holding valid replicas of a resource to avoid network-wide flooding when invalidating replicas.",
                "Figure 3: Examples showing maintenance of validation mesh There are eight nodes in the sample network, and we start with only node A holding the valid file, as shown in Figure 3(a).",
                "Later on, node G issues a query packet for the file and eventually obtains the file from A via nodes B and D. Since intermediate nodes are allowed to cache forwarded data, nodes B, D, and G will now hold valid replicas of the file.",
                "As a result, a validation mesh is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b).",
                "In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node Bs cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the validation mesh.",
                "Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an invalidation packet over the validation mesh.",
                "Consequently, all other nodes except G remove their replicas of the file from their storage and the validation mesh is torn down.",
                "However, query forwarding pheromone, as denoted by the dotted arrows in Figure 3(d), is setup at these nodes via the reverse paths in which the invalidation packets have traversed, so that future requests for this file will be forwarded to node G. In Figure 3(e), node H makes a new request for the file again.",
                "This time, its query packet follows the pheromone toward node G, where the updated file can be obtained.",
                "Eventually, a new validation mesh is established over nodes G, B, D, E, and H. To maintain a validation mesh among the nodes holding valid replicas, one of them is designated to be the focal node.",
                "Initially, the node that originally holds the data is the focal node.",
                "As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node.",
                "We also name nodes, such as G and H, who originate requests to replicate data as clients, and nodes B, D, and E who locally cache passing data as data nodes.",
                "For instance, in Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), node A is the focal node; in Figures 3(d), 3(e), and 3(f), node G becomes the focal node.",
                "In addition, to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes, the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet, so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves to be part of the validation mesh.",
                "If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesnt hear a keep-alive packet for a certain time interval, it will deploy a search packet using the resource discovery mechanism described in Section 3 to find another node (termed attachment point) currently on the validation mesh so that it can attach itself to.",
                "Once an attachment point is found, a search_reply packet is returned to the disconnected node who originated the search.",
                "Intermediate nodes who forward the search_reply packet will become part of the validation mesh as well.",
                "To illustrate the effect of node mobility, in Figure 3(f), node H has moved to a location where it is not directly connected to the mesh.",
                "Via the resource discovery mechanism, node H relies on an intermediate node F to connect itself to the mesh.",
                "Here, node F, although part of the validation mesh, doesnt hold data replica, and hence is termed nondata node.",
                "Client and data node who keep hearing the keep-alive packets from the focal node act as if they are holding a valid replica, so that they can reply to query packets, like node B in Figure 3(c) replying a request from node H. While a disconnected node attempting to discover an attachment point to reattach itself to the mesh, the disconnected node cant reply to a query packet.",
                "For instance, in Figure 3(f), node H does not reply to any query packet before it reattaches itself to the mesh.",
                "Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.",
                "Without relying on any MANET routing protocols, the two primitives work together to facilitate efficient search and adaptive maintenance. 6.",

                "Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 show the overhead versus various parameter values.",
                "In Figure 4, the overhead increases as the speed increase, which is due to the fact that as the speed increase, nodes move out of mesh more frequently, and will send out more search packets.",
                "However, the overhead is not high, and even in speed 10m/sec, the overhead is below 100 packets.",
                "In contrast, the packets will be expected to be more than 200 packets at various speeds when flooding is used.",
                "Figure 5 shows that the overhead almost remains the same under various densities.",
                "That is attributed to only flooding over the mesh instead of the whole network.",
                "The size of mesh doesnt vary much on various densities, so that the overhead doesnt vary much.",
                "Figure 6 shows that overhead also almost remains the same under various maximum number of concurrent updates.",
                "Thats because one more node just means one more flood over the mesh during update process so that the impact is limited.",
                "Figure 7 shows that if updates happen more frequently, the overhead is higher.",
                "This is because the more quickly updates happen, (1) there will be more keep_alive message over the mesh between two updates, and (2) nodes move out of mesh more frequently and send out more search packets.",
                "Figures 8, 9, 10, and 11 show the delay versus various parameter values.",
                "From Figure 8, we know the delay increases as the speed increases, which is due to the fact that with increasing speed, clients will move out of mesh with higher probability.",
                "When these clients want to update data, they will spend time to first search the mesh.",
                "The faster the speed, the more time clients need to spend to search the mesh.",
                "Figure 9 shows that delay is negligibly affected by the density.",
                "Delay decreases slightly as the number of nodes increases, due to the fact that the more nodes in the network, the more nodes receives the advertisement packets which helps the search packet find the target so that the delay of update decreases.",
                "Figure 10 shows that delay decreases slightly as the maximum number of concurrent updates increases.",
                "The larger the maximum number of concurrent updates is, the more nodes are picked up to do update.",
                "Then with higher probability, one of these nodes is still in mesh and finishes the update immediately (dont need to search mesh first), which decreases the delay.",
                "Figure 11 shows how the delay varies with the update frequency.",
                "When updates happen more frequently, the delay will higher.",
                "Because the less frequently, the more time nodes in mesh have to move out of mesh then they need to take time to search the mesh when they do update, which increases the delay.",
                "The simulation results show that the replica invalidation scheme can significantly reduce the overhead with an acceptable delay. 7.",
                "CONCLUSION To facilitate resource discovery and distribution over MANETs, one approach is to designing peer-to-peer (P2P) systems over MANETs which constructs an overlay by organizing peers of the system into a logical structure on the top of MANETs physical topology.",
                "However, deploying overlay over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth usage.",
                "Specifically, overlay routing relies on the network-layer routing protocols.",
                "In the case of a reactive routing protocol, routing on the overlay may cause a large number of flooded route discovery message since the routing path in each routing step must be discovered on demand.",
                "On the other hand, if a proactive routing protocol is adopted, each peer has to periodically broadcast control messages, which leads to poor efficiency in terms of bandwidth usage.",
                "Either way, constructing an overlay will potentially suffer from the scalability problem.",
                "The paper describes a design paradigm that uses the functional primitives of positive/negative feedback and sporadic random walk to design robust resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs.",
                "In particular, the scheme offers the features of (1) cross-layer design of P2P systems, which allows the routing process at both the P2P and the network layers to be integrated to reduce overhead, (2) scalability and mobility support, which minimizes the use of global flooding operations and adaptively combines proactive resource advertisement and reactive resource discovery, and (3) load balancing, which facilitates resource replication, relocation, and division to achieve load balancing. 8.",
