Previous work in this area usually focuses on single documents, although similar multiple documents are available in many domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method for shared topic detection and topic segmentation of multiple similar documents based on mutual information (MI) and weighted mutual information (WMI) that is a combination of MI and term weights. The basic idea is that the optimal segmentation maximizes MI(or WMI). Our approach can detect shared topics among documents. It can find the optimal boundaries in a document, and align segments among documents at the same time. It also can handle single-document segmentation as a special case of the multi-document segmentation and alignment. Our methods can identify and strengthen cue terms that can be used for segmentation and partially remove stop words by using term weights based on entropy learned from multiple documents. Our experimental results show that our algorithm works well for the tasks of single-document segmentation, shared topic detection, and multi-document segmentation. Utilizing information from multiple documents can tremendously improve the performance of topic segmentation, and using WMI is even better than using MI for the multi-document segmentation.

INTRODUCTION Many researchers have worked on topic detection and tracking (TDT) [26] and topic segmentation during the past decade. Topic segmentation intends to identify the boundaries in a document with the goal to capture the latent topical structure. Topic segmentation tasks usually fall into two categories [15]: text stream segmentation where topic transition is identified, and coherent document segmentation in which documents are split into sub-topics. The former category has applications in automatic speech recognition, while the latter one has more applications such as partial-text query of long documents in information retrieval, text summary, and quality measurement of multiple documents. Previous research in connection with TDT falls into the former category, targeted on topic tracking of broadcast speech data and newswire text, while the latter category has not been studied very well. Traditional approaches perform topic segmentation on documents one at a time [15, 25, 6]. Most of them perform badly in subtle tasks like coherent document segmentation [15]. Often, end-users seek documents that have the similar content. Search engines, like, Google, provide links to obtain similar pages. At a finer granularity, users may actually be looking to obtain sections of a document similar to a particular section that presumably discusses a topic of the users interest. Thus, the extension of topic segmentation from single documents to identifying similar segments from multiple similar documents with the same topic is a natural and necessary direction, and multi-document topic segmentation is expected to have a better performance since more information is utilized. Traditional approaches using similarity measurement based on term frequency generally have the same assumption that similar vocabulary tends to be in a coherent topic segment [15, 25, 6]. However, they usually suffer the issue of identifying stop words. For example, additional document-dependent stop words are removed together with the generic stop words in [15]. There are two reasons that we do not remove stop words directly. First, identifying stop words is another issue [12] that requires estimation in each domain. Removing common stop words may result in the loss of useful information in a specific domain. Second, even though stop words can be identified, hard classification of stop words and nonstop words cannot represent the gradually changing amount of information content of each word. We employ a soft classification using term weights. In this paper, we view the problem of topic segmentation as an optimization issue using information theoretic techniques to find the optimal boundaries of a document given the number of text segments so as to minimize the loss of mutual information (MI) (or a weighted mutual information (WMI)) after segmentation and alignment. This is equal to maximizing the MI (or WMI). The MI focuses on measuring the difference among segments whereas previous research focused on finding the similarity (e.g. cosine distance) of segments [15, 25, 6]. Topic alignment of multiple similar documents can be achieved by clustering sentences on the same topic into the same cluster. Single-document topic segmentation is just a special case of the multi-document topic segmentation and alignment problem. Terms can be co-clustered as in [10] at the same time, given the number of clusters, but our experimental results show that this method results in a worse segmentation (see Tables 1, 4, and 6). Usually, human readers can identify topic transition based on cue words, and can ignore stop words. Inspired by this, we give each term (or term cluster) a weight based on entropy among different documents and different segments of documents. Not only can this approach increase the contribution of cue words, but it can also decrease the effect of common stop words, noisy word, and document-dependent stop words. These words are common in a document. Many methods based on sentence similarity require that these words are removed before topic segmentation can be performed [15]. Our results in Figure 3 show that term weights are useful for multi-document topic segmentation and alignment. The major contribution of this paper is that it introduces a novel method for topic segmentation using MI and shows that this method performs better than previously used criteria. Also, we have addressed the problem of topic segmentation and alignment across multiple documents, whereas most existing research focused on segmentation of single documents. Multi-document segmentation and alignment can utilize information from similar documents and improves the performance of topic segmentation greatly. Obviously, our approach can handle single documents as a special case when multiple documents are unavailable. It can detect shared topics among documents to judge if they are multiple documents on the same topic. We also introduce the new criterion of WMI based on term weights learned from multiple similar documents, which can improve performance of topic segmentation further. We propose an iterative greedy algorithm based on dynamic programming and show that it works well in practice. Some of our prior work is in [24]. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review related work. Section 3 contains a formulation of the problem of topic segmentation and alignment of multiple documents with term co-clustering, a review of the criterion of MI for clustering, and finally an introduction to WMI. In Section 4, we first propose the iterative greedy algorithm of topic segmentation and alignment with term co-clustering, and then describe how the algorithm can be optimized by usFigure 1: Illustration of multi-document segmentation and alignment. ing dynamic programming. In Section 5, experiments about single-document segmentation, shared topic detection, and multi-document segmentation are described, and results are presented and discussed to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. Conclusions and some future directions of the research work are discussed in Section 6. 2. PREVIOUS WORK Generally, the existing approaches to text segmentation fall into two categories: supervised learning [19, 17, 23] and unsupervised learning [3, 27, 5, 6, 15, 25, 21]. Supervised learning usually has good performance, since it learns functions from labelled training sets. However, often getting large training sets with manual labels on document sentences is prohibitively expensive, so unsupervised approaches are desired. Some models consider dependence between sentences and sections, such as Hidden Markov Model [3, 27], Maximum Entropy Markov Model [19], and Conditional Random Fields [17], while many other approaches are based on lexical cohesion or similarity of sentences [5, 6, 15, 25, 21]. Some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11]. While some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others utilize multiple documents [16, 14]. There are not many works in the latter category, even though the performance of segmentation is expected to be better with utilization of information from multiple documents. Previous research studied methods to find shared topics [16] and topic segmentation and summarization between just a pair of documents [14]. Text classification and clustering is a related research area which categorizes documents into groups using supervised or unsupervised methods. Topical classification or clustering is an important direction in this area, especially co-clustering of documents and terms, such as LSA [9], PLSA [13], and approaches based on distances and bipartite graph partitioning [28] or maximum MI [2, 10], or maximum entropy [1, 18]. Criteria of these approaches can be utilized in the issue of topic segmentation. Some of those methods have been extended into the area of topic segmentation, such as PLSA [5] and maximum entropy [7], but to our best knowledge, using MI for topic segmentation has not been studied. 3. PROBLEM FORMULATION Our goal is to segment documents and align the segments across documents (Figure 1). Let T be the set of terms {t1, t2, ..., tl}, which appear in the unlabelled set of documents D = {d1, d2, ..., dm}. Let Sd be the set of sentences for document d ∈ D, i.e.{s1, s2, ..., snd }. We have a 3D matrix of term frequency, in which the three dimensions are random variables of D, Sd, and T. Sd actually is a random vector including a random variable for each d ∈ D. The term frequency can be used to estimate the joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T), which is p(t, d, s) = T(t, d, s)/ND, where T(t, d, s) is the number of t in ds sentence s and ND is the total number of terms in D. ˆS represents the set of segments {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} after segmentation and alignment among multiple documents, where the number of segments | ˆS| = p. A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic. The goal is to find the optimal topic segmentation and alignment mapping Segd(si) : {s1, s2, ..., snd } → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} and Alid(ˆsi) : {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp}, for all d ∈ D, where ˆsi is ith segment with the constraint that only adjacent sentences can be mapped to the same segment, i.e. for d, {si, si+1, ..., sj} → {ˆsq}, where q ∈ {1, ..., p}, where p is the segment number, and if i > j, then for d, ˆsq is missing. After segmentation and alignment, random vector Sd becomes an aligned random variable ˆS. Thus, P(D, Sd, T) becomes P(D, ˆS, T). Term co-clustering is a technique that has been employed [10] to improve the accuracy of document clustering. We evaluate the effect of it for topic segmentation. A term t is mapped to exactly one term cluster. Term co-clustering involves simultaneously finding the optimal term clustering mapping Clu(t) : {t1, t2, ..., tl} → {ˆt1, ˆt2, ..., ˆtk}, where k ≤ l, l is the total number of words in all the documents, and k is the number of clusters. 4. METHODOLOGY We now describe a novel algorithm which can handle singledocument segmentation, shared topic detection, and multidocument segmentation and alignment based on MI or WMI. 4.1 Mutual Information MI I(X; Y ) is a quantity to measure the amount of information which is contained in two or more random variables [8, 10]. For the case of two random variables, we have I(X; Y ) = x∈X y∈Y p(x, y)log p(x, y) p(x)p(y) , (1) Obviously, when random variables X and Y are independent, I(X; Y ) = 0. Thus, intuitively, the value of MI depends on how random variables are dependent on each other. The optimal co-clustering is the mapping Clux : X → ˆX and Cluy : Y → ˆY that minimizes the loss: I(X; Y ) − I( ˆX; ˆY ), which is equal to maximizing I( ˆX; ˆY ). This is the criterion of MI for clustering. In the case of topic segmentation, the two random variables are the term variable T and the segment variable S, and each sample is an occurrence of a term T = t in a particular segment S = s. I(T; S) is used to measure how dependent T and S are. However, I(T; S) cannot be computed for documents before segmentation, since we do not have a set of S due to the fact that sentences of Document d, si ∈ Sd, is not aligned with other documents. Thus, instead of minimizing the loss of MI, we can maximize MI after topic segmentation, computed as: I( ˆT; ˆS) = ˆt∈ ˆT ˆs∈ ˆS p(ˆt, ˆs)log p(ˆt, ˆs) p(ˆt)p(ˆs) , (2) where p(ˆt, ˆs) are estimated by the term frequency tf of Term Cluster ˆt and Segment ˆs in the training set D. Note that here a segment ˆs includes sentences about the the same topic among all documents. The optimal solution is the mapping Clut : T → ˆT, Segd : Sd → ˆS , and Alid : ˆS → ˆS, which maximizes I( ˆT; ˆS). 4.2 Weighted Mutual Information In topic segmentation and alignment of multiple documents, if P(D, ˆS, T) is known, based on the marginal distributions P(D|T) and P( ˆS|T) for each term t ∈ T, we can categorize terms into four types in the data set: • Common stop words are common both along the dimensions of documents and segments. • Document-dependent stop words that depends on the personal writing style are common only along the dimension of segments for some documents. • Cue words are the most important elements for segmentation. They are common along the dimension of documents only for the same segment, and they are not common along the dimensions of segments. • Noisy words are other words which are not common along both dimensions. Entropy based on P(D|T) and P( ˆS|T) can be used to identify different types of terms. To reinforce the contribution of cue words in the MI computation, and simultaneously reduce the effect of the other three types of words, similar as the idea of the tf-idf weight [22], we use entropies of each term along the dimensions of document D and segment ˆS, i.e. ED(ˆt) and EˆS(ˆt), to compute the weight. A cue word usually has a large value of ED(ˆt) but a small value of EˆS(ˆt). We introduce term weights (or term cluster weights) wˆt = ( ED(ˆt) maxˆt ∈ ˆT (ED(ˆt )) )a (1 − EˆS(ˆt) maxˆt ∈ ˆT (EˆS(ˆt )) )b , (3) where ED(ˆt) = d∈D p(d|ˆt)log|D| 1 p(d|ˆt) , EˆS(ˆt) = ˆs∈ ˆS p(ˆs|ˆt)log| ˆS| 1 p(ˆs|ˆt) , and a > 0 and b > 0 are powers to adjust term weights. Usually a = 1 and b = 1 as default, and maxˆt ∈ ˆT (ED(ˆt )) and maxˆt ∈ ˆT (EˆS(ˆt )) are used to normalize the entropy values. Term cluster weights are used to adjust p(ˆt, ˆs), pw(ˆt, ˆs) = wˆtp(ˆt, ˆs) ˆt∈ ˆT ;ˆs∈ ˆS wˆtp(ˆt, ˆs) , (4) and Iw( ˆT; ˆS) = ˆt∈ ˆT ˆs∈ ˆS pw(ˆt, ˆs)log pw(ˆt, ˆs) pw(ˆt)pw(ˆs) , (5) where pw(ˆt) and pw(ˆs) are marginal distributions of pw(ˆt, ˆs). However, since we do not know either the term weights or P(D, ˆS, T), we need to estimate them, but wˆt depends on p(ˆs|t) and ˆS, while ˆS and p(ˆs|t) also depend on wˆt that is still unknown. Thus, an iterative algorithm is required to estimate term weights wˆt and find the best segmentation and alignment to optimize the objective function Iw concurrently. After a document is segmented into sentences Input: Joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T), number of text segments p ∈ {2, 3, ..., max(sd)}, number of term clusters k ∈ {2, 3, ..., l} (if k = l, no term co-clustering required), and weight type w ∈ {0, 1}, indicating to use I or Iw, respectively. Output: Mapping Clu, Seg, Ali, and term weights wˆt. Initialization: 0. i = 0. Initialize Clu (0) t , Seg (0) d , and Ali (0) d ; Initialize w (0) ˆt using Equation (6) if w = 1; Stage 1: 1. If |D| = 1, k = l, and w = 0, check all sequential segmentations of d into p segments and find the best one Segd(s) = argmaxˆsI( ˆT; ˆS), and return Segd; otherwise, if w = 1 and k = l, go to 3.1; Stage 2: 2.1 If k < l, for each term t, find the best cluster ˆt as Clu(i+1)(t) = argmaxˆtI( ˆT; ˆS(i)) based on Seg(i) and Ali(i); 2.2 For each d, check all sequential segmentations of d into p segments with mapping s → ˆs → ˆs, and find the best one Ali (i+1) d (Seg (i+1) d (s)) = argmaxˆsI( ˆT(i+1); ˆS) based on Clu(i+1)(t) if k < l or Clu(0)(t) if k = l; 2.3 i + +. If Clu, Seg, or Ali changed, go to 2.1; otherwise, if w = 0, return Clu(i), Seg(i), and Ali(i); else j = 0, go to 3.1; Stage 3: 3.1 Update w (i+j+1) ˆt based on Seg(i+j), Ali(i+j), and Clu(i) using Equation (3); 3.2 For each d, check all sequential segmentations of d into p segments with mapping s → ˆs → ˆs, and find the best one Ali (i+j+1) d (Seg (i+j+1) d (s)) = argmaxˆsIw( ˆT(i); ˆS) based on Clu(i) and w (i+j+1) ˆt ; 3.3 j + +. If Iw( ˆT; ˆS) changes, go to step 6; otherwise, stop and return Clu(i), Seg(i+j), Ali(i+j), and w (i+j) ˆt ; Figure 2: Algorithm: Topic segmentation and alignment based on MI or WMI. and each sentence is segmented into words, each word is stemmed. Then the joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T) can be estimated. Finally, this distribution can be used to compute MI in our algorithm. 4.3 Iterative Greedy Algorithm Our goal is to maximize the objective function, I( ˆT; ˆS) or Iw( ˆT; ˆS), which can measure the dependence of term occurrences in different segments. Generally, first we do not know the estimate term weights, which depend on the optimal topic segmentation and alignment, and term clusters. Moreover, this problem is NP-hard [10], even though if we know the term weights. Thus, an iterative greedy algorithm is desired to find the best solution, even though probably only local maxima are reached. We present the iterative greedy algorithm in Figure 2 to find a local maximum of I( ˆT; ˆS) or Iw( ˆT; ˆS) with simultaneous term weight estimation. This algorithm can is iterative and greedy for multi-document cases or single-document cases with term weight estimation and/or term co-clustering. Otherwise, since it is just a one step algorithm to solve the task of single-document segmentation [6, 15, 25], the global maximum of MI is guaranteed. We will show later that term co-clustering reduces the accuracy of the results and is not necessary, and for singledocument segmentation, term weights are also not required. 4.3.1 Initialization In Step 0, the initial term clustering Clut and topic segmentation and alignment Segd and Alid are important to avoid local maxima and reduce the number of iterations. First, a good guess of term weights can be made by using the distributions of term frequency along sentences for each document and averaging them to get the initial values of wˆt: wt = ( ED(t) maxt ∈T (ED(t )) )(1 − ES(t) maxt ∈T (ES(t )) ), (6) where ES(t) = 1 |Dt| d∈Dt (1 − s∈Sd p(s|t)log|Sd| 1 p(s|t) ), where Dt is the set of documents which contain Term t. Then, for the initial segmentation Seg(0) , we can simply segment documents equally by sentences. Or we can find the optimal segmentation just for each document d which maximizes the WMI, Seg (0) d = argmaxˆsIw(T; ˆS), where w = w (0) ˆt . For the initial alignment Ali(0) , we can first assume that the order of segments for each d is the same. For the initial term clustering Clu(0) , first cluster labels can be set randomly, and after the first time of Step 3, a good initial term clustering is obtained. 4.3.2 Different Cases After initialization, there are three stages for different cases. Totally there are eight cases, |D| = 1 or |D| > 1, k = l or k < l, w = 0 or w = 1. Single document segmentation without term clustering and term weight estimation (|D| = 1, k = l, w = 0) only requires Stage 1 (Step 1). If term clustering is required (k < l), Stage 2 (Step 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) is executed iteratively. If term weight estimation is required (w = 1), Stage 3 (Step 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3) is executed iteratively. If both are required (k < l, w = 1), Stage 2 and 3 run one after the other. For multi-document segmentation without term clustering and term weight estimation (|D| > 1, k = l, w = 0), only iteration of Step 2.2 and 2.3 are required. At Stage 1, the global maximum can be found based on I( ˆT; ˆS) using dynamic programming in Section 4.4. Simultaneously finding a good term clustering and estimated term weights is impossible, since when moving a term to a new term cluster to maximize Iw( ˆT; ˆS), we do not know that the weight of this term should be the one of the new cluster or the old cluster. Thus, we first do term clustering at Stage 2, and then estimate term weights at Stage 3. At Stage 2, Step 2.1 is to find the best term clustering and Step 2.2 is to find the best segmentation. This cycle is repeated to find a local maximum based on MI I until it converges. The two steps are: (1) based on current term clustering Cluˆt, for each document d, the algorithm segments all the sentences Sd into p segments sequentially (some segments may be empty), and put them into the p segments ˆS of the whole training set D (all possible cases of different segmentation Segd and alignment Alid are checked) to find the optimal case, and (2) based on the current segmentation and alignment, for each term t, the algorithm finds the best term cluster of t based on the current segmentation Segd and alignment Alid. After finding a good term clustering, term weights are estimated if w = 1. At Stage 3, similar as Stage 2, Step 3.1 is term weight re-estimation and Step 3.2 is to find a better segmentation. They are repeated to find a local maximum based on WMI Iw until it converges. However, if the term clustering in Stage 2 is not accurate, then the term weight estimation at Stage 3 may have a bad result. Finally, at Step 3.3, this algorithm converges and return the output. This algorithm can handle both single-document and multi-document segmentation. It also can detect shared topics among documents by checking the proportion of overlapped sentences on the same topics, as described in Sec 5.2. 4.4 Algorithm Optimization In many previous works on segmentation, dynamic programming is a technique used to maximize the objective function. Similarly, at Step 1, 2.2, and 3.2 of our algorithm, we can use dynamic programming. For Stage 1, using dynamic programming can still find the global optimum, but for Stage 2 and Stage 3, we can only find the optimum for each step of topic segmentation and alignment of a document. Here we only show the dynamic programming for Step 3.2 using WMI (Step 1 and 2.2 are similar but they can use either I or Iw). There are two cases that are not shown in the algorithm in Figure 2: (a) single-document segmentation or multi-document segmentation with the same sequential order of segments, where alignment is not required, and (b) multi-document segmentation with different sequential orders of segments, where alignment is necessary. The alignment mapping function of the former case is simply just Alid(ˆsi) = ˆsi, while for the latter ones alignment mapping function Alid(ˆsi) = ˆsj, i and j may be different. The computational steps for the two cases are listed below: Case 1 (no alignment): For each document d: (1) Compute pw(ˆt), partial pw(ˆt, ˆs) and partial pw(ˆs) without counting sentences from d. Then put sentences from i to j into Part k, and compute partial WMI PIw( ˆT; ˆsk(si, si+1, ..., sj)) ˆt∈ ˆT pw(ˆt, ˆsk)log pw(ˆt, ˆsk) pw(ˆt)pw(ˆsk) , where Alid(si, si+1, ..., sj) = k, k ∈ {1, 2, ..., p}, 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ nd, and Segd(sq) = ˆsk for all i ≤ q ≤ j. (2) Let M(sm, 1) = PIw( ˆT; ˆs1(s1, s2, ..., sm)). Then M(sm, L) = maxi[M(si−1, L − 1) + PIw( ˆT; ˆsL(si, ..., sm))], where 0 ≤ m ≤ nd, 1 < L < p, 1 ≤ i ≤ m + 1, and when i > m, no sentences are put into ˆsk when compute PIw (note PIw( ˆT; ˆs(si, ..., sm)) = 0 for single-document segmentation). (3) Finally M(snd , p) = maxi[M(si−1, p − 1)+ PIw( ˆT; ˆsp(si, ..., snd ))], where 1 ≤ i ≤ nd+1. The optimal Iw is found and the corresponding segmentation is the best. Case 2 (alignment required): For each document d: (1) Compute pw(ˆt), partial pw(ˆt, ˆs), and partial pw(ˆs), and PIw( ˆT; ˆsk(si, si+1, ..., sj)) similarly as Case 1. (2) Let M(sm, 1, k) = PIw( ˆT; ˆsk(s1, s2, ..., sm)), where k ∈ {1, 2, ..., p}. Then M(sm, L, kL) = maxi,j[M(si−1, L − 1, kL/j) + PIw( ˆT; ˆsAlid(ˆsL )=j(si, si+1, ..., sm))], where 0 ≤ m ≤ nd, 1 < L < p, 1 ≤ i ≤ m + 1, kL ∈ Set(p, L), which is the set of all p! L!(p−L)! combinations of L segments chosen from all p segments, j ∈ kL, the set of L segments chosen from all p segments, and kL/j is the combination of L − 1 segments in kL except Segment j. (3) Finally, M(snd , p, kp) = maxi,j[M(si−1, p − 1, kp/j) +PIw( ˆT; ˆsAlid(ˆsL )=j(si, si+1, ..., snd ))], where kp is just the combination of all p segments and 1 ≤ i ≤ nd + 1, which is the optimal Iw and the corresponding segmentation is the best. The steps of Case 1 and 2 are similar, except in Case 2, alignment is considered in addition to segmentation. First, basic items of probability for computing Iw are computed excluding Doc d, and then partial WMI by putting every possible sequential segment (including empty segment) of d into every segment of the set. Second, the optimal sum of PIw for L segments and the leftmost m sentences, M(sm, L), is found. Finally, the maximal WMI is found among different sums of M(sm, p − 1) and PIw for Segment p. 5. EXPERIMENTS In this section, single-document segmentation, shared topic detection, and multi-document segmentation will be tested. Different hyper parameters of our method are studied. For convenience, we refer to the method using I as MIk if w = 0, and Iw as WMIk if w = 2 or as WMIk if w = 1, where k is the number of term clusters, and if k = l, where l is the total number of terms, then no term clustering is required, i.e. MIl and WMIl. 5.1 Single-document Segmentation 5.1.1 Test Data and Evaluation The first data set we tested is a synthetic one used in previous research [6, 15, 25] and many other papers. It has 700 samples. Each is a concatenation of ten segments. Each segment is the first n sentence selected randomly from the Brown corpus, which is supposed to have a different topic from each other. Currently, the best results on this data set is achieved by Ji et.al. [15]. To compare the performance of our methods, the criterion used widely in previous research is applied, instead of the unbiased criterion introduced in [20]. It chooses a pair of words randomly. If they are in different segments (different) for the real segmentation (real), but predicted (pred) as in the same segment, it is a miss. If they are in the same segment (same), but predicted as in different segments, it is a false alarm. Thus, the error rate is computed using the following equation: p(err|real, pred) = p(miss|real, pred, diff)p(diff|real) +p(false alarm|real, pred, same)p(same|real). 5.1.2 Experiment Results We tested the case when the number of segments is known. Table 1 shows the results of our methods with different hyper parameter values and three previous approaches, C99[25], U00[6], and ADDP03[15], on this data set when the segment number is known. In WMI for single-document segmentation, the term weights are computed as follows: wˆt = 1−EˆS(ˆt)/maxˆt ∈ ˆT (EˆS(ˆt )). For this case, our methods MIl and WMIl both outperform all the previous approaches. We compared our methods with ADDP03using one-sample one-sided t-test and p-values are shown in Table 2. From the p-values, we can see that mostly the differences are very Table 1: Average Error Rates of Single-document Segmentation Given Segment Numbers Known Range of n 3-11 3-5 6-8 9-11 Sample size 400 100 100 100 C99 12% 11% 10% 9% U00 10% 9% 7% 5% ADDP03 6.0% 6.8% 5.2% 4.3% MIl 4.68% 5.57% 2.59% 1.59% WMIl 4.94% 6.33% 2.76% 1.62% MI100 9.62% 12.92% 8.66% 6.67% Table 2: Single-document Segmentation: P-values of T-test on Error Rates Range of n 3-11 3-5 6-8 9-11 ADDP03, MIl 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 ADDP03, WMIl 0.000 0.099 0.000 0.000 MIl, WMIl 0.061 0.132 0.526 0.898 significant. We also compare the error rates between our two methods using two-sample two-sided t-test to check the hypothesis that they are equal. We cannot reject the hypothesis that they are equal, so the difference are not significant, even though all the error rates for MIl are smaller than WMIl. However, we can conclude that term weights contribute little in single-document segmentation. The results also show that MI using term co-clustering (k = 100) decreases the performance. We tested different number of term clusters, and found that the performance becomes better when the cluster number increases to reach l. WMIk<l has similar results that we did not show in the table. As mentioned before, using MI may be inconsistent on optimal boundaries given different numbers of segments. This situation occurs especially when the similarities among segments are quite different, i.e. some transitions are very obvious, while others are not. This is because usually a document is a hierarchical structure instead of only a sequential structure. When the segments are not at the same level, this situation may occur. Thus, a hierarchical topic segmentation approach is desired, and the structure highly depends on the number of segments for each internal node and the stop criteria of splitting. For this data set of singledocument segmentation, since it is just a synthetic set, which is just a concatenation of several segments about different topics, it is reasonable that approaches simply based on term frequency have a good performance. Usually for the tasks of segmenting coherent documents for sub-topics, the effectiveness decreases much. 5.2 Shared Topic Detection 5.2.1 Test Data and Evaluation The second data set contains 80 news articles from Google News. There are eight topics and each has 10 articles. We randomly split the set into subsets with different document numbers and each subset has all eight topics. We compare our approach MIl and WMIl with LDA [4]. LDA treats a document in the data set as a bag of words, finds its distribution on topics, and its major topic. MIl and WMIl views each sentence as a bag of words and tag it with a topic label. Then for each pair of documents, LDA determines if they are on the same topic, while MIl and Table 3: Shared Topic Detection: Average Error Rates for Different Numbers of Documents in Each Subset #Doc 10 20 40 80 LDA 8.89% 16.33% 1.35% 0.60% MIl, θ = 0.6 4.17% 1.71% 1.47% 0.0% WMIl, θ = 0.8 18.6% 3.16% 1.92% 0.0% WMIl check whether the proportion overlapped sentences on the same topic is larger than the adjustable threshold θ. That is, in MIl and WMIl, for a pair of documents d, d , if [ s∈Sd,s ∈Sd 1(topics=topics )/min(|Sd|, |Sd|)] > θ, where Sd is the set of sentences of d, and |Sd| is the number of sentences of d, then d and d have the shared topic. For a pair of documents selected randomly, the error rate is computed using the following equation: p(err|real, pred) = p(miss|real, pred, same)p(same|real) +p(false alarm|real, pred, diff)p(diff|real), where a miss means if they have the same topic (same) for the real case (real), but predicted (pred) as on the same topic. If they are on different topics (diff), but predicted as on the same topic, it is a false alarm. 5.2.2 Experiment Results The results are shown in Table 3. If most documents have different topics, in WMIl, the estimation of term weights in Equation (3) is not correct. Thus, WMIl is not expected to have a better performance than MIl, when most documents have different topics. When there are fewer documents in a subset with the same number of topics, more documents have different topics, so WMIl is more worse than MIl. We can see that for most cases MIl has a better (or at least similar) performance than LDA. After shared topic detection, multi-document segmentation of documents with the shared topics is able to be executed. 5.3 Multi-document Segmentation 5.3.1 Test Data and Evaluation For multi-document segmentation and alignment, our goal is to identify these segments about the same topic among multiple similar documents with shared topics. Using Iw is expected to perform better than I, since without term weights the result is affected seriously by document-dependent stop words and noisy words which depends on the personal writing style. It is more likely to treat the same segments of different documents as different segments under the effect of document-dependent stop words and noisy words. Term weights can reduce the effect of document-dependent stop words and noisy words by giving cue terms more weights. The data set for multi-document segmentation and alignment has 102 samples and 2264 sentences totally. Each is the introduction part of a lab report selected from the course of Biol 240W, Pennsylvania State University. Each sample has two segments, introduction of plant hormones and the content in the lab. The length range of samples is from two to 56 sentences. Some samples only have one part and some have a reverse order the these two segments. It is not hard to identify the boundary between two segments for human. We labelled each sentence manually for evaluation. The criterion of evaluation is just using the proportion of the number of sentences with wrong predicted segment labels in the total number of sentences in the whole training Table 4: Average Error Rates of Multi-document Segmentation Given Segment Numbers Known #Doc MIl WMIl k MIk WMIk 102 3.14% 2.78% 300 4.68% 6.58% 51 4.17% 3.63% 300 17.83% 22.84% 34 5.06% 4.12% 300 18.75% 20.95% 20 7.08% 5.42% 250 20.40% 21.83% 10 10.38% 7.89% 250 21.42% 21.91% 5 15.77% 11.64% 250 21.89% 22.59% 2 25.90% 23.18% 50 25.44% 25.49% 1 23.90% 24.82% 25 25.75% 26.15% Table 5: Multi-document Segmentation: P-values of T-test on Error Rates for MIl and WMIl #Doc 51 34 20 10 5 2 P-value 0.19 0.101 0.025 0.001 0.000 0.002 set as the error rate: p(error|predicted, real) = d∈D s∈Sd 1(predicteds=reals)/ d∈D nd. In order to show the benefits of multi-document segmentation and alignment, we compared our method with different parameters on different partitions of the same training set. Except the cases that the number of documents is 102 and one (they are special cases of using the whole set and the pure single-document segmentation), we randomly divided the training set into m partitions, and each has 51, 34, 20, 10, 5, and 2 document samples. Then we applied our methods on each partition and calculated the error rate of the whole training set. Each case was repeated for 10 times for computing the average error rates. For different partitions of the training set, different k values are used, since the number of terms increases when the document number in each partition increases. 5.3.2 Experiment Results From the experiment results in Table 4, we can see the following observations: (1) When the number of documents increases, all methods have better performances. Only from one to two documents, MIl has decrease a little. We can observe this from Figure 3 at the point of document number = 2. Most curves even have the worst results at this point. There are two reasons. First, because samples vote for the best multi-document segmentation and alignment, but if only two documents are compared with each other, the one with missing segments or a totally different sequence will affect the correct segmentation and alignment of the other. Second, as noted at the beginning of this section, if two documents have more document-dependent stop words or noisy words than cue words, then the algorithm may view them as two different segments and the other segment is missing. Generally, we can only expect a better performance when the number of documents is larger than the number of segments. (2) Except single-document segmentation, WMIl is always better than MIl, and when the number of documents is reaching one or increases to a very large number, their performances become closer. Table 5 shows p-values of twosample one-sided t-test between MIl and WMIl. We also can see this trend from p-values. When document number = 5, we reached the smallest p-value and the largest difference between error rates of MIl and WMIl. For single-document Table 6: Multi-document Segmentation: Average Error Rate for Document Number = 5 in Each Subset with Different Number of Term Clusters #Cluster 75 100 150 250 l MIk 24.67% 24.54% 23.91% 22.59% 15.77% segmentation, WMIl is even a little bit worse than MIl, which is similar as the results of the single-document segmentation on the first data set. The reason is that for singledocument segmentation, we cannot estimate term weights accurately, since multiple documents are unavailable. (3) Using term clustering usually gets worse results than MIl and WMIl.(4) Using term clustering in WMIk is even worse than in MIk, since in WMIk term clusters are found first using I before using Iw. If the term clusters are not correct, then the term weights are estimated worse, which may mislead the algorithm to reach even worse results. From the results we also found that in multi-document segmentation and alignment, most documents with missing segments and a reverse order are identified correctly. Table 6 illustrates the experiment results for the case of 20 partitions (each has five document samples) of the training set and topic segmentation and alignment using MIk with different numbers of term clusters k. Notice that when the number of term clusters increases, the error rate becomes smaller. Without term clustering, we have the best result. We did not show results for WMIk with term clustering, but the results are similar. We also tested WMIl with different hyper parameters of a and b to adjust term weights. The results are presented in Figure 3. It was shown that the default case WMIl : a = 1, b = 1 gave the best results for different partitions of the training set. We can see the trend that when the document number is very small or large, the difference between MIl : a = 0, b = 0 and WMIl : a = 1, b = 1 becomes quite small. When the document number is not large (about from 2 to 10), all the cases using term weights have better performances than MIl : a = 0, b = 0 without term weights, but when the document number becomes larger, the cases WMIl : a = 1, b = 0 and WMIl : a = 2, b = 1 become worse than MIl : a = 0, b = 0. When the document number becomes very large, they are even worse than cases with small document numbers. This means that a proper way to estimate term weights for the criterion of WMI is very important. Figure 4 shows the term weights learned from the whole training set. Four types of words are categorized roughly even though the transition among them are subtle. Figure 5 illustrates the change in (weighted) mutual information for MIl and WMIl. As expected, mutual information for MIl increases monotonically with the number of steps, while WMIl does not. Finally, MIl and WMIl are scalable, with computational complexity shown in Figure 6. One advantage for our approach based on MI is that removing stop words is not required. Another important advantage is that there are no necessary hyper parameters to adjust. In single-document segmentation, the performance based on MI is even better for that based on WMI, so no extra hyper parameter is required. In multi-document segmentation, we show in the experiment, a = 1 and b = 1 is the best. Our method gives more weights to cue terms. However, usually cue terms or sentences appear at the beginning of a segment, while the end of the segment may be 1 2 5 10 20 34 51 102 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 Document Number ErrorRate MIl :a=0,b=0 WMI l :a=1,b=1 WMI l :a=1,b=0 WMI l :a=2,b=1 Figure 3: Error rates for different hyper parameters of term weights. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Normalized Document Entropy NormalizedSegmentEntropy Noisy words Cue words Common stop words Doc−dep stop words Figure 4: Term weights learned from the whole training set. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 Number of Steps (Weighted)MutualInformation MI l WMI l Figure 5: Change in (weighted) MI for MIl and WMIl. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 Document Number TimetoConverge(sec) MI l WMI l Figure 6: Time to converge for MIl and WMIl. much noisy. One possible solution is giving more weights to terms at the beginning of each segment. Moreover, when the length of segments are quite different, long segments have much higher term frequencies, so they may dominate the segmentation boundaries. Normalization of term frequencies versus the segment length may be useful. 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We proposed a novel method for multi-document topic segmentation and alignment based on weighted mutual information, which can also handle single-document cases. We used dynamic programming to optimize our algorithm. Our approach outperforms all the previous methods on singledocument cases. Moreover, we also showed that doing segmentation among multiple documents can improve the performance tremendously. Our results also illustrated that using weighted mutual information can utilize the information of multiple documents to reach a better performance. We only tested our method on limited data sets. More data sets especially complicated ones should be tested. More previous methods should be compared with. Moreover, natural segmentations like paragraphs are hints that can be used to find the optimal boundaries. Supervised learning also can be considered. 7.

Introducción Muchos investigadores han trabajado en detección y seguimiento de temas (TDT) [26] y segmentación de temas durante la última década. La segmentación del tema tiene la intención de identificar los límites en un documento con el objetivo de capturar la estructura tópica latente. Las tareas de segmentación de temas generalmente se dividen en dos categorías [15]: segmentación de flujo de texto donde se identifica la transición del tema y la segmentación coherente de documentos en la que los documentos se dividen en subtópicos. La primera categoría tiene aplicaciones en el reconocimiento automático de voz, mientras que la segunda tiene más aplicaciones, como consulta de texto parcial de documentos largos en recuperación de información, resumen de texto y medición de calidad de múltiples documentos. Investigaciones previas en relación con TDT se encuentran en la primera categoría, dirigida al seguimiento de temas de datos de discurso de transmisión y texto de Newswire, mientras que la última categoría no se ha estudiado muy bien. Los enfoques tradicionales realizan la segmentación de temas en los documentos uno a la vez [15, 25, 6]. La mayoría de ellos se desempeñan mal en tareas sutiles como la segmentación de documentos coherentes [15]. A menudo, los usuarios finales buscan documentos que tengan contenido similar. Los motores de búsqueda, como, Google, proporcionan enlaces para obtener páginas similares. Con una granularidad más fina, los usuarios pueden estar buscando obtener secciones de un documento similar a una sección particular que presumiblemente discute un tema del interés de los usuarios. Por lo tanto, la extensión de la segmentación de temas de documentos individuales a identificar segmentos similares de múltiples documentos similares con el mismo tema es una dirección natural y necesaria, y se espera que la segmentación de temas de documentos múltiples tenga un mejor rendimiento ya que se utiliza más información. Los enfoques tradicionales que utilizan la medición de similitud basada en la frecuencia del término generalmente tienen la misma suposición de que el vocabulario similar tiende a estar en un segmento de temas coherente [15, 25, 6]. Sin embargo, generalmente sufren el problema de identificar las palabras de detención. Por ejemplo, las palabras de parada dependientes de documentos adicionales se eliminan junto con las palabras de parada genérica en [15]. Hay dos razones por las que no eliminamos las palabras de detención directamente. Primero, la identificación de palabras de parada es otro problema [12] que requiere estimación en cada dominio. La eliminación de palabras de parada comunes puede dar lugar a la pérdida de información útil en un dominio específico. En segundo lugar, a pesar de que se pueden identificar palabras de parada, la clasificación dura de las palabras de parada y las palabras sin parar no puede representar la cantidad cambiante de contenido de información de cada palabra. Empleamos una clasificación suave utilizando pesos de términos. En este documento, vemos el problema de la segmentación de temas como un problema de optimización utilizando técnicas teóricas de información para encontrar los límites óptimos de un documento dado el número de segmentos de texto para minimizar la pérdida de información mutua (MI) (o una mutua ponderadaInformación (WMI)) después de la segmentación y alineación. Esto es igual a maximizar el MI (o WMI). El MI se centra en medir la diferencia entre los segmentos, mientras que las investigaciones previas se centraron en encontrar la similitud (por ejemplo, la distancia coseno) de los segmentos [15, 25, 6]. La alineación del tema de múltiples documentos similares se puede lograr agrupando oraciones sobre el mismo tema en el mismo clúster. La segmentación de temas de un solo documento es solo un caso especial del problema de segmentación y alineación de temas multi-documentos. Los términos se pueden agrupar como en [10] al mismo tiempo, dado el número de grupos, pero nuestros resultados experimentales muestran que este método da como resultado una peor segmentación (ver Tablas 1, 4 y 6). Por lo general, los lectores humanos pueden identificar la transición del tema basada en palabras de referencia y pueden ignorar las palabras de detención. Inspirados por esto, le damos a cada término (o clúster de término) un peso basado en la entropía entre diferentes documentos y diferentes segmentos de documentos. Este enfoque no solo puede aumentar la contribución de las palabras de referencia, sino que también puede disminuir el efecto de las palabras de parada comunes, la palabra ruidosa y las palabras de parada dependientes del documento. Estas palabras son comunes en un documento. Muchos métodos basados en la similitud de oraciones requieren que estas palabras se eliminen antes de que se pueda realizar la segmentación del tema [15]. Nuestros resultados en la Figura 3 muestran que los pesos de término son útiles para la segmentación y alineación de temas de documentos múltiples. La principal contribución de este documento es que introduce un método novedoso para la segmentación de temas utilizando MI y muestra que este método funciona mejor que los criterios previamente utilizados. Además, hemos abordado el problema de la segmentación y la alineación de los temas en múltiples documentos, mientras que la mayoría de la investigación existente se centró en la segmentación de documentos individuales. La segmentación y la alineación de múltiples documentos pueden utilizar información de documentos similares y mejorar en gran medida el rendimiento de la segmentación de temas. Obviamente, nuestro enfoque puede manejar documentos individuales como un caso especial cuando múltiples documentos no están disponibles. Puede detectar temas compartidos entre documentos para juzgar si son múltiples documentos sobre el mismo tema. También presentamos el nuevo criterio de WMI basado en los pesos de términos aprendidos de múltiples documentos similares, lo que puede mejorar aún más el rendimiento de la segmentación de temas. Proponemos un algoritmo codicioso iterativo basado en la programación dinámica y mostramos que funciona bien en la práctica. Parte de nuestro trabajo anterior está en [24]. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la Sección 2, revisamos el trabajo relacionado. La Sección 3 contiene una formulación del problema de la segmentación de temas y la alineación de múltiples documentos con la agrupación de términos, una revisión del criterio de MI para la agrupación, y finalmente una introducción a WMI. En la Sección 4, primero proponemos el algoritmo codicioso iterativo de la segmentación y la alineación de los temas con la agrupación de plazo, y luego describimos cómo el algoritmo puede optimizarse mediante USFIGURE 1: Ilustración de la segmentación y alineación de documentos múltiples.ing programación dinámica. En la Sección 5, se describen experimentos sobre la segmentación de un solo documento, la detección de temas compartidos y la segmentación de múltiples documentos, y se presentan y discuten los resultados para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro algoritmo. Las conclusiones y algunas direcciones futuras del trabajo de investigación se discuten en la Sección 6. 2. Trabajo previo en general, los enfoques existentes para la segmentación de texto se dividen en dos categorías: aprendizaje supervisado [19, 17, 23] y aprendizaje no supervisado [3, 27, 5, 6, 15, 25, 21]. El aprendizaje supervisado generalmente tiene un buen rendimiento, ya que aprende funciones de conjuntos de capacitación etiquetados. Sin embargo, a menudo obtener grandes conjuntos de capacitación con etiquetas manuales en oraciones de documentos es prohibitivamente costoso, por lo que se desean enfoques no supervisados. Algunos modelos consideran la dependencia entre oraciones y secciones, como el modelo oculto de Markov [3, 27], el modelo de Markov máximo de entropía [19] y los campos aleatorios condicionales [17], mientras que muchos otros enfoques se basan en la cohesión léxica o la similitud de las oraciones [[5, 6, 15, 25, 21]. Algunos enfoques también se centran en las palabras de referencia como indicios de transiciones de temas [11]. Mientras que algunos métodos existentes solo consideran la información en documentos individuales [6, 15], otros utilizan múltiples documentos [16, 14]. No hay muchos trabajos en la última categoría, a pesar de que se espera que el rendimiento de la segmentación sea mejor con la utilización de información de múltiples documentos. Investigaciones anteriores estudiaron métodos para encontrar temas compartidos [16] y segmentación de temas y resumen entre solo un par de documentos [14]. La clasificación de texto y la agrupación es un área de investigación relacionada que clasifica los documentos en grupos que utilizan métodos supervisados o no supervisados. La clasificación o agrupación tópica es una dirección importante en esta área, especialmente la agrupación conjunta de documentos y términos, como LSA [9], PLSA [13] y enfoques basados en distancias y partición gráfica bipartita [28] o MI máximo [2 [2, 10], o entropía máxima [1, 18]. Los criterios de estos enfoques se pueden utilizar en el tema de la segmentación de temas. Algunos de esos métodos se han extendido al área de la segmentación de temas, como PLSA [5] y la máxima entropía [7], pero para nuestro mejor conocimiento, no se ha estudiado el uso de MI para la segmentación de temas.3. Formulación del problema Nuestro objetivo es segmentar documentos y alinear los segmentos entre los documentos (Figura 1). Sea t el conjunto de términos {t1, t2, ..., tl}, que aparecen en el conjunto no etiquetado de documentos d = {d1, d2, ..., dm}. Sea SD el conjunto de oraciones para el documento d ∈ D, es decir, {S1, S2, ..., Snd}. Tenemos una matriz 3D de frecuencia de término, en la que las tres dimensiones son variables aleatorias de D, SD y T. SD en realidad es un vector aleatorio que incluye una variable aleatoria para cada d ∈ D. La frecuencia del término se puede usar para estimar elDistribución de probabilidad conjunta P (D, SD, T), que es P (T, D, S) = T (T, D, S)/Nd, donde T (T, D, S) es el número de T en DSLa oración S y ND es el número total de términos en D. ˆs representa el conjunto de segmentos {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆSp} Después de la segmentación y alineación entre múltiples documentos, donde el número de segmentos |ˆS |= p.Un segmento ˆSi del documento D es una secuencia de oraciones adyacentes en d.Dado que para diferentes documentos, SI puede discutir diferentes subtópicos, nuestro objetivo es agrupar oraciones adyacentes en cada documento en segmentos y alinear segmentos similares entre documentos, de modo que para diferentes documentos ˆSi es aproximadamente el mismo subtema. El objetivo es encontrar la segmentación de temas óptima y la asignación de alineación Segd (Si): {S1, S2, ..., SND} → {ˆS1, ˆS2, ..., ˆSp} y Alid (ˆSi): {ˆs1, ˆs22, ..., ˆSP} → {ˆS1, ˆS2, ..., ˆSP}, para todos d ∈ D, donde ˆSi es un segmento con la restricción de que solo las oraciones adyacentes se pueden asignar al mismo segmento, es decir, para d,{Si, Si+1, ..., Sj} → {ˆSQ}, donde q ∈ {1, ..., p}, donde p es el número de segmento, y si i> j, entonces para d, ˆSQ esdesaparecido. Después de la segmentación y la alineación, el vector aleatorio SD se convierte en una variable aleatoria alineada ˆS. Así, P (D, Sd, T) se convierte en P (D, ˆs, T). La co-clúster de términos es una técnica que se ha empleado [10] para mejorar la precisión de la agrupación de documentos. Evaluamos el efecto del mismo para la segmentación de temas. Un término t se asigna a exactamente un clúster de término. El término co-agrupado implica encontrar simultáneamente el mapeo de agrupación de término óptimo clu (t): {t1, t2, ..., tl} → {ˆt1, ˆt2, ..., ˆtk}, donde k ≤ l, l es el totalNúmero de palabras en todos los documentos, y k es el número de grupos.4. Metodología ahora describimos un algoritmo novedoso que puede manejar la segmentación de SingledOcument, la detección de temas compartidos y la segmentación y alineación multidocumento basadas en MI o WMI.4.1 Información mutua Mi I (x; y) es una cantidad para medir la cantidad de información que está contenida en dos o más variables aleatorias [8, 10]. Para el caso de dos variables aleatorias, tenemos i (x; y) = x∈X y∈Y p (x, y) log p (x, y) p (x) p (y), (1) obviamente,Cuando las variables aleatorias x e y son independientes, i (x; y) = 0. Por lo tanto, intuitivamente, el valor de MI depende de cómo las variables aleatorias dependan entre sí. La co-agrupación óptima es el mapeo clux: x → ˆx y cluy: y → ˆy que minimiza la pérdida: i (x; y)-i (ˆx; ˆy), que es igual a maximizar i (ˆx; ˆy). Este es el criterio de MI para la agrupación. En el caso de la segmentación del tema, las dos variables aleatorias son la variable de término t y la variable de segmento S, y cada muestra es una aparición de un término t = t en un segmento particular s = s.I (T; s) se usa para medir cuán dependientes son los T y S. Sin embargo, yo (t; s) no se puede calcular para documentos antes de la segmentación, ya que no tenemos un conjunto de S debido al hecho de que las oraciones del documento d, si ∈ Sd no están alineadas con otros documentos. Por lo tanto, en lugar de minimizar la pérdida de MI, podemos maximizar el MI después de la segmentación de temas, calculado como: i (ˆt; ˆs) = ˆt∈ ˆt ˆs∈ ˆs p (ˆt, ˆs) log p (ˆt, ˆs) p (ˆt) p (ˆs), (2) donde p (ˆt, ˆs) se estima por el término frecuencia tf del clúster de término ˆt y segmento ˆs en el conjunto de entrenamiento D. Tenga en cuenta que aquí un segmento ˆS incluye oraciones sobre el mismo tema entretodos los documentos. La solución óptima es el mapeo Clut: T → ˆt, Segd: SD → ˆs y Alid: ˆs → ˆs, que maximiza i (ˆt; ˆs).4.2 Información mutua ponderada en la segmentación y alineación de temas de múltiples documentos, si se conoce p (d, ˆs, t), en función de las distribuciones marginales P (d | t) y p (ˆs | t) para cada término t ∈ T,Podemos clasificar los términos en cuatro tipos en el conjunto de datos: • Las palabras de parada comunes son comunes tanto a lo largo de las dimensiones de documentos y segmentos.• Las palabras de detención dependientes del documento que depende del estilo de escritura personal son comunes solo a lo largo de la dimensión de segmentos para algunos documentos.• Las palabras de referencia son los elementos más importantes para la segmentación. Son comunes a lo largo de la dimensión de los documentos solo para el mismo segmento, y no son comunes a lo largo de las dimensiones de los segmentos.• Las palabras ruidosas son otras palabras que no son comunes a lo largo de ambas dimensiones. La entropía basada en P (D | T) y P (ˆs | T) se puede usar para identificar diferentes tipos de términos. Para reforzar la contribución de las palabras de referencia en el cálculo de MI, y reducir simultáneamente el efecto de los otros tres tipos de palabras, similar a la idea del peso TF-IDF [22], usamos entropías de cada término a lo largo de las dimensiones del documentoD y segmento ˆs, es decir Ed (ˆt) y eˆs (ˆt), para calcular el peso. Una palabra de referencia generalmente tiene un gran valor de ed (ˆt) pero un pequeño valor de eˆs (ˆt). Introducimos pesos de términos (o pesos de clúster de términos) wˆt = (ed (ˆt) maxˆt ∈ ˆt (ed (ˆt))) A (1 - eˆs (ˆt) maxˆt ∈ ˆt (eˆs (ˆt))) b, (3)donde ed (ˆt) = d∈D p (d | ˆt) log | d |1 p (d | ˆt), eˆs (ˆt) = ˆs∈ ˆs p (ˆs | ˆt) log |ˆS |1 p (ˆs | ˆt), y a> 0 y b> 0 son poderes para ajustar los pesos de los términos. Por lo general, a = 1 y b = 1 como predeterminado, y maxˆt ∈ ˆt (ed (ˆt)) y maxˆt ∈ ˆt (eˆs (ˆt)) se usan para normalizar los valores de entropía. Los pesos del clúster del término se utilizan para ajustar p (ˆt, ˆs), pw (ˆt, ˆs) = wˆtp (ˆt, ˆs) ˆt∈ ˆt; ˆs∈ ˆs wˆtp (ˆt, ˆs), (4) e iw (ˆt; ˆs;) = ˆT∈ ˆT ˆS∈ ˆS pw (ˆt, ˆs) log pw (ˆt, ˆs) pw (ˆt) pw (ˆ), (5) donde pw (ˆt) y pw (ˆs) son distribuciones marginales de pw (ˆt, s). Sin embargo, dado que no conocemos el término pesos ni p (d, ˆs, t), necesitamos estimarlos, pero wˆt depende de p (ˆs | t) y ˆs, mientras que ˆs y p (ˆs | t) tambiénDepende de Wˆt que aún se desconoce. Por lo tanto, se requiere un algoritmo iterativo para estimar los pesos de los términos wˆt y encontrar la mejor segmentación y alineación para optimizar la función objetivo IW simultáneamente. Después de que un documento se segmenta en la entrada de oraciones: distribución de probabilidad conjunta P (D, SD, T), número de segmentos de texto p ∈ {2, 3, ..., max (SD)}, número de grupos de término k ∈ {2, 3, ..., l} (si k = l, no se requiere un término co-clúster), y tipo de peso w ∈ {0, 1}, lo que indica usar i o iw, respectivamente. Salida: Mapeo de los pesos CLU, SEG, ALI y Término Wˆt. Inicialización: 0. i = 0. Inicializar Clu (0) T, Seg (0) D, y Ali (0) D;Inicializar w (0) ˆt usando la ecuación (6) si w = 1;Etapa 1: 1. Si | D |= 1, k = l, y w = 0, verifique todas las segmentos secuenciales de D en segmentos P y encuentre el mejor segd (s) = argmaxˆsi (ˆt; ˆs) y return segd;de lo contrario, si w = 1 y k = l, vaya a 3.1;Etapa 2: 2.1 Si k <l, para cada término t, encuentre el mejor grupo ˆt como clu (i+1) (t) = argmaxˆti (ˆt; ˆs (i)) basado en seg (i) y ali (i);2.2 Para cada d, verifique todas las segmentaciones secuenciales de D en segmentos P con mapeo S → ˆs → ˆs, y encuentre el mejor Ali (i+1) d (Seg (i+1) d (s)) = argmaxˆsi (ˆT(i+1); ˆs) basado en CLU (i+1) (t) si k <l o clu (0) (t) si k = l;2.3 I + +. Si Clu, Seg o Ali cambian, vaya a 2.1;de lo contrario, si w = 0, return clu (i), seg (i) y ali (i);más j = 0, vaya a 3.1;Etapa 3: 3.1 Actualización W (i+j+1) ˆt basada en Seg (i+j), ali (i+j) y clu (i) usando la ecuación (3);3.2 Para cada D, verifique todas las segmentaciones secuenciales de D en segmentos P con mapeo S → ˆs → ˆs, y encuentre el mejor Ali (i+j+1) d (Seg (i+j+1) d (s))= argmaxˆsiw (ˆt (i); ˆs) basado en Clu (i) y w (i+j+1) ˆt;3.3 J + +. Si cambia iw (ˆt; ˆs), vaya al paso 6;De lo contrario, detén y devuelva Clu (i), Seg (i+j), Ali (i+j) y w (i+j) ˆt;Figura 2: Algoritmo: segmentación de temas y alineación basadas en MI o WMI.y cada oración se segmenta en palabras, cada palabra se mueve. Luego se puede estimar la distribución de probabilidad conjunta P (D, SD, T). Finalmente, esta distribución se puede usar para calcular el MI en nuestro algoritmo.4.3 Algoritmo codicioso iterativo Nuestro objetivo es maximizar la función objetivo, I (ˆt; ˆs) o IW (ˆT; ˆs), que puede medir la dependencia de los acontecimientos de términos en diferentes segmentos. En general, primero no conocemos los pesos del término estimado, que dependen de la segmentación y alineación de temas óptimos, y los grupos de término. Además, este problema es NP-Hard [10], aunque si conocemos el término pesos. Por lo tanto, se desea un algoritmo codicioso iterativo para encontrar la mejor solución, aunque probablemente solo se alcance los máximos locales. Presentamos el algoritmo codicioso iterativo en la Figura 2 para encontrar un máximo local de i (ˆt; ˆs) o iw (ˆt; ˆs) con una estimación de peso de término simultáneo. Este algoritmo es iterativo y codicioso para casos de documentos múltiples o casos de un solo documento con estimación de peso a término y/o clúster de plazo. De lo contrario, dado que es solo un algoritmo de un paso para resolver la tarea de segmentación de un solo documento [6, 15, 25], se garantiza el máximo global de MI. Más adelante mostraremos que el término co-agrupación reduce la precisión de los resultados y no es necesario, y para la segmentación de colocación de solteros, tampoco se requiere pesos de término.4.3.1 Inicialización En el paso 0, el término inicial agrupa y la segmentación de temas segmentan y alineación SEGD y ALID son importantes para evitar los máximos locales y reducir el número de iteraciones. Primero, se puede hacer una buena suposición de los pesos de términos utilizando las distribuciones de frecuencia de término a lo largo de las oraciones para cada documento y promediarlas para obtener los valores iniciales de wˆt: wt = (ed (t) maxt ∈T (ed (t))) (1 - es (t) maxt ∈T (es (t))), (6) donde es (t) = 1 | dt |d∈Dt (1 - s∈Sd p (s | t) log | sd | 1 p (s | t)), donde dt es el conjunto de documentos que contienen el término t.Luego, para la segmentación inicial SEG (0), simplemente podemos segmentar documentos igualmente por oraciones. O podemos encontrar la segmentación óptima solo para cada documento D que maximiza el WMI, Seg (0) d = argmaxˆsiw (t; ˆs), donde w = w (0) ˆt. Para la alineación inicial Ali (0), primero podemos suponer que el orden de los segmentos para cada D es el mismo. Para el término inicial de agrupación CLU (0), las etiquetas del primer clúster se pueden establecer al azar, y después de la primera vez del paso 3, se obtiene una buena agrupación de término inicial.4.3.2 Casos diferentes después de la inicialización, hay tres etapas para diferentes casos. Totalmente hay ocho casos, | D |= 1 o | D |> 1, k = l o k <l, w = 0 o w = 1. La segmentación de documentos individuales sin agrupación de término y estimación de peso de término (| d | = 1, k = l, w = 0) solo requiere la etapa 1 (paso 1). Si se requiere la agrupación de términos (k <l), la etapa 2 (paso 2.1, 2.2 y 2.3) se ejecuta de forma iterativa. Si se requiere una estimación de peso a término (w = 1), la etapa 3 (paso 3.1, 3.2 y 3.3) se ejecuta de forma iterativa. Si se requieren ambos (k <l, w = 1), las etapas 2 y 3 corren uno tras otro. Para la segmentación de documentos múltiples sin agrupación de término y estimación de peso de término (| d |> 1, k = l, w = 0), solo se requiere iteración del paso 2.2 y 2.3. En la etapa 1, el máximo global se puede encontrar basado en I (ˆT; ˆs) usando programación dinámica en la Sección 4.4. Simultáneamente, encontrar una agrupación de buen término y los pesos de término estimados es imposible, ya que al trasladar un término a un nuevo clúster de término para maximizar IW (ˆt; ˆs), no sabemos que el peso de este término debería ser el nuevo clústero el viejo clúster. Por lo tanto, primero hacemos la agrupación de términos en la etapa 2, y luego estimamos los pesos de término en la etapa 3. En la etapa 2, el paso 2.1 es encontrar la mejor agrupación de término y el paso 2.2 es encontrar la mejor segmentación. Este ciclo se repite para encontrar un máximo local basado en MI I hasta que converge. Los dos pasos son: (1) basado en la agrupación de términos actuales Cluˆt, para cada documento D, los segmentos de algoritmo todas las oraciones SD en segmentos P secuencialmente (algunos segmentos pueden estar vacíos), y las colocan en los segmentos p de todoConjunto de capacitación D (todos los casos posibles de diferentes segmentación SEGD y alineación Alid se verifican) para encontrar el caso óptimo, y (2) basado en la segmentación y alineación actuales, para cada término t, el algoritmo encuentra el mejor clúster de término de T basado en TEn el SEGD y la alineación de segmentación actual. Después de encontrar una agrupación de buen término, los pesos de término se estiman si w = 1. En la etapa 3, similar como la etapa 2, el paso 3.1 es la restimación de peso a término y el paso 3.2 es encontrar una mejor segmentación. Se repiten para encontrar un máximo local basado en WMI IW hasta que converge. Sin embargo, si el término agrupación en la etapa 2 no es precisa, entonces la estimación de peso del término en la etapa 3 puede tener un mal resultado. Finalmente, en el paso 3.3, este algoritmo converge y devuelve la salida. Este algoritmo puede manejar tanto el documento único como la segmentación de múltiples documentos. También puede detectar temas compartidos entre documentos verificando la proporción de oraciones superpuestas sobre los mismos temas, como se describe en la Sec.4.4 Optimización del algoritmo En muchos trabajos anteriores sobre segmentación, la programación dinámica es una técnica utilizada para maximizar la función objetivo. Del mismo modo, en el paso 1, 2.2 y 3.2 de nuestro algoritmo, podemos usar programación dinámica. Para la etapa 1, el uso de programación dinámica aún puede encontrar el óptimo global, pero para la etapa 2 y la etapa 3, solo podemos encontrar el óptimo para cada paso de la segmentación de temas y la alineación de un documento. Aquí solo mostramos la programación dinámica para el paso 3.2 usando WMI (el paso 1 y 2.2 son similares, pero pueden usar I o IW). Hay dos casos que no se muestran en el algoritmo en la Figura 2: (a) segmentación de un solo documento o segmentación de múltiples documentos con el mismo orden secuencial de segmentos, donde no se requiere alineación, y (b) segmentación múltiple conDiferentes órdenes secuenciales de segmentos, donde es necesaria la alineación. La función de mapeo de alineación del primer caso es simplemente alid (ˆsi) = ˆSi, mientras que para la última función de mapeo de alineación de alineación (ˆsi) = ˆSJ, I y J pueden ser diferentes. Los pasos computacionales para los dos casos se enumeran a continuación: Caso 1 (sin alineación): para cada documento D: (1) Calcule PW (ˆT), PW parcial (ˆt, ˆs) y PW parcial (ˆ) sin contar oraciones de D.Luego coloque oraciones de I a J en la Parte K, y calcule WMI PIW (ˆT; ˆSK (Si, Si+1, ..., Sj)) ˆT∈ ˆT PW (ˆT, ˆSK) log PW (ˆT, ˆSK)PW (ˆT) PW (ˆSK), donde Alid (Si, Si+1, ..., Sj) = K, K ∈ {1, 2, ..., P}, 1 ≤ I ≤ J ≤ Nd, ySEGD (SQ) = ˆSK para todos los i ≤ q ≤ j.(2) Sea M (Sm, 1) = PIW (ˆT; ˆS1 (S1, S2, ..., SM)). Entonces m (sm, l) = maxi [m (si - 1, l - 1) + piw (ˆt; ˆsl (si, ..., sm))], donde 0 ≤ m ≤ nd, 1 <l <l, 1 ≤ I ≤ m + 1, y cuando i> m, no se ponen oraciones en ˆSK cuando calculan PIW (nota PIW (ˆT; ˆs (Si, ..., Sm)) = 0 para la segmentación de un solo documento).(3) Finalmente m (Snd, P) = maxi [M (Si - 1, P - 1)+ PIW (ˆT; ˆSp (Si, ..., SND))], donde 1 ≤ I ≤ nd+ 1. Se encuentra el IW óptimo y la segmentación correspondiente es la mejor. Caso 2 (se requiere alineación): para cada documento d: (1) Calcule PW (ˆT), PW parcial (ˆT, ˆS) y PW parcial (ˆs) y PIW (ˆT; ˆSK (Si, Si+1 ,..., sj)) Del mismo modo como el caso 1. (2) Sea M (Sm, 1, K) = Piw (ˆT; ˆSk (S1, S2, ..., Sm)), donde k ∈ {1, 2, 2,..., pags}. Entonces M (Sm, L, Kl) = Maxi, J [M (Si - 1, L - 1, Kl/J) + PIW (ˆT; ˆSalid (ˆSl) = J (Si, Si + 1, ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ...,sm))], donde 0 ≤ m ≤ nd, 1 <l <p, 1 ≤ i ≤ m + 1, kl ∈ Set (p, l), que es el conjunto de todas las p! ¡L! (P - L)!Combinaciones de segmentos L elegidos de todos los segmentos P, J ∈ Kl, el conjunto de segmentos L elegidos de todos los segmentos P, y KL/J es la combinación de segmentos L - 1 en KL excepto el segmento J.(3) Finalmente, M (Snd, P, Kp) = Maxi, J [M (Si - 1, P - 1, Kp/J) +PIW (ˆT; ˆSalid (ˆll) = J (Si, Si +1,..., snd))], donde KP es solo la combinación de todos los segmentos P y 1 ≤ I ≤ nd + 1, que es la IW óptima y la segmentación correspondiente es la mejor. Los pasos del caso 1 y 2 son similares, excepto en el caso 2, la alineación se considera además de la segmentación. Primero, los elementos básicos de probabilidad para calcular IW se calculan excluyendo Doc D, y luego WMI parcial colocando cada segmento secuencial posible (incluido el segmento vacío) de D en cada segmento del conjunto. En segundo lugar, se encuentra la suma óptima de PIW para los segmentos L y las oraciones más a la izquierda, M (SM, L). Finalmente, el WMI máximo se encuentra entre diferentes sumas de M (SM, P - 1) y PIW para el segmento P.5. Se probarán experimentos en esta sección, segmentación de un solo documento, detección de temas compartidos y segmentación de documentos múltiples. Se estudian diferentes hiper parámetros de nuestro método. Por conveniencia, nos referimos al método usando i como mik si w = 0, e iw como wmik si w = 2 o como wmik si w = 1, donde k es el número de clústeres de término, y si k = l, donde les el número total de términos, entonces no se requiere una agrupación de términos, es decir, Mil y Wmil.5.1 Segmentación de un solo documento 5.1.1 Datos y evaluación de prueba El primer conjunto de datos que probamos es uno sintético utilizado en investigaciones anteriores [6, 15, 25] y muchos otros documentos. Tiene 700 muestras. Cada uno es una concatenación de diez segmentos. Cada segmento es la primera n oración seleccionada al azar del Corpus Brown, que se supone que tiene un tema diferente entre sí. Actualmente, los mejores resultados en este conjunto de datos lo logran Ji et.al.[15]. Para comparar el rendimiento de nuestros métodos, se aplica ampliamente el criterio utilizado ampliamente en investigaciones anteriores, en lugar del criterio imparcial introducido en [20]. Elige un par de palabras al azar. Si están en diferentes segmentos (diferentes) para la segmentación real (real), pero predicho (pred) como en el mismo segmento, es una falla. Si están en el mismo segmento (igual), pero predichos como en diferentes segmentos, es una falsa alarma. Por lo tanto, la tasa de error se calcula utilizando la siguiente ecuación: p (err | real, pred) = p (señorita | real, pred, diff) p (diff | real) +p (falsa alarma | real, pred, lo mismo) p(Igual | Real).5.1.2 Resultados del experimento probamos el caso cuando se conoce el número de segmentos. La Tabla 1 muestra los resultados de nuestros métodos con diferentes valores de hiper parámetros y tres enfoques anteriores, C99 [25], U00 [6] y ADDP03 [15], en este conjunto de datos cuando se conoce el número de segmento. En WMI para la segmentación de un solo documento, los pesos del término se calculan de la siguiente manera: wˆt = 1–eˆs (ˆt)/maxˆt ∈ ˆt (eˆs (ˆt)). Para este caso, nuestros métodos MIL y WMIL superan a todos los enfoques anteriores. Comparamos nuestros métodos con la prueba T unilateral unilateral de ADDP03using unilateral y los valores P se muestran en la Tabla 2. A partir de los valores p, podemos ver que principalmente las diferencias son muy importantes: tasas de error promedio de segmentación de un solo documento dada números de segmento rango conocido de n 3-11 3-5 6-8 9-11 Tamaño de muestra 400 100 100 100 100 100100 C99 12% 11% 10% 9% U00 10% 9% 7% 5% ADDP03 6.0% 6.8% 5.2% 4.3% mil 4.68% 5.57% 2.59% 1.59% WMIL 4.94% 6.33% 2.76% 1.62% MI100 9.62% 12.92% 8.66% 6.67% Tabla 2: Segmentación de un solo documento: Valores p de la prueba t en el rango de tasas de error de N 3-11 3-5 6-8 9-11 ADDP03, MIL 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 ADDP03, WMIL 0.000 0.0990.000 0.000 mil, WMIL 0.061 0.132 0.526 0.898 significativo. También comparamos las tasas de error entre nuestros dos métodos utilizando la prueba t de dos lados de dos muestras para verificar la hipótesis de que son iguales. No podemos rechazar la hipótesis de que son iguales, por lo que la diferencia no es significativa, aunque todas las tasas de error para MIL son más pequeñas que WMIL. Sin embargo, podemos concluir que los pesos del término contribuyen poco en la segmentación de un solo documento. Los resultados también muestran que el MI que usa la clúster de términos (k = 100) disminuye el rendimiento. Probamos diferentes grupos de grupos y descubrimos que el rendimiento mejora cuando el número de clúster aumenta para alcanzar l.Wmik <L tiene resultados similares que no mostramos en la tabla. Como se mencionó anteriormente, el uso de MI puede ser inconsistente en los límites óptimos dados diferentes números de segmentos. Esta situación ocurre especialmente cuando las similitudes entre los segmentos son bastante diferentes, es decir, algunas transiciones son muy obvias, mientras que otras no. Esto se debe a que generalmente un documento es una estructura jerárquica en lugar de solo una estructura secuencial. Cuando los segmentos no están al mismo nivel, esta situación puede ocurrir. Por lo tanto, se desea un enfoque de segmentación de temas jerárquico, y la estructura depende en gran medida del número de segmentos para cada nodo interno y los criterios de división de división. Para este conjunto de datos de segmentación de SingledOcument, dado que es solo un conjunto sintético, que es solo una concatenación de varios segmentos sobre diferentes temas, es razonable que los enfoques simplemente basados en la frecuencia de términos tengan un buen rendimiento. Por lo general, para las tareas de segmentar documentos coherentes para los subtópicos, la efectividad disminuye mucho.5.2 Detección de temas compartidos 5.2.1 Datos y evaluación de pruebas El segundo conjunto de datos contiene 80 artículos de noticias de Google News. Hay ocho temas y cada uno tiene 10 artículos. Dividimos aleatoriamente el conjunto en subconjuntos con diferentes números de documentos y cada subconjunto tiene los ocho temas. Comparamos nuestro enfoque MIL y WMIL con LDA [4]. LDA trata un documento en el conjunto de datos como una bolsa de palabras, encuentra su distribución en los temas y su tema principal. MIL y WMIL ve cada oración como una bolsa de palabras y la etiquetan con una etiqueta de tema. Luego, para cada par de documentos, LDA determina si están en el mismo tema, mientras que MIL y Tabla 3: Detección de temas compartidos: tasas de error promedio para diferentes números de documentos en cada subconjunto #DOC 10 20 40 80 LDA 8.89% 16.33% 1.35% 0.60% mil, θ = 0.6 4.17% 1.71% 1.47% 0.0% WMIL, θ = 0.8 18.6% 3.16% 1.92% 0.0% WMIL Verifique si la proporción superpuesta las oraciones en el mismo tema es mayor que el umbral ajustable θ. Es decir, en Mil y Wmil, para un par de documentos d, d, if [s∈Sd, s ∈Sd 1 (temas = temas)/min (| sd |, | sd |)]> θ, donde sd está esEl conjunto de oraciones de D, y | SD |es el número de oraciones de D, entonces D y D tienen el tema compartido. Para un par de documentos seleccionados al azar, la tasa de error se calcula utilizando la siguiente ecuación: p (err | real, pred) = p (señorita | real, pred, lo mismo) p (mismo | real) +p (falsa alarma | real, pred, diff) p (diff | real), donde una falla significa si tiene el mismo tema (mismo) para el caso real (real), pero predicho (pred) como en el mismo tema. Si están en diferentes temas (DIFF), pero predichos como en el mismo tema, es una falsa alarma.5.2.2 Resultados del experimento Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 3. Si la mayoría de los documentos tienen temas diferentes, en WMIL, la estimación de los pesos de los términos en la ecuación (3) no es correcta. Por lo tanto, no se espera que WMIL tenga un mejor rendimiento que MIL, cuando la mayoría de los documentos tienen temas diferentes. Cuando hay menos documentos en un subconjunto con el mismo número de temas, más documentos tienen diferentes temas, por lo que WMIL es más peor que MIL. Podemos ver que para la mayoría de los casos MIL tiene un rendimiento mejor (o al menos similar) que LDA. Después de la detección de temas compartidos, se puede ejecutar la segmentación de documentos de documentos múltiples con los temas compartidos.5.3 Segmentación de documentos múltiples 5.3.1 Datos de prueba y evaluación para la segmentación y alineación de múltiples documentos, nuestro objetivo es identificar estos segmentos sobre el mismo tema entre múltiples documentos similares con temas compartidos. Se espera que el uso de IW funcione mejor que yo, ya que sin pesos de término, el resultado se ve afectado seriamente por las palabras de parada dependientes del documento y las palabras ruidosas que depende del estilo de escritura personal. Es más probable que trate los mismos segmentos de diferentes documentos que diferentes segmentos bajo el efecto de las palabras de parada dependientes del documento y las palabras ruidosas. Los pesos de términos pueden reducir el efecto de las palabras de detención dependientes del documento y las palabras ruidosas al dar más pesos a los términos de la señal. El conjunto de datos para la segmentación y alineación de varios documentos tiene 102 muestras y 2264 oraciones totalmente. Cada uno es la parte de introducción de un informe de laboratorio seleccionado desde el curso de Biol 240W, Universidad Estatal de Pensilvania. Cada muestra tiene dos segmentos, la introducción de las hormonas vegetales y el contenido en el laboratorio. El rango de longitud de las muestras es de dos a 56 oraciones. Algunas muestras solo tienen una parte y otras tienen un orden inverso de estos dos segmentos. No es difícil identificar el límite entre dos segmentos para humanos. Etiquetamos cada oración manualmente para su evaluación. El criterio de la evaluación es solo utilizar la proporción del número de oraciones con etiquetas de segmento predichas predichas incorrectas en el número total de oraciones en toda la Tabla de entrenamiento 4: tasas de error promedio de la segmentación de múltiples documentos dados los números de segmento conocidosWMIK 102 3.14% 2.78% 300 4.68% 6.58% 51 4.17% 3.63% 300 17.83% 22.84% 34 5.06% 4.12% 300 18.75% 20.95% 20 7.08% 5.42% 250 20.40% 21.83% 10 10.38% 7.89)% 5 15.77% 11.64% 250 21.89% 22.59% 2 25.90% 23.18% 50 25.44% 25.49% 1 23.90% 24.82% 25 25.75% 26.15% Tabla 5: segmentación de múltiples documentos: p-Valores de Test Tasales de error para tasas de error para tasas de errorMil y Wmil #DOC 51 34 20 10 5 2 2 P-Valor 0.19 0.101 0.025 0.001 0.000 0.002 Conjunto como la tasa de error: P (Error | Predicción, real) = D∈D S∈Sd 1 (predicción = Reals)/ D∈D nd. Para mostrar los beneficios de la segmentación y alineación de varios documentos, comparamos nuestro método con diferentes parámetros en diferentes particiones del mismo conjunto de capacitación. Excepto los casos de que el número de documentos es 102 y uno (son casos especiales de uso de todo el conjunto y la segmentación pura de un solo documento), dividimos aleatoriamente el conjunto de entrenamiento en particiones m, y cada uno tiene 51, 34, 20,10, 5 y 2 muestras de documentos. Luego aplicamos nuestros métodos en cada partición y calculamos la tasa de error de todo el conjunto de entrenamiento. Cada caso se repitió por 10 veces para calcular las tasas de error promedio. Para diferentes particiones del conjunto de entrenamiento, se utilizan diferentes valores de K, ya que el número de términos aumenta cuando aumenta el número de documento en cada partición.5.3.2 Resultados del experimento de los resultados del experimento en la Tabla 4, podemos ver las siguientes observaciones: (1) Cuando aumenta el número de documentos, todos los métodos tienen mejores rendimientos. Solo de uno a dos documentos, MIL ha disminuido un poco. Podemos observar esto de la Figura 3 en el punto del número de documento = 2. La mayoría de las curvas incluso tienen los peores resultados en este momento. Hay dos razones. Primero, debido a que las muestras votan por la mejor segmentación y alineación de múltiples documentos, pero si solo se comparan dos documentos entre sí, el que tiene segmentos faltantes o una secuencia totalmente diferente afectará la segmentación y la alineación correcta del otro. En segundo lugar, como se señaló al comienzo de esta sección, si dos documentos tienen más palabras de parada dependientes del documento o palabras ruidosas que las palabras de referencia, entonces el algoritmo puede verlos como dos segmentos diferentes y falta el otro segmento. En general, solo podemos esperar un mejor rendimiento cuando el número de documentos es mayor que el número de segmentos.(2) Excepto la segmentación de un solo documento, WMIL siempre es mejor que MIL, y cuando el número de documentos alcanza uno o aumenta a un número muy grande, sus actuaciones se vuelven más cercanas. La Tabla 5 muestra los valores P de la prueba t unilateral entre MIL y WMIL. También podemos ver esta tendencia de los valores P. Cuando el número de documento = 5, alcanzamos el valor p más pequeño y la mayor diferencia entre las tasas de error de MIL y WMIL. Para un solo documento Tabla 6: Segmentación de documentos múltiples: tasa de error promedio para el número de documento = 5 en cada subconjunto con un número diferente de clústeres de término #Cluster 75 100 150 250 L Mik 24.67% 24.54% 23.91% 22.59% 15.77% Segmentación, WMIL, WMILes incluso un poco peor que MIL, que es similar a los resultados de la segmentación de un solo documento en el primer conjunto de datos. La razón es que para la segmentación de SingledOcument, no podemos estimar los pesos de los términos con precisión, ya que múltiples documentos no están disponibles.(3) El uso de la agrupación de términos generalmente aumenta los resultados que MIL y WMIL.(4) El uso de la agrupación de términos en WMIK es aún peor que en Mik, ya que en WMIK los clústeres de término se encuentran primero usando I antes de usar IW. Si los clústeres de término no son correctos, los pesos del término se estiman peor, lo que puede engañar al algoritmo para alcanzar resultados aún peores. De los resultados también encontramos que en la segmentación y alineación de varios documentos, la mayoría de los documentos con segmentos faltantes y un orden inverso se identifican correctamente. La Tabla 6 ilustra los resultados del experimento para el caso de 20 particiones (cada una tiene cinco muestras de documentos) del conjunto de capacitación y la segmentación y alineación de temas utilizando MIK con diferentes números de grupos de término k.Observe que cuando aumenta el número de grupos de término, la tasa de error se vuelve más pequeña. Sin la agrupación de términos, tenemos el mejor resultado. No mostramos resultados para WMIK con la agrupación de términos, pero los resultados son similares. También probamos WMIL con diferentes hiper parámetros de A y B para ajustar los pesos de los términos. Los resultados se presentan en la Figura 3. Se demostró que el caso predeterminado WMIL: A = 1, B = 1 dio los mejores resultados para diferentes particiones del conjunto de entrenamiento. Podemos ver la tendencia de que cuando el número de documento es muy pequeño o grande, la diferencia entre mil: a = 0, b = 0 y wmil: a = 1, b = 1 se vuelve bastante pequeña. Cuando el número de documento no es grande (aproximadamente de 2 a 10), todos los casos que usan pesos de términos tienen mejores rendimientos que MIL: A = 0, B = 0 sin pesos de término, pero cuando el número de documento se hace más grande, los casos WMIL:a = 1, b = 0 y wmil: a = 2, b = 1 empeoran que mil: a = 0, b = 0. Cuando el número de documento se vuelve muy grande, son aún peores que los casos con pequeños números de documentos. Esto significa que es muy importante una forma adecuada de estimar los pesos de términos para el criterio de WMI. La Figura 4 muestra el término pesos aprendidos de todo el conjunto de entrenamiento. Cuatro tipos de palabras se clasifican aproximadamente a pesar de que la transición entre ellas es sutil. La Figura 5 ilustra el cambio en la información mutua (ponderada) para MIL y WMIL. Como se esperaba, la información mutua para MIL aumenta monotónicamente con el número de pasos, mientras que WMIL no. Finalmente, MIL y WMIL son escalables, con la complejidad computacional que se muestra en la Figura 6. Una ventaja para nuestro enfoque basado en MI es que no se requiere eliminar las palabras de detención. Otra ventaja importante es que no hay hiper parámetros necesarios para ajustar. En la segmentación de un solo documento, el rendimiento basado en MI es aún mejor para eso basado en WMI, por lo que no se requiere un hiper parámetro adicional. En la segmentación de varios documentos, mostramos en el experimento, A = 1 y B = 1 es el mejor. Nuestro método ofrece más pesos a los términos de la señal. Sin embargo, por lo general, los términos o oraciones de Cue aparecen al comienzo de un segmento, mientras que el final del segmento puede ser 1 2 5 10 20 20 34 51 102 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 Número de documento Errorrate MIL: A = 0, B =0 WMI L: A = 1, B = 1 WMI L: A = 1, B = 0 WMI L: A = 2, B = 1 Figura 3: Tasas de error para diferentes parámetros hiper de pesos de términos.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Entropía de documento normalizado Segmentalentropy Palabras ruidosas Cue palabras de parada común0 100 200 300 400 500 600 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 Número de pasos (ponderados) MI L MI L WMI L Figura 5: Cambio en (ponderado) MI para MIL y WMIL.0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 Número de documento TimetoConverge (SEC) MI L WMI L Figura 6: Tiempo para converger para MIL y WMIL.Mucho ruidoso. Una posible solución es dar más pesos al comienzo de cada segmento. Además, cuando la duración de los segmentos es bastante diferente, los segmentos largos tienen frecuencias a término mucho más altas, por lo que pueden dominar los límites de segmentación. La normalización de las frecuencias de términos versus la longitud del segmento puede ser útil.6. Conclusiones y trabajos futuros propusimos un método novedoso para la segmentación y alineación de temas multi-documentos basados en información mutua ponderada, que también puede manejar casos de un solo documento. Utilizamos una programación dinámica para optimizar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestro enfoque supera a todos los métodos anteriores en casos de colocación de solteres. Además, también demostramos que hacer segmentación entre múltiples documentos puede mejorar enormemente el rendimiento. Nuestros resultados también ilustraron que el uso de información mutua ponderada puede utilizar la información de múltiples documentos para alcanzar un mejor rendimiento. Solo probamos nuestro método en conjuntos de datos limitados. Se deben probar más conjuntos de datos especialmente complicados. Se deben comparar más métodos anteriores con. Además, las segmentos naturales como los párrafos son sugerencias que se pueden usar para encontrar los límites óptimos. El aprendizaje supervisado también puede considerarse.7.

        "Topic segmentation intends to identify the boundaries in a document with the goal to capture the latent topical structure.",
        "Topic segmentation tasks usually fall into two categories [15]: text stream segmentation where topic transition is identified, and coherent document segmentation in which documents are split into sub-topics.",
        "The former category has applications in automatic speech recognition, while the latter one has more applications such as partial-text query of long documents in information retrieval, text summary, and quality measurement of multiple documents.",
        "Previous research in connection with TDT falls into the former category, targeted on topic tracking of broadcast speech data and newswire text, while the latter category has not been studied very well.",

        "At a finer granularity, users may actually be looking to obtain sections of a document similar to a particular section that presumably discusses a topic of the users interest.",
        "Thus, the extension of topic segmentation from single documents to identifying similar segments from multiple similar documents with the same topic is a natural and necessary direction, and multi-document topic segmentation is expected to have a better performance since more information is utilized.",
        "Traditional approaches using similarity measurement based on term frequency generally have the same assumption that similar vocabulary tends to be in a coherent topic segment [15, 25, 6].",
        "However, they usually suffer the issue of identifying stop words.",

        "Supervised learning usually has good performance, since it learns functions from labelled training sets.",
        "However, often getting large training sets with manual labels on document sentences is prohibitively expensive, so unsupervised approaches are desired.",
        "Some models consider dependence between sentences and sections, such as Hidden Markov Model [3, 27], Maximum Entropy Markov Model [19], and Conditional Random Fields [17], while many other approaches are based on lexical cohesion or similarity of sentences [5, 6, 15, 25, 21].",
        "Some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11].",
        "While some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others utilize multiple documents [16, 14].",
        "There are not many works in the latter category, even though the performance of segmentation is expected to be better with utilization of information from multiple documents.",
        "Previous research studied methods to find shared topics [16] and topic segmentation and summarization between just a pair of documents [14].",
        "Text classification and clustering is a related research area which categorizes documents into groups using supervised or unsupervised methods.",
        "Topical classification or clustering is an important direction in this area, especially co-clustering of documents and terms, such as LSA [9], PLSA [13], and approaches based on distances and bipartite graph partitioning [28] or maximum MI [2, 10], or maximum entropy [1, 18].",
        "Criteria of these approaches can be utilized in the issue of topic segmentation.",
        "Some of those methods have been extended into the area of topic segmentation, such as PLSA [5] and maximum entropy [7], but to our best knowledge, using MI for topic segmentation has not been studied. 3.",
        "PROBLEM FORMULATION Our goal is to segment documents and align the segments across documents (Figure 1).",
        "Let T be the set of terms {t1, t2, ..., tl}, which appear in the unlabelled set of documents D = {d1, d2, ..., dm}.",
        "Let Sd be the set of sentences for document d ∈ D, i.e. {s1, s2, ..., snd }.",
        "We have a 3D matrix of term frequency, in which the three dimensions are random variables of D, Sd, and T. Sd actually is a random vector including a random variable for each d ∈ D. The term frequency can be used to estimate the joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T), which is p(t, d, s) = T(t, d, s)/ND, where T(t, d, s) is the number of t in ds sentence s and ND is the total number of terms in D. ˆS represents the set of segments {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} after segmentation and alignment among multiple documents, where the number of segments | ˆS| = p. A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic.",
        "The goal is to find the optimal topic segmentation and alignment mapping Segd(si) : {s1, s2, ..., snd } → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} and Alid(ˆsi) : {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp}, for all d ∈ D, where ˆsi is ith segment with the constraint that only adjacent sentences can be mapped to the same segment, i.e. for d, {si, si+1, ..., sj} → {ˆsq}, where q ∈ {1, ..., p}, where p is the segment number, and if i > j, then for d, ˆsq is missing.",
        "After segmentation and alignment, random vector Sd becomes an aligned random variable ˆS.",
        "Thus, P(D, Sd, T) becomes P(D, ˆS, T).",
        "Term co-clustering is a technique that has been employed [10] to improve the accuracy of document clustering.",
        "We evaluate the effect of it for topic segmentation.",
        "A term t is mapped to exactly one term cluster.",
        "Term co-clustering involves simultaneously finding the optimal term clustering mapping Clu(t) : {t1, t2, ..., tl} → {ˆt1, ˆt2, ..., ˆtk}, where k ≤ l, l is the total number of words in all the documents, and k is the number of clusters. 4.",
        "METHODOLOGY We now describe a novel algorithm which can handle singledocument segmentation, shared topic detection, and multidocument segmentation and alignment based on MI or WMI. 4.1 Mutual Information MI I(X; Y ) is a quantity to measure the amount of information which is contained in two or more random variables [8, 10].",
        "For the case of two random variables, we have I(X; Y ) = x∈X y∈Y p(x, y)log p(x, y) p(x)p(y) , (1) Obviously, when random variables X and Y are independent, I(X; Y ) = 0.",
        "Thus, intuitively, the value of MI depends on how random variables are dependent on each other.",
        "The optimal co-clustering is the mapping Clux : X → ˆX and Cluy : Y → ˆY that minimizes the loss: I(X; Y ) − I( ˆX; ˆY ), which is equal to maximizing I( ˆX; ˆY ).",
        "This is the criterion of MI for clustering.",
        "In the case of topic segmentation, the two random variables are the term variable T and the segment variable S, and each sample is an occurrence of a term T = t in a particular segment S = s. I(T; S) is used to measure how dependent T and S are.",
        "However, I(T; S) cannot be computed for documents before segmentation, since we do not have a set of S due to the fact that sentences of Document d, si ∈ Sd, is not aligned with other documents.",
        "Thus, instead of minimizing the loss of MI, we can maximize MI after topic segmentation, computed as: I( ˆT; ˆS) = ˆt∈ ˆT ˆs∈ ˆS p(ˆt, ˆs)log p(ˆt, ˆs) p(ˆt)p(ˆs) , (2) where p(ˆt, ˆs) are estimated by the term frequency tf of Term Cluster ˆt and Segment ˆs in the training set D.

        "The optimal solution is the mapping Clut : T → ˆT, Segd : Sd → ˆS , and Alid : ˆS → ˆS, which maximizes I( ˆT; ˆS). 4.2 Weighted Mutual Information In topic segmentation and alignment of multiple documents, if P(D, ˆS, T) is known, based on the marginal distributions P(D|T) and P( ˆS|T) for each term t ∈ T, we can categorize terms into four types in the data set: • Common stop words are common both along the dimensions of documents and segments. • Document-dependent stop words that depends on the personal writing style are common only along the dimension of segments for some documents. • Cue words are the most important elements for segmentation.",
        "They are common along the dimension of documents only for the same segment, and they are not common along the dimensions of segments. • Noisy words are other words which are not common along both dimensions.",
        "Entropy based on P(D|T) and P( ˆS|T) can be used to identify different types of terms.",
        "To reinforce the contribution of cue words in the MI computation, and simultaneously reduce the effect of the other three types of words, similar as the idea of the tf-idf weight [22], we use entropies of each term along the dimensions of document D and segment ˆS, i.e.",
        "ED(ˆt) and EˆS(ˆt), to compute the weight.",
        "A cue word usually has a large value of ED(ˆt) but a small value of EˆS(ˆt).",
        "We introduce term weights (or term cluster weights) wˆt = ( ED(ˆt) maxˆt ∈ ˆT (ED(ˆt )) )a (1 − EˆS(ˆt) maxˆt ∈ ˆT (EˆS(ˆt )) )b , (3) where ED(ˆt) = d∈D p(d|ˆt)log|D| 1 p(d|ˆt) , EˆS(ˆt) = ˆs∈ ˆS p(ˆs|ˆt)log| ˆS| 1 p(ˆs|ˆt) , and a > 0 and b > 0 are powers to adjust term weights.",
        "Usually a = 1 and b = 1 as default, and maxˆt ∈ ˆT (ED(ˆt )) and maxˆt ∈ ˆT (EˆS(ˆt )) are used to normalize the entropy values.",
        "Term cluster weights are used to adjust p(ˆt, ˆs), pw(ˆt, ˆs) = wˆtp(ˆt, ˆs) ˆt∈ ˆT ;ˆs∈ ˆS wˆtp(ˆt, ˆs) , (4) and Iw( ˆT; ˆS) = ˆt∈ ˆT ˆs∈ ˆS pw(ˆt, ˆs)log pw(ˆt, ˆs) pw(ˆt)pw(ˆs) , (5) where pw(ˆt) and pw(ˆs) are marginal distributions of pw(ˆt, ˆs).",
        "However, since we do not know either the term weights or P(D, ˆS, T), we need to estimate them, but wˆt depends on p(ˆs|t) and ˆS, while ˆS and p(ˆs|t) also depend on wˆt that is still unknown.",

        "Then the joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T) can be estimated.",
        "Finally, this distribution can be used to compute MI in our algorithm. 4.3 Iterative Greedy Algorithm Our goal is to maximize the objective function, I( ˆT; ˆS) or Iw( ˆT; ˆS), which can measure the dependence of term occurrences in different segments.",
        "Generally, first we do not know the estimate term weights, which depend on the optimal topic segmentation and alignment, and term clusters.",
        "Moreover, this problem is NP-hard [10], even though if we know the term weights.",
        "Thus, an iterative greedy algorithm is desired to find the best solution, even though probably only local maxima are reached.",
        "We present the iterative greedy algorithm in Figure 2 to find a local maximum of I( ˆT; ˆS) or Iw( ˆT; ˆS) with simultaneous term weight estimation.",
        "This algorithm can is iterative and greedy for multi-document cases or single-document cases with term weight estimation and/or term co-clustering.",
        "Otherwise, since it is just a one step algorithm to solve the task of single-document segmentation [6, 15, 25], the global maximum of MI is guaranteed.",
        "We will show later that term co-clustering reduces the accuracy of the results and is not necessary, and for singledocument segmentation, term weights are also not required. 4.3.1 Initialization In Step 0, the initial term clustering Clut and topic segmentation and alignment Segd and Alid are important to avoid local maxima and reduce the number of iterations.",
        "First, a good guess of term weights can be made by using the distributions of term frequency along sentences for each document and averaging them to get the initial values of wˆt: wt = ( ED(t) maxt ∈T (ED(t )) )(1 − ES(t) maxt ∈T (ES(t )) ), (6) where ES(t) = 1 |Dt| d∈Dt (1 − s∈Sd p(s|t)log|Sd| 1 p(s|t) ), where Dt is the set of documents which contain Term t. Then, for the initial segmentation Seg(0) , we can simply segment documents equally by sentences.",
        "Or we can find the optimal segmentation just for each document d which maximizes the WMI, Seg (0) d = argmaxˆsIw(T; ˆS), where w = w (0) ˆt .",
        "For the initial alignment Ali(0) , we can first assume that the order of segments for each d is the same.",
        "For the initial term clustering Clu(0) , first cluster labels can be set randomly, and after the first time of Step 3, a good initial term clustering is obtained. 4.3.2 Different Cases After initialization, there are three stages for different cases.",
        "Totally there are eight cases, |D| = 1 or |D| > 1, k = l or k < l, w = 0 or w = 1.",
        "Single document segmentation without term clustering and term weight estimation (|D| = 1, k = l, w = 0) only requires Stage 1 (Step 1).",
        "If term clustering is required (k < l), Stage 2 (Step 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) is executed iteratively.",
        "If term weight estimation is required (w = 1), Stage 3 (Step 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3) is executed iteratively.",
        "If both are required (k < l, w = 1), Stage 2 and 3 run one after the other.",
        "For multi-document segmentation without term clustering and term weight estimation (|D| > 1, k = l, w = 0), only iteration of Step 2.2 and 2.3 are required.",
        "At Stage 1, the global maximum can be found based on I( ˆT; ˆS) using dynamic programming in Section 4.4.",
        "Simultaneously finding a good term clustering and estimated term weights is impossible, since when moving a term to a new term cluster to maximize Iw( ˆT; ˆS), we do not know that the weight of this term should be the one of the new cluster or the old cluster.",
        "Thus, we first do term clustering at Stage 2, and then estimate term weights at Stage 3.",
        "At Stage 2, Step 2.1 is to find the best term clustering and Step 2.2 is to find the best segmentation.",
        "This cycle is repeated to find a local maximum based on MI I until it converges.",
        "The two steps are: (1) based on current term clustering Cluˆt, for each document d, the algorithm segments all the sentences Sd into p segments sequentially (some segments may be empty), and put them into the p segments ˆS of the whole training set D (all possible cases of different segmentation Segd and alignment Alid are checked) to find the optimal case, and (2) based on the current segmentation and alignment, for each term t, the algorithm finds the best term cluster of t based on the current segmentation Segd and alignment Alid.",
        "After finding a good term clustering, term weights are estimated if w = 1.",
        "At Stage 3, similar as Stage 2, Step 3.1 is term weight re-estimation and Step 3.2 is to find a better segmentation.",
        "They are repeated to find a local maximum based on WMI Iw until it converges.",
        "However, if the term clustering in Stage 2 is not accurate, then the term weight estimation at Stage 3 may have a bad result.",
        "Finally, at Step 3.3, this algorithm converges and return the output.",
        "This algorithm can handle both single-document and multi-document segmentation.",
        "It also can detect shared topics among documents by checking the proportion of overlapped sentences on the same topics, as described in Sec 5.2. 4.4 Algorithm Optimization In many previous works on segmentation, dynamic programming is a technique used to maximize the objective function.",
        "Similarly, at Step 1, 2.2, and 3.2 of our algorithm, we can use dynamic programming.",
        "For Stage 1, using dynamic programming can still find the global optimum, but for Stage 2 and Stage 3, we can only find the optimum for each step of topic segmentation and alignment of a document.",
        "Here we only show the dynamic programming for Step 3.2 using WMI (Step 1 and 2.2 are similar but they can use either I or Iw).",
        "There are two cases that are not shown in the algorithm in Figure 2: (a) single-document segmentation or multi-document segmentation with the same sequential order of segments, where alignment is not required, and (b) multi-document segmentation with different sequential orders of segments, where alignment is necessary.",
        "The alignment mapping function of the former case is simply just Alid(ˆsi) = ˆsi, while for the latter ones alignment mapping function Alid(ˆsi) = ˆsj, i and j may be different.",
        "The computational steps for the two cases are listed below: Case 1 (no alignment): For each document d: (1) Compute pw(ˆt), partial pw(ˆt, ˆs) and partial pw(ˆs) without counting sentences from d. Then put sentences from i to j into Part k, and compute partial WMI PIw( ˆT; ˆsk(si, si+1, ..., sj)) ˆt∈ ˆT pw(ˆt, ˆsk)log pw(ˆt, ˆsk) pw(ˆt)pw(ˆsk) , where Alid(si, si+1, ..., sj) = k, k ∈ {1, 2, ..., p}, 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ nd, and Segd(sq) = ˆsk for all i ≤ q ≤ j. (2) Let M(sm, 1) = PIw( ˆT; ˆs1(s1, s2, ..., sm)).",
        "Then M(sm, L) = maxi[M(si−1, L − 1) + PIw( ˆT; ˆsL(si, ..., sm))], where 0 ≤ m ≤ nd, 1 < L < p, 1 ≤ i ≤ m + 1, and when i > m, no sentences are put into ˆsk when compute PIw (note PIw( ˆT; ˆs(si, ..., sm)) = 0 for single-document segmentation). (3) Finally M(snd , p) = maxi[M(si−1, p − 1)+ PIw( ˆT; ˆsp(si, ..., snd ))], where 1 ≤ i ≤ nd+1.",
        "The optimal Iw is found and the corresponding segmentation is the best.",
        "Case 2 (alignment required): For each document d: (1) Compute pw(ˆt), partial pw(ˆt, ˆs), and partial pw(ˆs), and PIw( ˆT; ˆsk(si, si+1, ..., sj)) similarly as Case 1. (2) Let M(sm, 1, k) = PIw( ˆT; ˆsk(s1, s2, ..., sm)), where k ∈ {1, 2, ..., p}.",
        "Then M(sm, L, kL) = maxi,j[M(si−1, L − 1, kL/j) + PIw( ˆT; ˆsAlid(ˆsL )=j(si, si+1, ..., sm))], where 0 ≤ m ≤ nd, 1 < L < p, 1 ≤ i ≤ m + 1, kL ∈ Set(p, L), which is the set of all p!",
        "L!(p−L)! combinations of L segments chosen from all p segments, j ∈ kL, the set of L segments chosen from all p segments, and kL/j is the combination of L − 1 segments in kL except Segment j.

        "The steps of Case 1 and 2 are similar, except in Case 2, alignment is considered in addition to segmentation.",
        "First, basic items of probability for computing Iw are computed excluding Doc d, and then partial WMI by putting every possible sequential segment (including empty segment) of d into every segment of the set.",
        "Second, the optimal sum of PIw for L segments and the leftmost m sentences, M(sm, L), is found.",
        "Finally, the maximal WMI is found among different sums of M(sm, p − 1) and PIw for Segment p. 5.",
        "EXPERIMENTS In this section, single-document segmentation, shared topic detection, and multi-document segmentation will be tested.",
        "Different hyper parameters of our method are studied.",
        "For convenience, we refer to the method using I as MIk if w = 0, and Iw as WMIk if w = 2 or as WMIk if w = 1, where k is the number of term clusters, and if k = l, where l is the total number of terms, then no term clustering is required, i.e.",

        "This situation occurs especially when the similarities among segments are quite different, i.e. some transitions are very obvious, while others are not.",

A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic.",

                "Some models consider dependence between sentences and sections, such as Hidden Markov Model [3, 27], Maximum Entropy Markov Model [19], and Conditional Random Fields [17], while many other approaches are based on lexical cohesion or similarity of sentences [5, 6, 15, 25, 21].",
                "Some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11].",
                "While some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others utilize multiple documents [16, 14].",
                "There are not many works in the latter category, even though the performance of segmentation is expected to be better with utilization of information from multiple documents.",
                "Previous research studied methods to find shared topics [16] and <br>topic segmentation</br> and summarization between just a pair of documents [14].",
                "Text classification and clustering is a related research area which categorizes documents into groups using supervised or unsupervised methods.",

The term frequency can be used to estimate the joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T), which is p(t, d, s) = T(t, d, s)/ND, where T(t, d, s) is the number of t in ds sentence s and ND is the total number of terms in D. ˆS represents the set of segments {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} after segmentation and alignment among multiple documents, where the number of segments | ˆS| = p. A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic.",
                "The goal is to find the optimal <br>topic segmentation</br> and alignment mapping Segd(si) : {s1, s2, ..., snd } → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} and Alid(ˆsi) : {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp}, for all d ∈ D, where ˆsi is ith segment with the constraint that only adjacent sentences can be mapped to the same segment, i.e. for d, {si, si+1, ..., sj} → {ˆsq}, where q ∈ {1, ..., p}, where p is the segment number, and if i > j, then for d, ˆsq is missing.",
                "After segmentation and alignment, random vector Sd becomes an aligned random variable ˆS.",
                "Thus, P(D, Sd, T) becomes P(D, ˆS, T).",

                "However, I(T; S) cannot be computed for documents before segmentation, since we do not have a set of S due to the fact that sentences of Document d, si ∈ Sd, is not aligned with other documents.",
                "Thus, instead of minimizing the loss of MI, we can maximize MI after <br>topic segmentation</br>, computed as: I( ˆT; ˆS) = ˆt∈ ˆT ˆs∈ ˆS p(ˆt, ˆs)log p(ˆt, ˆs) p(ˆt)p(ˆs) , (2) where p(ˆt, ˆs) are estimated by the term frequency tf of Term Cluster ˆt and Segment ˆs in the training set D. Note that here a segment ˆs includes sentences about the the same topic among all documents.",

                "Topic segmentation intends to identify the boundaries in a document with the goal to capture the latent topical structure.",
                "Topic segmentation tasks usually fall into two categories [15]: text stream segmentation where topic transition is identified, and coherent document segmentation in which documents are split into sub-topics.",

                "At a finer granularity, users may actually be looking to obtain sections of a document similar to a particular section that presumably discusses a topic of the users interest.",
                "Thus, the extension of topic segmentation from single documents to identifying similar segments from multiple similar documents with the same topic is a natural and necessary direction, and multi-document topic segmentation is expected to have a better performance since more information is utilized.",
                "Traditional approaches using similarity measurement based on term frequency generally have the same assumption that similar vocabulary tends to be in a coherent topic segment [15, 25, 6].",

                "For example, additional document-dependent stop words are removed together with the generic stop words in [15].",
                "There are two reasons that we do not remove stop words directly.",

                "Removing common stop words may result in the loss of useful information in a specific domain.",
                "Second, even though stop words can be identified, hard classification of stop words and nonstop words cannot represent the gradually changing amount of information content of each word.",

                "The MI focuses on measuring the difference among segments whereas previous research focused on finding the similarity (e.g. cosine distance) of segments [15, 25, 6].",

                "PREVIOUS WORK Generally, the existing approaches to text segmentation fall into two categories: supervised learning [19, 17, 23] and unsupervised learning [3, 27, 5, 6, 15, 25, 21].",
                "Supervised learning usually has good performance, since it learns functions from labelled training sets.",
                "However, often getting large training sets with manual labels on document sentences is prohibitively expensive, so unsupervised approaches are desired.",
                "Some models consider dependence between sentences and sections, such as Hidden Markov Model [3, 27], Maximum Entropy Markov Model [19], and Conditional Random Fields [17], while many other approaches are based on lexical cohesion or similarity of sentences [5, 6, 15, 25, 21].",
                "Some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11].",
                "While some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others utilize multiple documents [16, 14].",
                "There are not many works in the latter category, even though the performance of segmentation is expected to be better with utilization of information from multiple documents.",
                "Previous research studied methods to find shared topics [16] and topic segmentation and summarization between just a pair of documents [14].",
                "Text classification and clustering is a related research area which categorizes documents into groups using supervised or unsupervised methods.",
                "Topical classification or clustering is an important direction in this area, especially co-clustering of documents and terms, such as LSA [9], PLSA [13], and approaches based on distances and bipartite graph partitioning [28] or maximum MI [2, 10], or maximum entropy [1, 18].",
                "Criteria of these approaches can be utilized in the issue of topic segmentation.",
                "Some of those methods have been extended into the area of topic segmentation, such as PLSA [5] and maximum entropy [7], but to our best knowledge, using MI for topic segmentation has not been studied. 3.",

                "We have a 3D matrix of term frequency, in which the three dimensions are random variables of D, Sd, and T. Sd actually is a random vector including a random variable for each d ∈ D. The term frequency can be used to estimate the joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T), which is p(t, d, s) = T(t, d, s)/ND, where T(t, d, s) is the number of t in ds sentence s and ND is the total number of terms in D. ˆS represents the set of segments {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} after segmentation and alignment among multiple documents, where the number of segments | ˆS| = p. A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic.",
                "The goal is to find the optimal topic segmentation and alignment mapping Segd(si) : {s1, s2, ..., snd } → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} and Alid(ˆsi) : {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp}, for all d ∈ D, where ˆsi is ith segment with the constraint that only adjacent sentences can be mapped to the same segment, i.e. for d, {si, si+1, ..., sj} → {ˆsq}, where q ∈ {1, ..., p}, where p is the segment number, and if i > j, then for d, ˆsq is missing.",
                "After segmentation and alignment, random vector Sd becomes an aligned random variable ˆS.",
                "Thus, P(D, Sd, T) becomes P(D, ˆS, T).",
                "Term co-clustering is a technique that has been employed [10] to improve the accuracy of document clustering.",

                "A term t is mapped to exactly one term cluster.",
                "Term co-clustering involves simultaneously finding the optimal term clustering mapping Clu(t) : {t1, t2, ..., tl} → {ˆt1, ˆt2, ..., ˆtk}, where k ≤ l, l is the total number of words in all the documents, and k is the number of clusters. 4.",
                "METHODOLOGY We now describe a novel algorithm which can handle singledocument segmentation, shared topic detection, and multidocument segmentation and alignment based on MI or WMI. 4.1 Mutual Information MI I(X; Y ) is a quantity to measure the amount of information which is contained in two or more random variables [8, 10].",
                "For the case of two random variables, we have I(X; Y ) = x∈X y∈Y p(x, y)log p(x, y) p(x)p(y) , (1) Obviously, when random variables X and Y are independent, I(X; Y ) = 0.",
                "Thus, intuitively, the value of MI depends on how random variables are dependent on each other.",
                "The optimal co-clustering is the mapping Clux : X → ˆX and Cluy : Y → ˆY that minimizes the loss: I(X; Y ) − I( ˆX; ˆY ), which is equal to maximizing I( ˆX; ˆY ).",
                "This is the criterion of MI for clustering.",
                "In the case of topic segmentation, the two random variables are the term variable T and the segment variable S, and each sample is an occurrence of a term T = t in a particular segment S = s. I(T; S) is used to measure how dependent T and S are.",
                "However, I(T; S) cannot be computed for documents before segmentation, since we do not have a set of S due to the fact that sentences of Document d, si ∈ Sd, is not aligned with other documents.",
                "Thus, instead of minimizing the loss of MI, we can maximize MI after topic segmentation, computed as: I( ˆT; ˆS) = ˆt∈ ˆT ˆs∈ ˆS p(ˆt, ˆs)log p(ˆt, ˆs) p(ˆt)p(ˆs) , (2) where p(ˆt, ˆs) are estimated by the term frequency tf of Term Cluster ˆt and Segment ˆs in the training set D. Note that here a segment ˆs includes sentences about the the same topic among all documents.",
                "The optimal solution is the mapping Clut : T → ˆT, Segd : Sd → ˆS , and Alid : ˆS → ˆS, which maximizes I( ˆT; ˆS). 4.2 Weighted Mutual Information In topic segmentation and alignment of multiple documents, if P(D, ˆS, T) is known, based on the marginal distributions P(D|T) and P( ˆS|T) for each term t ∈ T, we can categorize terms into four types in the data set: • Common stop words are common both along the dimensions of documents and segments. • Document-dependent stop words that depends on the personal writing style are common only along the dimension of segments for some documents. • Cue words are the most important elements for segmentation.",
                "They are common along the dimension of documents only for the same segment, and they are not common along the dimensions of segments. • Noisy words are other words which are not common along both dimensions.",

                "To reinforce the contribution of cue words in the MI computation, and simultaneously reduce the effect of the other three types of words, similar as the idea of the tf-idf weight [22], we use entropies of each term along the dimensions of document D and segment ˆS, i.e.",

A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d.

A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic.",

                "Some models consider dependence between sentences and sections, such as Hidden Markov Model [3, 27], Maximum Entropy Markov Model [19], and Conditional Random Fields [17], while many other approaches are based on lexical cohesion or similarity of sentences [5, 6, 15, 25, 21].",
                "Some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11].",
                "While some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others utilize multiple documents [16, 14].",
                "There are not many works in the latter category, even though the performance of segmentation is expected to be better with utilization of information from multiple documents.",

                "Topical classification or clustering is an important direction in this area, especially co-clustering of documents and terms, such as LSA [9], PLSA [13], and approaches based on distances and bipartite graph partitioning [28] or maximum MI [2, 10], or maximum entropy [1, 18].",

The term frequency can be used to estimate the joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T), which is p(t, d, s) = T(t, d, s)/ND, where T(t, d, s) is the number of t in ds sentence s and ND is the total number of terms in D. ˆS represents the set of segments {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} after segmentation and alignment among multiple documents, where the number of segments | ˆS| = p. A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic.",
                "The goal is to find the optimal topic segmentation and alignment mapping Segd(si) : {s1, s2, ..., snd } → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} and Alid(ˆsi) : {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp}, for all d ∈ D, where ˆsi is ith segment with the constraint that only adjacent sentences can be mapped to the same segment, i.e. for d, {si, si+1, ..., sj} → {ˆsq}, where q ∈ {1, ..., p}, where p is the segment number, and if i > j, then for d, ˆsq is missing.",
                "After segmentation and alignment, random vector Sd becomes an aligned random variable ˆS.",
                "Thus, P(D, Sd, T) becomes P(D, ˆS, T).",

                "However, I(T; S) cannot be computed for documents before segmentation, since we do not have a set of S due to the fact that sentences of Document d, si ∈ Sd, is not aligned with other documents.",

A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d.

                "Some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11].",

                "At a finer granularity, users may actually be looking to obtain sections of a document similar to a particular section that presumably discusses a topic of the users interest.",
                "Thus, the extension of topic segmentation from single documents to identifying similar segments from multiple similar documents with the same topic is a natural and necessary direction, and multi-document topic segmentation is expected to have a better performance since more information is utilized.",
                "Traditional approaches using similarity measurement based on term frequency generally have the same assumption that similar vocabulary tends to be in a coherent topic segment [15, 25, 6].",

                "However, often getting large training sets with manual labels on document sentences is prohibitively expensive, so unsupervised approaches are desired.",
                "Some models consider dependence between sentences and sections, such as Hidden Markov Model [3, 27], Maximum Entropy Markov Model [19], and Conditional Random Fields [17], while many other approaches are based on lexical cohesion or similarity of sentences [5, 6, 15, 25, 21].",
                "Some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11].",
                "While some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others utilize multiple documents [16, 14].",
                "There are not many works in the latter category, even though the performance of segmentation is expected to be better with utilization of information from multiple documents.",
                "Previous research studied methods to find shared topics [16] and topic segmentation and summarization between just a pair of documents [14].",
                "Text classification and clustering is a related research area which categorizes documents into groups using supervised or unsupervised methods.",
                "Topical classification or clustering is an important direction in this area, especially co-clustering of documents and terms, such as LSA [9], PLSA [13], and approaches based on distances and bipartite graph partitioning [28] or maximum MI [2, 10], or maximum entropy [1, 18].",
                "Criteria of these approaches can be utilized in the issue of topic segmentation.",
                "Some of those methods have been extended into the area of topic segmentation, such as PLSA [5] and maximum entropy [7], but to our best knowledge, using MI for topic segmentation has not been studied. 3.",

The term frequency can be used to estimate the joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T), which is p(t, d, s) = T(t, d, s)/ND, where T(t, d, s) is the number of t in ds sentence s and ND is the total number of terms in D. ˆS represents the set of segments {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} after segmentation and alignment among multiple documents, where the number of segments | ˆS| = p. A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic.",
                "The goal is to find the optimal topic segmentation and alignment mapping Segd(si) : {s1, s2, ..., snd } → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} and Alid(ˆsi) : {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp}, for all d ∈ D, where ˆsi is ith segment with the constraint that only adjacent sentences can be mapped to the same segment, i.e. for d, {si, si+1, ..., sj} → {ˆsq}, where q ∈ {1, ..., p}, where p is the segment number, and if i > j, then for d, ˆsq is missing.",
                "After segmentation and alignment, random vector Sd becomes an aligned random variable ˆS.",
                "Thus, P(D, Sd, T) becomes P(D, ˆS, T).",
                "Term co-clustering is a technique that has been employed [10] to improve the accuracy of document clustering.",

                "METHODOLOGY We now describe a novel algorithm which can handle singledocument segmentation, shared topic detection, and multidocument segmentation and alignment based on MI or WMI. 4.1 Mutual Information MI I(X; Y ) is a quantity to measure the amount of information which is contained in two or more random variables [8, 10].",

                "Thus, intuitively, the value of MI depends on how random variables are dependent on each other.",
                "The optimal co-clustering is the mapping Clux : X → ˆX and Cluy : Y → ˆY that minimizes the loss: I(X; Y ) − I( ˆX; ˆY ), which is equal to maximizing I( ˆX; ˆY ).",
                "This is the criterion of MI for clustering.",
                "In the case of topic segmentation, the two random variables are the term variable T and the segment variable S, and each sample is an occurrence of a term T = t in a particular segment S = s. I(T; S) is used to measure how dependent T and S are.",
                "However, I(T; S) cannot be computed for documents before segmentation, since we do not have a set of S due to the fact that sentences of Document d, si ∈ Sd, is not aligned with other documents.",
                "Thus, instead of minimizing the loss of MI, we can maximize MI after topic segmentation, computed as: I( ˆT; ˆS) = ˆt∈ ˆT ˆs∈ ˆS p(ˆt, ˆs)log p(ˆt, ˆs) p(ˆt)p(ˆs) , (2) where p(ˆt, ˆs) are estimated by the term frequency tf of Term Cluster ˆt and Segment ˆs in the training set D. Note that here a segment ˆs includes sentences about the the same topic among all documents.",
                "The optimal solution is the mapping Clut : T → ˆT, Segd : Sd → ˆS , and Alid : ˆS → ˆS, which maximizes I( ˆT; ˆS). 4.2 Weighted Mutual Information In topic segmentation and alignment of multiple documents, if P(D, ˆS, T) is known, based on the marginal distributions P(D|T) and P( ˆS|T) for each term t ∈ T, we can categorize terms into four types in the data set: • Common stop words are common both along the dimensions of documents and segments. • Document-dependent stop words that depends on the personal writing style are common only along the dimension of segments for some documents. • Cue words are the most important elements for segmentation.",
                "They are common along the dimension of documents only for the same segment, and they are not common along the dimensions of segments. • Noisy words are other words which are not common along both dimensions.",

                "Thus, the extension of topic segmentation from single documents to identifying similar segments from multiple similar documents with the same topic is a natural and necessary direction, and multi-document topic segmentation is expected to have a better performance since more information is utilized.",
                "Traditional approaches using similarity measurement based on term frequency generally have the same assumption that similar vocabulary tends to be in a coherent topic segment [15, 25, 6].",

                "However, often getting large training sets with manual labels on document sentences is prohibitively expensive, so unsupervised approaches are desired.",
                "Some models consider dependence between sentences and sections, such as Hidden Markov Model [3, 27], Maximum Entropy Markov Model [19], and Conditional Random Fields [17], while many other approaches are based on lexical cohesion or similarity of sentences [5, 6, 15, 25, 21].",
                "Some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11].",
                "While some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others utilize multiple documents [16, 14].",
                "There are not many works in the latter category, even though the performance of segmentation is expected to be better with utilization of information from multiple documents.",
                "Previous research studied methods to find shared topics [16] and topic segmentation and summarization between just a pair of documents [14].",
                "Text classification and clustering is a related research area which categorizes documents into groups using supervised or unsupervised methods.",
                "Topical classification or clustering is an important direction in this area, especially co-clustering of documents and terms, such as LSA [9], PLSA [13], and approaches based on distances and bipartite graph partitioning [28] or maximum MI [2, 10], or maximum entropy [1, 18].",

The term frequency can be used to estimate the joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T), which is p(t, d, s) = T(t, d, s)/ND, where T(t, d, s) is the number of t in ds sentence s and ND is the total number of terms in D. ˆS represents the set of segments {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} after segmentation and alignment among multiple documents, where the number of segments | ˆS| = p. A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic.",
                "The goal is to find the optimal topic segmentation and alignment mapping Segd(si) : {s1, s2, ..., snd } → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} and Alid(ˆsi) : {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp}, for all d ∈ D, where ˆsi is ith segment with the constraint that only adjacent sentences can be mapped to the same segment, i.e. for d, {si, si+1, ..., sj} → {ˆsq}, where q ∈ {1, ..., p}, where p is the segment number, and if i > j, then for d, ˆsq is missing.",
                "After segmentation and alignment, random vector Sd becomes an aligned random variable ˆS.",
                "Thus, P(D, Sd, T) becomes P(D, ˆS, T).",
                "Term co-clustering is a technique that has been employed [10] to improve the accuracy of document clustering.",

                "METHODOLOGY We now describe a novel algorithm which can handle singledocument segmentation, shared topic detection, and multidocument segmentation and alignment based on MI or WMI. 4.1 Mutual Information MI I(X; Y ) is a quantity to measure the amount of information which is contained in two or more random variables [8, 10].",

                "Thus, intuitively, the value of MI depends on how random variables are dependent on each other.",
                "The optimal co-clustering is the mapping Clux : X → ˆX and Cluy : Y → ˆY that minimizes the loss: I(X; Y ) − I( ˆX; ˆY ), which is equal to maximizing I( ˆX; ˆY ).",

                "In the case of topic segmentation, the two random variables are the term variable T and the segment variable S, and each sample is an occurrence of a term T = t in a particular segment S = s. I(T; S) is used to measure how dependent T and S are.",
                "However, I(T; S) cannot be computed for documents before segmentation, since we do not have a set of S due to the fact that sentences of Document d, si ∈ Sd, is not aligned with other documents.",
                "Thus, instead of minimizing the loss of MI, we can maximize MI after topic segmentation, computed as: I( ˆT; ˆS) = ˆt∈ ˆT ˆs∈ ˆS p(ˆt, ˆs)log p(ˆt, ˆs) p(ˆt)p(ˆs) , (2) where p(ˆt, ˆs) are estimated by the term frequency tf of Term Cluster ˆt and Segment ˆs in the training set D. Note that here a segment ˆs includes sentences about the the same topic among all documents.",

                "They are common along the dimension of documents only for the same segment, and they are not common along the dimensions of segments. • Noisy words are other words which are not common along both dimensions.",

                "To reinforce the contribution of cue words in the MI computation, and simultaneously reduce the effect of the other three types of words, similar as the idea of the tf-idf weight [22], we use entropies of each term along the dimensions of document D and segment ˆS, i.e.",

A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic.",
                "The goal is to find the optimal topic segmentation and alignment mapping Segd(si) : {s1, s2, ..., snd } → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} and Alid(ˆsi) : {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp}, for all d ∈ D, where ˆsi is ith segment with the constraint that only adjacent sentences can be mapped to the same segment, i.e. for d, {si, si+1, ..., sj} → {ˆsq}, where q ∈ {1, ..., p}, where p is the segment number, and if i > j, then for d, ˆsq is missing.",
                "After segmentation and alignment, random vector Sd becomes an aligned random variable ˆS.",

                "However, I(T; S) cannot be computed for documents before segmentation, since we do not have a set of S due to the fact that sentences of Document d, si ∈ Sd, is not aligned with other documents.",

Note that here a segment ˆs includes sentences about the the same topic among all documents.",

                "Supervised learning usually has good performance, since it learns functions from labelled training sets.",
                "However, often getting large training sets with manual labels on document sentences is prohibitively expensive, so unsupervised approaches are desired.",
                "Some models consider dependence between sentences and sections, such as Hidden Markov Model [3, 27], Maximum Entropy Markov Model [19], and Conditional Random Fields [17], while many other approaches are based on lexical cohesion or similarity of sentences [5, 6, 15, 25, 21].",
                "Some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11].",
                "While some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others utilize multiple documents [16, 14].",
                "There are not many works in the latter category, even though the performance of segmentation is expected to be better with utilization of information from multiple documents.",
                "Previous research studied methods to find shared topics [16] and topic segmentation and summarization between just a pair of documents [14].",
                "Text classification and clustering is a related research area which categorizes documents into groups using supervised or unsupervised methods.",
                "Topical classification or clustering is an important direction in this area, especially co-clustering of documents and terms, such as LSA [9], PLSA [13], and approaches based on distances and bipartite graph partitioning [28] or maximum MI [2, 10], or maximum entropy [1, 18].",
                "Criteria of these approaches can be utilized in the issue of topic segmentation.",
                "Some of those methods have been extended into the area of topic segmentation, such as PLSA [5] and maximum entropy [7], but to our best knowledge, using MI for topic segmentation has not been studied. 3.",

The term frequency can be used to estimate the joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T), which is p(t, d, s) = T(t, d, s)/ND, where T(t, d, s) is the number of t in ds sentence s and ND is the total number of terms in D. ˆS represents the set of segments {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} after segmentation and alignment among multiple documents, where the number of segments | ˆS| = p. A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic.",
                "The goal is to find the optimal topic segmentation and alignment mapping Segd(si) : {s1, s2, ..., snd } → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} and Alid(ˆsi) : {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp}, for all d ∈ D, where ˆsi is ith segment with the constraint that only adjacent sentences can be mapped to the same segment, i.e. for d, {si, si+1, ..., sj} → {ˆsq}, where q ∈ {1, ..., p}, where p is the segment number, and if i > j, then for d, ˆsq is missing.",
                "After segmentation and alignment, random vector Sd becomes an aligned random variable ˆS.",
                "Thus, P(D, Sd, T) becomes P(D, ˆS, T).",
                "Term co-clustering is a technique that has been employed [10] to improve the accuracy of document clustering.",

                "METHODOLOGY We now describe a novel algorithm which can handle singledocument segmentation, shared topic detection, and multidocument segmentation and alignment based on MI or WMI. 4.1 Mutual Information MI I(X; Y ) is a quantity to measure the amount of information which is contained in two or more random variables [8, 10].",

                "Thus, intuitively, the value of MI depends on how random variables are dependent on each other.",
                "The optimal co-clustering is the mapping Clux : X → ˆX and Cluy : Y → ˆY that minimizes the loss: I(X; Y ) − I( ˆX; ˆY ), which is equal to maximizing I( ˆX; ˆY ).",
                "This is the criterion of MI for clustering.",
                "In the case of topic segmentation, the two random variables are the term variable T and the segment variable S, and each sample is an occurrence of a term T = t in a particular segment S = s. I(T; S) is used to measure how dependent T and S are.",
                "However, I(T; S) cannot be computed for documents before segmentation, since we do not have a set of S due to the fact that sentences of Document d, si ∈ Sd, is not aligned with other documents.",
                "Thus, instead of minimizing the loss of MI, we can maximize MI after topic segmentation, computed as: I( ˆT; ˆS) = ˆt∈ ˆT ˆs∈ ˆS p(ˆt, ˆs)log p(ˆt, ˆs) p(ˆt)p(ˆs) , (2) where p(ˆt, ˆs) are estimated by the term frequency tf of Term Cluster ˆt and Segment ˆs in the training set D. Note that here a segment ˆs includes sentences about the the same topic among all documents.",
                "The optimal solution is the mapping Clut : T → ˆT, Segd : Sd → ˆS , and Alid : ˆS → ˆS, which maximizes I( ˆT; ˆS). 4.2 Weighted Mutual Information In topic segmentation and alignment of multiple documents, if P(D, ˆS, T) is known, based on the marginal distributions P(D|T) and P( ˆS|T) for each term t ∈ T, we can categorize terms into four types in the data set: • Common stop words are common both along the dimensions of documents and segments. • Document-dependent stop words that depends on the personal writing style are common only along the dimension of segments for some documents. • Cue words are the most important elements for segmentation.",
                "They are common along the dimension of documents only for the same segment, and they are not common along the dimensions of segments. • Noisy words are other words which are not common along both dimensions.",

                "To reinforce the contribution of cue words in the MI computation, and simultaneously reduce the effect of the other three types of words, similar as the idea of the tf-idf weight [22], we use entropies of each term along the dimensions of document D and segment ˆS, i.e.",

                "Some models consider dependence between sentences and sections, such as Hidden Markov Model [3, 27], Maximum Entropy Markov Model [19], and Conditional Random Fields [17], while many other approaches are based on lexical cohesion or similarity of sentences [5, 6, 15, 25, 21].",
                "Some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11].",
                "While some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others utilize multiple documents [16, 14].",
                "There are not many works in the latter category, even though the performance of segmentation is expected to be better with utilization of information from multiple documents.",

                "Topical classification or clustering is an important direction in this area, especially co-clustering of documents and terms, such as LSA [9], PLSA [13], and approaches based on distances and bipartite graph partitioning [28] or maximum MI [2, 10], or maximum entropy [1, 18].",

The term frequency can be used to estimate the joint probability distribution P(D, Sd, T), which is p(t, d, s) = T(t, d, s)/ND, where T(t, d, s) is the number of t in ds sentence s and ND is the total number of terms in D. ˆS represents the set of segments {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} after segmentation and alignment among multiple documents, where the number of segments | ˆS| = p. A segment ˆsi of document d is a sequence of adjacent sentences in d. Since for different documents si may discuss different sub-topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub-topic.",
                "The goal is to find the optimal topic segmentation and alignment mapping Segd(si) : {s1, s2, ..., snd } → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} and Alid(ˆsi) : {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp}, for all d ∈ D, where ˆsi is ith segment with the constraint that only adjacent sentences can be mapped to the same segment, i.e. for d, {si, si+1, ..., sj} → {ˆsq}, where q ∈ {1, ..., p}, where p is the segment number, and if i > j, then for d, ˆsq is missing.",
                "After segmentation and alignment, random vector Sd becomes an aligned random variable ˆS.",
                "Thus, P(D, Sd, T) becomes P(D, ˆS, T).",

                "However, I(T; S) cannot be computed for documents before segmentation, since we do not have a set of S due to the fact that sentences of Document d, si ∈ Sd, is not aligned with other documents.",
                "Thus, instead of minimizing the loss of MI, we can maximize MI after topic segmentation, computed as: I( ˆT; ˆS) = ˆt∈ ˆT ˆs∈ ˆS p(ˆt, ˆs)log p(ˆt, ˆs) p(ˆt)p(ˆs) , (2) where p(ˆt, ˆs) are estimated by the term frequency tf of Term Cluster ˆt and Segment ˆs in the training set D. Note that here a segment ˆs includes sentences about the the same topic among all documents.",
                "The optimal solution is the mapping Clut : T → ˆT, Segd : Sd → ˆS , and Alid : ˆS → ˆS, which maximizes I( ˆT; ˆS). 4.2 Weighted Mutual Information In topic segmentation and alignment of multiple documents, if P(D, ˆS, T) is known, based on the marginal distributions P(D|T) and P( ˆS|T) for each term t ∈ T, we can categorize terms into four types in the data set: • Common stop words are common both along the dimensions of documents and segments. • Document-dependent stop words that depends on the personal writing style are common only along the dimension of segments for some documents. • Cue words are the most important elements for segmentation.",
                "They are common along the dimension of documents only for the same segment, and they are not common along the dimensions of segments. • Noisy words are other words which are not common along both dimensions.",
