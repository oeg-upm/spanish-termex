In this paper the concept Shared Belief Map is proposed as a basis for developing realistic shared expectations among a team of Human-Agent-Pairs (HAPs). The establishment of shared belief maps relies on inter-agent information sharing, the effectiveness of which highly depends on agents processing loads and the instantaneous cognitive loads of their human partners. We investigate HMM-based cognitive load models to facilitate team members to share the right information with the right party at the right time. The shared belief map concept and the cognitive/processing load models have been implemented in a cognitive agent architectureSMMall. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the concept, the models, and their impacts on the evolving of shared mental models of HAP teams.

INTRODUCTION The entire movement of agent paradigm was spawned, at least in part, by the perceived importance of fostering human-like adjustable autonomy. Human-centered multiagent teamwork has thus attracted increasing attentions in multi-agent systems field [2, 10, 4]. Humans and autonomous systems (agents) are generally thought to be complementary: while humans are limited by their cognitive capacity in information processing, they are superior in spatial, heuristic, and analogical reasoning; autonomous systems can continuously learn expertise and tacit problem-solving knowledge from humans to improve system performance. In short, humans and agents can team together to achieve better performance, given that they could establish certain mutual awareness to coordinate their mixed-initiative activities. However, the foundation of human-agent collaboration keeps being challenged because of nonrealistic modeling of mutual awareness of the state of affairs. In particular, few researchers look beyond to assess the principles of modeling shared mental constructs between a human and his/her assisting agent. Moreover, human-agent relationships can go beyond partners to teams. Many informational processing limitations of individuals can be alleviated by having a group perform tasks. Although groups also can create additional costs centered on communication, resolution of conflict, and social acceptance, it is suggested that such limitations can be overcome if people have shared cognitive structures for interpreting task and social requirements [8]. Therefore, there is a clear demand for investigations to broaden and deepen our understanding on the principles of shared mental modeling among members of a mixed human-agent team. There are lines of research on multi-agent teamwork, both theoretically and empirically. For instance, Joint Intention [3] and SharedPlans [5] are two theoretical frameworks for specifying agent collaborations. One of the drawbacks is that, although both have a deep philosophical and cognitive root, they do not accommodate the modeling of human team members. Cognitive studies suggested that teams which have shared mental models are expected to have common expectations of the task and team, which allow them to predict the behavior and resource needs of team members more accurately [14, 6]. Cannon-Bowers et al. [14] explicitly argue that team members should hold compatible models that lead to common expectations. We agree on this and believe that the establishment of shared expectations among human and agent team members is a critical step to advance human-centered teamwork research. It has to be noted that the concept of shared expectation can broadly include role assignment and its dynamics, teamwork schemas and progresses, communication patterns and intentions, etc. While the long-term goal of our research is to understand how shared cognitive structures can enhance human-agent team performance, the specific objective of the work reported here is to develop a computational cognitive 395 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS capacity model to facilitate the establishment of shared expectations. In particular, we argue that to favor humanagent collaboration, an agent system should be designed to allow the estimation and prediction of human teammates (relative) cognitive loads, and use that to offer improvised, unintrusive help. Ideally, being able to predict the cognitive/processing capacity curves of teammates could allow a team member to help the right party at the right time, avoiding unbalanced work/cognitive loads among the team. The last point is on the modeling itself. Although an agents cognitive model of its human peer is not necessarily to be descriptively accurate, having at least a realistic model can be beneficial in offering unintrusive help, bias reduction, as well as trustable and self-adjustable autonomy. For example, although humans use of cognitive simplification mechanisms (e.g., heuristics) does not always lead to errors in judgment, it can lead to predictable biases in responses [8]. It is feasible to develop agents as cognitive aids to alleviate humans biases, as long as an agent can be trained to obtain a model of a humans cognitive inclination. With a realistic human cognitive model, an agent can also better adjust its automation level. When its human peer is becoming overloaded, an agent can take over resource-consuming tasks, shifting the humans limited cognitive resources to tasks where a humans role is indispensable. When its human peer is underloaded, an agent can take the chance to observe the humans operations to refine its cognitive model of the human. Many studies have documented that human choices and behaviors do not agree with predictions from rational models. If agents could make recommendations in ways that humans appreciate, it would be easier to establish trust relationships between agents and humans; this in turn, will encourage humans automation uses. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review cognitive load theories and measurements. A HMM-based cognitive load model is given in Section 3 to support resource-bounded teamwork among human-agentpairs. Section 4 describes the key concept shared belief map as implemented in SMMall, and Section 5 reports the experiments for evaluating the cognitive models and their impacts on the evolving of shared mental models. 2. COGNITIVE CAPACITY-OVERVIEW People are information processors. Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata. Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making. According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer. It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations. It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance. Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval. The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory. The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes. In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1]. Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information. Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance. This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists. Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12]. Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time. Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration. Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15]. From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7]. Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases. The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops. A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention. Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate. However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex. To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load. It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.

HUMAN-CENTERED TEAMWORK MODEL People are limited information processors, and so are intelligent agent systems; this is especially true when they act under hard or soft timing constraints imposed by the domain problems. In respect to our goal to build realistic expectations among teammates, we take two important steps. First, agents are resource-bounded; their processing capacity is limited by computing resources, inference knowledge, concurrent tasking capability, etc. We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates. Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored. Taking this approach will largely change the way in which an agent views (models) the involvement and cooperativeness of its teammates in a team activity. In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only. This being said, we are not dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable. We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities. Second, human teammates are bounded by their cognitive capacities. As far as we know, the research reported here is the first attempt in the area of humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers building and using humans cognitive load model to facilitate teamwork involving both humans and agents. We use Hi, Ai to denote Human-Agent-Pair (HAP) i. 3.1 Computational Cognitive Capacity Model An intelligent agent being a cognitive aid, it is desirable that the model of its human partner implemented within the agent is cognitively-acceptable, if not descriptively accurate. Of course, building a cognitive load model that is cognitively-acceptable is not trivial; there exist a variety of cognitive load theories and different measuring techniques. We here choose to focus on the performance variables of secondary tasks, given the ample evidence supporting secondary task performance as a highly sensitive and reliable technique for measuring humans cognitive load [12]. Its worth noting that just for the purpose of estimating a human subjects cognitive load, any artificial task (e.g, pressing a button in response to unpredictable stimuli) can be used as a secondary task to force the subject to go through. However, in a realistic application, we have to make sure that the selected secondary task interacts with the primary task in meaningful ways, which is not easy and often depends on the domain problem at hand. For example, in the experiment below, we used the number of newly available information correctly recalled as the secondary task, and the effective0 1 2 3 4 negligibly slightly fairly heavily overly 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.25 0.25 0.1 0.2 0.2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ≥ 9 B = 0 1 2 3 4 ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 0 0 0 0 0 0.02 0.03 0.05 0.1 0.8 0 0 0 0 0 0.05 0.05 0.1 0.7 0.1 0 0 0 0 0.01 0.02 0.45 0.4 0.1 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.05 0.15 0.4 0.3 0.03 0.02 0 0 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ Figure 2: A HMM Cognitive Load Model. ness of information sharing as the primary task. This is realistic to intelligence workers because in time stress situations they have to know what information to share in order to effectively establish an awareness of the global picture. In the following, we adopt the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach [13] to model humans cognitive capacity. It is thus assumed that at each time step the secondary task performance of a human subject in a team composed of human-agent-pairs (HAP) is observable to all the team members. Human team members secondary task performance is used for estimating their hidden cognitive loads. A HMM is denoted by λ = N, V, A, B, π , where N is a set of hidden states, V is a set of observation symbols, A is a set of state transition probability distributions, B is a set of observation symbol probability distributions (one for each hidden state), and π is the initial state distribution. We consider a 5-state HMM model of human cognitive load as follows (Figure 2). The hidden states are 0 (negligiblyloaded), 1 (slightly-loaded), 2 (fairly-loaded), 3 (heavilyloaded), and 4 (overly loaded). The observable states are tied with secondary task performance, which, in this study, is measured in terms of the number of items correctly recalled. According to Millers 7±2 rule, the observable states take integer values from 0 to 9 ( the state is 9 when the number of items correctly recalled is no less than 9). For the example B Matrix given in Fig. 2, it is very likely that the cognitive load of the subject is negligibly when the number of items correctly recalled is larger than 9. However, to determine the current hidden load status of a human partner is not trivial. The model might be oversensitive if we only consider the last-step secondary task performance to locate the most likely hidden state. There is ample evidence suggesting that human cognitive load is a continuous function over time and does not manifest sudden shifts unless there is a fundamental changes in tasking demands. To address this issue, we place a constraint on the state transition coefficients: no jumps of more than 2 states are allowed. In addition, we take the position that, a human subject is very likely overloaded if his secondary task performance is mostly low in recent time steps, while he is very likely not overloaded if his secondary task performance is mostly high recently. This leads to the following Windowed-HMM approach. Given a pre-trained HMM λ of human cognitive load and the recent observation sequence Ot of length w, let parameter w be the effective window size, ελ t be the estimated hidden state at time step t. First apply the HMM to the observation sequence to find the optimal sequence of hidden states Sλ t = s1s2 · · · sw (Viterbi algorithm). Then, compute the estimated hidden state ελ t for the current time step, viewing it as a function of Sλ t . We consider all the hidden states in Sλ t , weighted by their respective distance to ελ t−1 (the estimated state of the last step): the closer of a state in Sλ t The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 397 to ελ t−1, the higher probability of the state being ελ t . ελ t is set to be the state with the highest probability (note that a state may have multiple appearances in Sλ t ). More formally, the probability of state s ∈ S being ελ t is given by: pλ(s, t) = s=sj ∈Sλ t η(sj)e−|sj −ελ t−1| , (1) where η(sj) = ej / w k=1 ek is the weight of sj ∈ Sλ t (the most recent hidden state has the most significant influence in predicting the next state). The estimated state for the current step is the state with maximum likelihood: ελ t = argmax s∈Sλ t pλ(s, t) (2) 3.2 Agent Processing Load Model According to schema theory [11], multiple elements of information can be chunked as single elements in cognitive schemas. A schema can hold a huge amount of information, yet is processed as a single unit. We adapt this idea and assume that agent is estimation of agent js processing load at time step t is a function of two factors: the number of chunks cj(t) and the total number sj(t) of information being considered by agent j. If cj(t) and sj(t) are observable to agent i, agent i can employ a Windowed-HMM approach as described in Section 3.1 to model and estimate agent js instantaneous processing load. In the study reported below, we also used 5-state HMM models for agent processing load. With the 5 hidden states similar to the HMM models adopted for human cognitive load, we employed multivariate Gaussian observation probability distributions for the hidden states. 3.3 HAPs Processing Load Model As discussed above, a Human-Agent-Pair (HAP) is viewed as a unit when teaming up with other HAPs. The processing load of a HAP can thus be modeled as the co-effect of the processing load of the agent and the cognitive load of the human partner as captured by the agent. Suppose agent Ai has models for its processing load and its human partner His cognitive load. Denote the agent processing load and human cognitive load of HAP Hi, Ai at time step t by μi t and νi t, respectively. Agent Ai can use μi t and νi t to estimate the load of Hi, Ai as a whole. Similarly, if μj t and νj t are observable to agent Ai, it can estimate the load of Hj, Aj . For model simplicity, we still used 5-state HMM models for HAP processing load, with the estimated hidden states of the corresponding agent processing load and human cognitive load as the input observation vectors. Building a load estimation model is the means. The goal is to use the model to enhance information sharing performance so that a team can form better shared mental models (e.g., to develop inter-agent role expectations in their collaboration), which is the key to high team performance. 3.4 Load-Sensitive Information Processing Each agent has to adopt a certain strategy to process the incoming information. As far as resource-bounded agents are concerned, it is of no use for an agent to share information with teammates who are already overloaded; they simply do not have the capacity to process the information. Consider the incoming information processing strategy as shown in Table 1. Agent Ai (of HAPi) ignores all the incoming information when it is overloaded, and processes all the incoming information when it is negligibly loaded. When it Table 1: Incoming information processing strategy HAPi Load Strategy Overly Ignore all shared info Heavily Consider every teammate A ∈ [1, 1 q |Q| ], randomly process half amount of info from A; Ignore info from any teammate B ∈ ( 1 q |Q|, |Q|] Fairly Process half of shared info from any teammate Slightly Process all info from any A ∈ [1, 1 q |Q| ]; For any teammate B ∈ ( 1 q |Q|, |Q|] randomly process half amount of info from B Negligibly Process all shared info HAPj Process all info from HAPj if it is overloaded *Q is a FIFO queue of agents from whom this HAP has received information at the current step; q is a constant known to all. is heavily loaded, Ai randomly processes half of the messages from those agents which are the first 1/q teammates appeared in its communication queue; when it is fairly loaded, Ai randomly processes half of the messages from any teammates; when it is slightly loaded, Ai processes all the messages from those agents which are the first 1/q teammates appeared in its communication queue, and randomly processes half of the messages from other teammates. To further encourage sharing information at the right time, the last row of Table 1 says that HAPi , if having not sent information to HAPj who is currently overloaded, will process all the information from HAPj . This can be justified from resource allocation perspective: an agent can reallocate its computing resource reserved for communication to enhance its capacity of processing information. This strategy favors never sending information to an overloaded teammate, and it suggests that estimating and exploiting others loads can be critical to enable an agent to share the right information with the right party at the right time. 4. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION SMMall (Shared Mental Models for all) is a cognitive agent architecture developed for supporting human-centric collaborative computing. It stresses humans role in team activities by means of novel collaborative concepts and multiple representations of context woven through all aspects of team work. Here we describe two components pertinent to the experiment reported in Section 5: multi-party communication and shared mental maps (a complete description of the SMMall system is beyond the scope of this paper). 4.1 Multi-Party Communication Multi-party communication refers to conversations involving more than two parties. Aside from the speaker, the listeners involved in a conversation can be classified into various roles such as addressees (the direct listeners), auditors (the intended listeners), overhearers (the unintended but anticipated listeners), and eavesdroppers (the unanticipated listeners). Multi-party communication is one of the characteristics of human teams. SMMall agents, which can form Human-Agent-Pairs with human partners, support multiparty communication with the following features. 1. SMMall supports a collection of multi-party performatives such as MInform (multi-party inform), MAnnounce (multi-party announce), and MAsk (multi-party ask). The listeners of a multi-party performative can be addressees, auditors, and overhearers, which correspond to to, cc, and bcc in e-mail terms, respectively. 2. SMMall supports channelled-communication. There 398 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) are three built-in channels: agentTalk channel (inter-agent activity-specific communication), control channel (meta communication for team coordination), and world channel (communication with the external world). An agent can fully tune to a channel to collect messages sent (or cc, bcc) to it. An agent can also partially tune to a channel to get statistic information about the messages communicated over the channel. This is particularly useful if an agent wants to know the communication load imposed on a teammate. 4.2 Shared Belief Map & Load Display A concept shared belief map has been proposed and implemented into SMMall; this responds to the need to seek innovative perspectives or concepts that allow group members to effectively represent and reason about shared mental models at different levels of abstraction. As described in Section 5, humans and agents interacted through shared belief maps in the evaluation of HMM-based load models. A shared belief map is a table with color-coded info-cellscells associated with information. Each row captures the belief model of one team member, and each column corresponds to a specific information type (all columns together define the boundary of the information space being considered). Thus, info-cell Cij of a map encodes all the beliefs (instances) of information type j held by agent i. Color coding applies to each info-cell to indicate the number of information instances held by the corresponding agent. The concept of shared belief map helps maintain and present a human partner with a synergy view of the shared mental models evolving within a team. Briefly, SMMall has implemented the concept with the following features: 1. A context menu can be popped up for each info-cell to view and share the associated information instances. It allows selective (selected subset) or holistic info-sharing. 2. Mixed-initiative info-sharing: both agents and human partners can initiate a multi-party conversation. It also allows third-party info-sharing, say, A shares the information held by B with C. 3. Information types that are semantically related (e.g., by inference rules) can be closely organized. Hence, nearby info-cells can form meaningful plateaus (or contour lines) of similar colors. Colored plateaus indicate those sections of a shared mental model that bear high overlapping degrees. 4. The perceptible color (hue) difference manifested from a shared belief map indicates the information difference among team members, and hence visually represents the potential information needs of each team member (See Figure 3). SMMall has also implemented the HMM-based models (Section 3) to allow an agent to estimate its human partners and other team members cognitive/processing loads. As shown in Fig. 3, below the shared belief map there is a load display for each team member. There are 2 curves in a display: the blue (dark) one plots humans instantaneous cognitive loads and the red one plots the processing loads of a HAP as a whole. If there are n team members, each agent needs to maintain 2n HMM-based models to support the load displays. The human partner of a HAP can adjust her cognitive load at runtime, as well as monitor another HAPs agent processing load and its probability of processing the information she sends at the current time step. Thus, the more closely a HAP can estimate the actual processing loads of other HAPs, the better information sharing performance the HAP can achieve. Figure 3: Shared Mental Map Display In sum, shared belief maps allow the inference of who needs what, and load displays allow the judgment of when to share information. Together they allow us to investigate the impact of sharing the right info. with the right party at the right time on the evolving of shared mental models. 4.3 Metrics for Shared Mental Models We here describe how we measure team performance in our experiment. We use mental model overlapping percentage (MMOP) as the base to measure shared mental models. MMOP of a group is defined as the intersection of all the individual mental states relative to the union of individual mental states of the group. Formally, given a group of k agents G = {Ai|1 ≤ i ≤ k}, let Bi = {Iim|1 ≤ m ≤ n} be the beliefs (information) held by agent Ai, where each Iim is a set of information of the same type, and n (the size of information space) is fixed for the agents in G, then MMOP(G) = 100 n 1≤m≤n ( | ∩1≤i≤k Iim| | ∪1≤i≤k Iim| ). (3) First, a shared mental model can be measured in terms of the distance of averaged subgroup MMOPs to the MMOP of the whole group. Without losing generality, we define paired SMM distance (subgroups of size 2) D2 as: D2 (G) = 1≤i<j≤k (MMOP({Ai, Aj}) − MMOP(G))2 . (4) The MMOP of a subgroup is always larger than the MMOP of the whole group. Intuitively, the larger distance from the MMOP of a subgroup to that of the whole group, the more overlapping mental models the subgroup shares. This notion can be used to measure the tightness of an emerging subgroup or guide the process of team coalition. Second, due to communication or information processing limits, each individuals subjective measure of the groups MMOP can be very different from the groups MMOP measured objectively from external. A shared mental model can thus be measured in terms of the closeness of individuals measure of the groups MMOP to the objective measure. Let MMOP(G) and M MOPi(G) be the objective measure and agent Ais subjective measure of the groups shared mental models, respectively. We define SMM deviation D⊥ as: D⊥(G) = 1≤i≤k (MMOPi(G) − MMOP(G))2 . (5) Obviously, D⊥ measures the coherency of the whole group: the smaller the better. Third, shared mental models evolve over time. A shared mental model can be measured in terms of the stableness of the instantaneous measures of MMOP, D , or D⊥ The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 399 over time. High performing teams can often maintain their shared mental models such that the MMOP is stable at an acceptable level as activities proceed, while the MMOP measure of the shared mental models of a low-performing teams can fluctuate or decrease notably over time. 5. EXPERIMENT EVALUATION In this section we describe the experiments conducted to evaluate the load estimation models and the shared belief map concept for developing team shared mental models. 5.1 Problem Description The members of a HAP team (i.e., a team composed of Human-Agent-Pairs) are situated in a dynamic environment. Due to their different (maybe overlapping) observability, at each time step they may get different situational information. The goal of a HAP team is to selectively share information in a timely manner to develop global situation awareness (say, for making critical decisions). Each run of the experiment has 45 time steps; each time step lasts 15 seconds. A time step starts with certain infocells of the shared belief map being flashed quickly (for 2 s). The flashed cells are exactly those with newly available information that should be shared at that time step. An info-cell is frozen at the end of a time step: the associated information is no longer sharable. This requires that the newly available information be shared in time, not later. The human and agent of a HAP assume different roles. An agent governs group communication and processes messages to update the shared belief map on its display. An agent, with a pre-trained HMM-based cognitive load model for its human partner and a processing load model for each of the other HAPs in the team, also estimates and displays their instantaneous loads. Human subjects need to perform a primary task and a secondary task. The secondary task of a human subject is to remember and mark the cells being flashed (not necessarily in the exact order) by left mouse clicks. Secondary task performance at step t is thus measured as the number of cells marked (remembered) correctly at t, which is taken as the observable state of the HMMbased cognitive load model of that human subject. The primary task of a human subject is to build a shared mental model of the dynamic situation by sharing the right information with the right party at the right time. To share the information associated with an info-cell, a human subject needs to click the right mouse button on the cell, and select the receiving teammate(s) from the popup menu. There are costs associated with information sharing. Communications among HAPs is done by the corresponding SMMall agents, which have both limited capacity nin for processing incoming information and limited outgoing communication capacity nout. Thus, depending on the current HAP load, an agent may randomly ignore part or all of the incoming information (having no effect on the establishment of shared mental models). On the other hand, each time step at most nout number of information-sharing commands can be effective; more than that contribute nothing to the establishment of shared mental models. Sending information to an overloaded teammate will waste the capacity that otherwise can be used to share information with a less loaded teammate. This means that at each time step a human subject has to carefully go through three cognitive decisions: whether the information under consideration needs to be shared (i.e., whether it is associated with an info-cell just flashed), whether a team member is the right party to share the information with (i.e., whether it really needs the information), and whether this is the right time to share (i.e., whether the team member is currently overloaded). The above description applies to HAP teams. For teams composed of SMMall agents only, the agents will take all the roles played by an agent or a human partner in HAP teams. 5.2 Experiment Design To investigate the impacts of the HMM-based load models on the evolution of shared mental models (SMM), we conducted experiments for both Agent teams and HAP teams, where agent teams involve agent processing load models only, HAP teams involve models of HAP processing load (i.e., the co-effect of agent processing load and human cognitive load). To get insights on how load predictions and multi-party communication may affect the performance of forming SMM, we designed 3 Agent teams (TA1, TA2, TA3) and 3 HAP teams (TH1, TH2, TH3), where all agents adopt the strategy in Table 1 to send and process information. When sharing information, teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) ignore load predictions; teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2) consider load predictions; teams of type 3 (TA3, TH3) follow load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents will further group the receivers of a multi-party message (MInform) by their loads and split the message into multiple messages with their receivers having the same load. For example, given that agents A1, A2, A3 have load 1, 2, 1, respectively. An agent A0 in a team of TA2 may send one multi-party message, while an agent A0 in a team of TA3 will send two messages (one to A2, one to A1 and A3). In addition, we controlled agents outgoing communication capacities by varying from 6, 8, to 10. Due to constraints on communication capacity and processing capacity, an agent can be inaccurate when tracking other teammates mental models. In order to measure the actual shared mental models, a special SMMall agent named OmniAll was added to each team to monitor inter-agent communications and record the actual effects of information sharing on each agents mental model. This realizes a way, as suggested by Klimoski [6], to measuring the degree of overlap in immediate, intermediate, and long-term situation awareness zones held by group members. We also recorded instantaneous information sharing utility, which is defined as follows. At each time step, let T = T0, T1, T2, T3, T4 be a sequence of sets, where T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4 are sets of teammates whose current load states are negligibly, slightly, fairly, heavily, and overly respectively. Let S be the set of information-sharing commands issued by a human partner at the current step. Let Mi = {Tk ∈ T|k ≤ i, Tk = ∅}. Instantaneous info-sharing utility is defined as c∈S s value(c)/|S|, where s value(c) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 0 receiver(c) ∈ T4 0 c is known to receiver(c) 1/|Mi| receiver(c) ∈ Ti, i = 4 (6) In sum, this study involved 18 types of teams, each team had 4 members, and each team type was tested by 10 domain scenarios. 30 human subjects were recruited for HAP teams. The experiment results are plotted in Figures 4, 6, and 7. We next present our findings in this study. 5.3 Load Estimation Betters Info-sharing 400 The Sixth Intl.

First look at the performance of HAP teams in Fig. 4, we have: (1) For each team type, the performance (percentage of SMM overtime) averaged over 10 teams increased as communication capacity increased (TH1-6<TH18<TH1-10, TH2-6<TH2-8<TH2-10). (2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased. This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger. From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams. In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps. However, to maintain a SMM steadily at a certain level is a non-trivial team task. The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads). As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased. These also hold for the Agent teams (upper one in Fig. 4). Actually, the performance of type 3 (a) (b) A B C MInform I A B C Inform I Inform I Inform I Figure 5: Multi-party messages. agent teams was even worse (for each fixed capacity) than the performance of type 1 agent teams. This can be explained by the difference of two-party and multi-party communications. In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team members mental model (beliefs). According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs. Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models. As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver). However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts). Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case). However, splitting multi-party messages by receivers loads does enhance subgroup SMMs. In Fig. 6 we plotted the other two measures of SMMs (distance and closeness as defined in Sec. 4.3). For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team). Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of other types. For agent teams, TH3>TH1>TH2 holds in Fig. 6(a), and TH2<TH3<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(b). Thus, agent teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had much higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of type 1 (although slightly worse than team type 2). Hence, generally, multi-party communication encourages the forming/evolving of team SMMs. When a group of agents can be partitioned into subteams, splitting messages by their loads can be more effective for subteam SMMs. 5.5 The HMM-based Cognitive Model To validate the HMM-based cognitive load model is extremely difficult because detecting the real, noise-resistant cognitive load of human beings is far beyond the current technology. As an indirect judgment, we plotted the regression fitted lines for the means of information sharing utility of HAP teams with and without load displays. For the HAP teams with load displays there is a strong negative linear relationship between info-sharing utility and cognitive load levels (Pearson correlation coefficient is − √ 0.899 = −0.948 with P-Value = 0.014). Because the info-sharing utility measure and the cognitive load measure are indicators of primary task performance and secondary task performance, respectively, their linear relationship complies with cognitive studies that secondary task performance can be used The Sixth Intl.

However, for teams without load displays there is a strong quadratic rather than linear relationship (correlation coefficient is √ 0.974 = 0.987 with P-Value = 0.015). This indicates that the information sharing performance of a HAP team can be significantly affected by both the human subjects own cognitive load, and the awareness of other team members load. Knowing of others load (by estimation) will reduce the quadratic relation to a linear relation. Figure 7: Info-sharing utility by cognitive loads. 6. CONCLUSION Recent research attention on human-centered teamwork highly demands the design of agent systems as cognitive aids that can model and exploit human partners cognitive capacities to offer help unintrusively. In this paper, we investigated several factors surrounding the challenging problem of evolving shared mental models of teams composed of human-agent-pairs. The major contribution of this research includes (1) HMM-based load models were proposed for an agent to estimate its human partners cognitive load and other HAP teammates processing loads; (2) The shared belief map concept was introduced and implemented. It allows group members to effectively represent and reason about shared mental models; (3) Experiments were conducted to evaluate the HMM-based cognitive/processing load models and the impacts of multi-party communication on the evolving of team SMMs. The usefulness of shared belief maps was also demonstrated during the experiments. 7.

En este artículo, el mapa de creencias de concepto compartido se propone como base para desarrollar expectativas compartidas realistas entre un equipo de pares de agentes humanos (HAPS). El establecimiento de mapas de creencias compartidos se basa en el intercambio de información entre agentes, cuya efectividad depende en gran medida de las cargas de procesamiento de agentes y las cargas cognitivas instantáneas de sus parejas humanas. Investigamos los modelos de carga cognitiva basados en HMM para facilitar a los miembros del equipo compartir la información correcta con la parte correcta en el momento correcto. El concepto de mapa de creencias compartido y los modelos de carga cognitiva/de procesamiento se han implementado en un agente cognitivo Architecturesmall. Se realizaron una serie de experimentos para evaluar el concepto, los modelos y sus impactos en la evolución de los modelos mentales compartidos de equipos HAP. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos I.2.11 [Inteligencia artificial]: Agentes distribuidos de inteligencia artificial-inteligente, sistemas multiagentes Términos generales Diseño, experimentación, factores humanos 1. Introducción Todo el movimiento del paradigma del agente fue generado, al menos en parte, por la importancia percibida de fomentar la autonomía ajustable de tipo humano. El trabajo en equipo multiagente centrado en el ser humano ha atraído la creciente atenciones en el campo de sistemas de múltiples agentes [2, 10, 4]. Generalmente se cree que los humanos y los sistemas autónomos (agentes) son complementarios: mientras que los humanos están limitados por su capacidad cognitiva en el procesamiento de la información, son superiores en el razonamiento espacial, heurístico y analógico;Los sistemas autónomos pueden aprender continuamente experiencia y tácito que la resolución de problemas de los humanos para mejorar el rendimiento del sistema. En resumen, los humanos y los agentes pueden unirse para lograr un mejor rendimiento, dado que podrían establecer cierta conciencia mutua para coordinar sus actividades de inicio mixto. Sin embargo, la base de la colaboración de agentes humanos sigue siendo desafiado debido al modelado no realista de la conciencia mutua del estado de las cosas. En particular, pocos investigadores miran más allá para evaluar los principios del modelado de construcciones mentales compartidas entre un humano y su agente asistente. Además, las relaciones humanas-agentes pueden ir más allá de los socios de los equipos. Muchas limitaciones de procesamiento informativo de las personas pueden aliviarse haciendo que un grupo realice tareas. Aunque los grupos también pueden crear costos adicionales centrados en la comunicación, la resolución del conflicto y la aceptación social, se sugiere que tales limitaciones se pueden superar si las personas han compartido estructuras cognitivas para interpretar las tareas y los requisitos sociales [8]. Por lo tanto, existe una clara demanda de investigaciones para ampliar y profundizar nuestra comprensión sobre los principios del modelado mental compartido entre los miembros de un equipo mixto de agente humano. Hay líneas de investigación sobre trabajo en equipo de múltiples agentes, tanto teórico como empíricamente. Por ejemplo, la intención conjunta [3] y las planificaciones compartidas [5] son dos marcos teóricos para especificar colaboraciones de agentes. Uno de los inconvenientes es que, aunque ambos tienen una raíz filosófica y cognitiva profunda, no acomodan el modelado de los miembros del equipo humano. Los estudios cognitivos sugirieron que se espera que los equipos que han compartido modelos mentales tengan expectativas comunes de la tarea y el equipo, que les permiten predecir el comportamiento y las necesidades de recursos de los miembros del equipo con mayor precisión [14, 6]. Cannon-Bowers et al.[14] Argumenta explícitamente que los miembros del equipo deben tener modelos compatibles que conduzcan a expectativas comunes. Estamos de acuerdo en esto y creemos que el establecimiento de expectativas compartidas entre los miembros del equipo humano y de agentes es un paso crítico para avanzar en la investigación de trabajo en equipo centrado en el humano. Cabe señalar que el concepto de expectativa compartida puede incluir ampliamente la asignación de roles y su dinámica, esquemas de trabajo en equipo y progresos, patrones e intenciones de comunicación, etc. Si bien el objetivo a largo plazo de nuestra investigación es comprender cómo las estructuras cognitivas compartidas pueden mejorar el rendimiento del equipo de agentes humanos, el objetivo específico del trabajo informado aquí es desarrollar un cognitivo computacional 395 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS (RPS (RPS) c 2007 Modelo de capacidad Ifaamas para facilitar el establecimiento de expectativas compartidas. En particular, argumentamos que para favorecer la colaboración humanagente, se debe diseñar un sistema de agentes para permitir la estimación y la predicción de las cargas cognitivas (relativas) de compañeros humanos (relativos), y usarlo para ofrecer ayuda improvisada y poco intrusiva. Idealmente, poder predecir las curvas de capacidad cognitiva/de procesamiento de los compañeros de equipo podría permitir que un miembro del equipo ayude a la parte correcta en el momento adecuado, evitando las cargas de trabajo/cognitivas desequilibradas entre el equipo. El último punto está en el modelado en sí. Aunque un modelo cognitivo de los agentes de su compañero humano no es necesariamente ser descriptivamente preciso, tener al menos un modelo realista puede ser beneficioso para ofrecer ayuda inadecuada, reducción de sesgos, así como una autonomía confiable y autojustable. Por ejemplo, aunque el uso de los humanos de los mecanismos de simplificación cognitiva (por ejemplo, heurística) no siempre conduce a errores en el juicio, puede conducir a sesgos predecibles en las respuestas [8]. Es factible desarrollar a los agentes como ayudas cognitivas para aliviar los prejuicios humanos, siempre que un agente pueda ser entrenado para obtener un modelo de inclinación cognitiva de los humanos. Con un modelo cognitivo humano realista, un agente también puede ajustar mejor su nivel de automatización. Cuando su compañero humano se está sobrecargando, un agente puede hacerse cargo de las tareas que consumen recursos, cambiando los humanos limitados recursos cognitivos a tareas donde un rol de humanos es indispensable. Cuando su compañero humano está subcargado, un agente puede aprovechar la oportunidad de observar las operaciones de los humanos para refinar su modelo cognitivo del humano. Muchos estudios han documentado que las elecciones y los comportamientos humanos no están de acuerdo con las predicciones de los modelos racionales. Si los agentes pudieran hacer recomendaciones de manera que los humanos aprecian, sería más fácil establecer relaciones de confianza entre agentes y humanos;Esto a su vez, alentará los usos de automatización humanos. El resto del documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 revisamos teorías y mediciones de carga cognitiva. En la Sección 3 se proporciona un modelo de carga cognitiva basado en HMM para apoyar el trabajo en equipo limitado por los recursos entre los agentes humanos. La Sección 4 describe el concepto clave del mapa de creencias compartido como se implementa en SMMall, y la Sección 5 informa los experimentos para evaluar los modelos cognitivos y sus impactos en la evolución de los modelos mentales compartidos.2. Las personas cognitivas de la capacidad de la capacidad y la revisión son procesadores de información. La mayoría de los científicos cognitivos [8] creen que el sistema de procesamiento de información humana consiste en un componente ejecutivo y tres tiendas de información principales: (a) tienda sensorial, que recibe y conserva información por un segundo más o menos;(b) Memoria de trabajo (o a corto plazo), que se refiere a la capacidad limitada de tener (aproximadamente siete elementos en cualquier momento [9]), retener (durante varios segundos) y manipular (dos o tres elementos de información simultáneamente) información;y (c) memoria a largo plazo, que tiene una capacidad prácticamente ilimitada [1] y contiene una gran cantidad de conocimiento acumulado organizado como esquemas. Los estudios de carga cognitiva están, en general, preocupados por la capacidad de la memoria de trabajo y cómo eludir sus limitaciones en las actividades de resolución de problemas humanos, como el aprendizaje y la toma de decisiones. Según la teoría de la carga cognitiva [11], la carga cognitiva se define como una construcción multidimensional que representa la carga que una tarea particular impone al intérprete. Tiene una dimensión causal que incluye factores causales que pueden ser características del sujeto (por ejemplo, nivel de experiencia), la tarea (por ejemplo, complejidad de la tarea, presión de tiempo), el entorno (por ejemplo, ruido) y sus relaciones mutuas. También tiene una dimensión de evaluación que refleja los conceptos medibles de carga mental (impuesta exclusivamente por la tarea y las demandas ambientales), el esfuerzo mental (la capacidad cognitiva realmente asignada a la tarea) y el rendimiento. El modelo de procesamiento de información de Langs [7] consta de tres procesos principales: codificación, almacenamiento y recuperación. El proceso de codificación mapea selectivamente mensajes en tiendas sensoriales que son relevantes para los objetivos de una persona en la memoria de trabajo;El proceso de almacenamiento consolida la información recién codificada en fragmentos y formar asociaciones y esquemas para facilitar los retiros posteriores;El proceso de recuperación busca en la red de memoria asociada un elemento/esquema específico y la reactiva en la memoria de trabajo. El modelo sugiere que los recursos de procesamiento (capacidad cognitiva) se asignan independientemente a los tres procesos. Además, la memoria de trabajo se usa tanto para la retención como para el procesamiento de la información [1]. Debido a la capacidad limitada, cuando se requiere un mayor esfuerzo para procesar información, queda menos capacidad para el almacenamiento de información. Por lo tanto, la asignación de los recursos cognitivos limitados debe equilibrarse para mejorar el rendimiento humano. Esto llega al tema de medir la carga cognitiva, que ha resultado difícil para los científicos cognitivos. La carga cognitiva se puede evaluar midiendo la carga mental, el esfuerzo mental y el rendimiento utilizando escalas de calificación, psicofisiológicos (por ejemplo, medidas de actividad cardíaca, actividad cerebral, actividad ocular) y técnicas de tareas secundarias [12]. Los autosuficientes pueden parecer cuestionables y restringidas, especialmente cuando la carga instantánea debe medirse con el tiempo. Aunque las medidas fisiológicas a veces son altamente sensibles para rastrear los niveles fluctuantes de carga cognitiva, los costos y las condiciones de trabajo a menudo favorecen las técnicas basadas en la tarea y el rendimiento, que implican la medida de una tarea secundaria, así como la tarea principal en consideración. Las técnicas de tarea secundaria se basan en el supuesto de que el rendimiento en una tarea secundaria refleja el nivel de carga cognitiva impuesta por una tarea primaria [15]. Desde la perspectiva de asignación de recursos, suponiendo una capacidad cognitiva fija, cualquier aumento de los recursos cognitivos requeridos por la tarea principal debe disminuir inevitablemente los recursos disponibles para la tarea secundaria [7]. En consecuencia, el rendimiento en una tarea secundaria se deteriora a medida que aumenta la dificultad o la prioridad de la tarea principal. El nivel de carga cognitiva se puede manifestar por el rendimiento de la tarea secundaria: el sujeto se está sobrecargando si el rendimiento de la tarea secundaria cae. Una tarea secundaria puede ser tan simple como detectar una señal visual o auditiva, pero requiere atención sostenida. Su rendimiento se puede medir en términos de tiempo de reacción, precisión y tasa de error. Sin embargo, un inconveniente importante del rendimiento de la tarea secundaria, como señaló PAAS [12], es que puede interferir considerablemente con la tarea principal (competir por una capacidad limitada), especialmente cuando la tarea principal es compleja. Para comprender y medir mejor la carga cognitiva, XIE y Salvendy [16] introdujeron un marco conceptual, que distingue la carga instantánea, la carga máxima, la carga acumulada, la carga promedio y la carga general. Parece que la notación de carga instantánea, que representa la dinámica de la carga cognitiva a lo largo del tiempo, es especialmente útil para monitorear la tendencia de fluctuación para que la capacidad libre pueda explotarse en el momento más apropiado para mejorar el rendimiento general en las colaboraciones de agentes humanos.396 El sexto intl.

Las personas con el modelo de trabajo en equipo centrado en el ser humano son procesadores de información limitados, y también lo son los sistemas de agentes inteligentes;Esto es especialmente cierto cuando actúan bajo restricciones de tiempo duro o suave impuestas por los problemas de dominio. Con respecto a nuestro objetivo de desarrollar expectativas realistas entre los compañeros de equipo, tomamos dos pasos importantes. Primero, los agentes están vinculados a los recursos;Su capacidad de procesamiento está limitada por la computación de los recursos, el conocimiento de la inferencia, la capacidad de tareas concurrentes, etc. Retiraremos la suposición de que un agente conoce toda la información/intenciones comunicadas de otros compañeros de equipo. En cambio, sostenemos que debido a la capacidad de procesamiento limitada, un agente solo puede tener oportunidades para procesar (dar sentido) una parte de la información entrante, con el resto ignorado. Tomar este enfoque cambiará en gran medida la forma en que un agente ve (modelos) la participación y la cooperación de sus compañeros de equipo en una actividad de equipo. En otras palabras, el establecimiento de modelos mentales compartidos con respecto a las creencias, intenciones y responsabilidades de los miembros del equipo ya no puede confiar solo en la comunicación entre agentes. Dicho esto, no estamos dejando caer la suposición de que los compañeros de equipo son confiables. Todavía nos apeguamos a esto, solo que los miembros del equipo no pueden sobrefirmar entre sí;Un agente debe considerar la posibilidad de que su información compartida con otros no sea tan efectiva como se esperaba debido a las capacidades de procesamiento limitadas de los receptores. En segundo lugar, los compañeros de equipo humanos están limitados por sus capacidades cognitivas. Hasta donde sabemos, la investigación informada aquí es el primer intento en el área de trabajo en equipo de múltiples agentes humanes que realmente considera la construcción y el uso del modelo de carga cognitiva humanos para facilitar el trabajo en equipo que involucra a humanos y agentes. Usamos HI, AI para denotar el par de agentes humanos (hap) i.3.1 Modelo de capacidad cognitiva computacional Un agente inteligente que es una ayuda cognitiva, es deseable que el modelo de su socio humano implementado dentro del agente sea cognitivamente aceptable, si no descriptivamente exacto. Por supuesto, construir un modelo de carga cognitiva que sea cognitivamente aceptable no es trivial;Existen una variedad de teorías de carga cognitiva y diferentes técnicas de medición. Aquí elegimos centrarnos en las variables de rendimiento de las tareas secundarias, dada la amplia evidencia que respalda el rendimiento de las tareas secundarias como una técnica altamente sensible y confiable para medir la carga cognitiva de los humanos [12]. Vale la pena señalar que solo con el fin de estimar una carga cognitiva de sujetos humanos, cualquier tarea artificial (por ejemplo, presionar un botón en respuesta a estímulos impredecibles) puede usarse como una tarea secundaria para forzar el sujeto a pasar. Sin embargo, en una aplicación realista, debemos asegurarnos de que la tarea secundaria seleccionada interactúe con la tarea principal de manera significativa, lo que no es fácil y a menudo depende del problema del dominio en cuestión. Por ejemplo, en el siguiente experimento, utilizamos el número de información recién disponible recordada correctamente como la tarea secundaria, y la efectiva 0 1 2 3 4 de manera negligente ligeramente bastante fuerte 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.25.25 0.250.25 0.1 0.2 0.2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ≥ 9 B = 0 1 2 3 4 4 ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 0 0 0 0 0 0.02 0.03 0.05 0.1 0.8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.05 0.05 0.1 0.7 0.1 0 0 00 0 0.01 0.02 0.45 0.4 0.1 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.05 0.15 0.4 0.3 0.03 0.02 0 0 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ Figura 2: A HMM Modelo de carga cognitiva.Ness del intercambio de información como la tarea principal. Esto es realista para los trabajadores de inteligencia porque, en el tiempo, las situaciones de estrés tienen que saber qué información compartir para establecer efectivamente una conciencia de la imagen global. A continuación, adoptamos el enfoque del modelo de Markov oculto (HMM) [13] para modelar la capacidad cognitiva de los humanos. Por lo tanto, se supone que en cada paso el paso de la tarea secundaria de un sujeto humano en un equipo compuesto por pares de agentes humanos (HAP) es observable para todos los miembros del equipo. El rendimiento de la tarea secundaria de los miembros del equipo humano se utiliza para estimar sus cargas cognitivas ocultas. Un hmm se denota por λ = n, v, a, b, π, donde n es un conjunto de estados ocultos, V es un conjunto de símbolos de observación, A es un conjunto de distribuciones de probabilidad de transición de estado, B es un conjunto de observaciónDistribuciones de probabilidad del símbolo (una para cada estado oculto), y π es la distribución del estado inicial. Consideramos un modelo HMM de 5 estados de carga cognitiva humana de la siguiente manera (Figura 2). Los estados ocultos son 0 (cargados negligiblemente), 1 (ligeramente cargados), 2 (bastante cargados), 3 (con gran carga) y 4 (demasiado cargado). Los estados observables están vinculados con el rendimiento de la tarea secundaria, que, en este estudio, se mide en términos del número de elementos recordados correctamente. Según la regla Millers 7 ± 2, los estados observables toman valores enteros de 0 a 9 (el estado es 9 cuando el número de elementos retirados correctamente no es menos de 9). Para la matriz de Ejemplo B dada en la Fig. 2, es muy probable que la carga cognitiva del sujeto sea negligentemente cuando el número de elementos retirados correctamente es mayor que 9. Sin embargo, determinar el estado de carga oculta actual de una pareja humana no es trivial. El modelo podría ser demasiado sensible si solo consideramos el rendimiento de la tarea secundaria de los últimos pasos para ubicar el estado oculto más probable. Hay amplia evidencia que sugiere que la carga cognitiva humana es una función continua con el tiempo y no manifiesta cambios repentinos a menos que haya cambios fundamentales en las demandas de tareas. Para abordar este problema, colocamos una restricción en los coeficientes de transición del estado: no se permiten saltos de más de 2 estados. Además, tomamos la posición de que un sujeto humano está sobrecargado si su rendimiento secundario de la tarea es en su mayoría bajo en los pasos de tiempo recientes, mientras que es muy probable que no esté sobrecargado si su rendimiento de tarea secundaria es en su mayoría alta recientemente. Esto conduce al siguiente enfoque de ventana-HMM. Dada un hmm λ pre-entrenado de carga cognitiva humana y la reciente secuencia de observación de longitud W, deje que el parámetro W sea el tamaño efectivo de la ventana, ελ t el estado oculto estimado en el paso de tiempo t.Primero aplique el HMM a la secuencia de observación para encontrar la secuencia óptima de los estados ocultos Sλ t = S1S2 · · · SW (algoritmo Viterbi). Luego, calcule el estado oculto estimado ελ t para el paso de tiempo actual, viéndolo en función de sλ t. Consideramos todos los estados ocultos en sλ t, ponderados por su distancia respectiva a ελ t - 1 (el estado estimado del último paso): el más cercano de un estado en sλ t el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 397 a ελ t-1, la mayor probabilidad de que el estado sea ελ t.ελ t se establece para ser el estado con la mayor probabilidad (tenga en cuenta que un estado puede tener múltiples apariencias en sλ t). Más formalmente, la probabilidad de estado s ∈ S es ελ t viene dada por: pλ (s, t) = s = sj ∈Sλ t η (sj) e− | sj −ελ t - 1 |, (1) donde η (SJ) = EJ / W K = 1 Ek es el peso de Sj ∈ Sλ t (el estado oculto más reciente tiene la influencia más significativa para predecir el siguiente estado). El estado estimado para el paso actual es el estado con la máxima probabilidad: ελ t = argmax s∈Sλ t pλ (s, t) (2) 3.2 Modelo de carga de procesamiento de agente de acuerdo con la teoría del esquema [11], pueden ser múltiples elementos de informaciónDelguinado como elementos individuales en esquemas cognitivos. Un esquema puede tener una gran cantidad de información, pero se procesa como una sola unidad. Adaptamos esta idea y suponemos que el agente es la estimación de la carga de procesamiento del agente JS en el paso de tiempo T es una función de dos factores: el número de fragmentos CJ (t) y el número total SJ (t) de información considerando el agente j. Si CJ (T) y SJ (T) son observables al Agente I, Agente I puede emplear un enfoque de ventana-HMM como se describe en la Sección 3.1 para modelar y estimar la carga de procesamiento instantánea del agente JS. En el estudio informado a continuación, también utilizamos modelos HMM de 5 estados para la carga de procesamiento de agentes. Con los 5 estados ocultos similares a los modelos HMM adoptados para la carga cognitiva humana, empleamos distribuciones de probabilidad de observación gaussiana multivariada para los estados ocultos.3.3 Modelo de carga de procesamiento HAPS Como se discutió anteriormente, un par de agentes humanos (HAP) se ve como una unidad cuando se asocia con otros HAP. La carga de procesamiento de un HAP puede modelarse como el coeficiente de la carga de procesamiento del agente y la carga cognitiva del socio humano según lo capturado por el agente. Supongamos que el agente AI tiene modelos para su carga de procesamiento y su socio humano su carga cognitiva. Denota la carga de procesamiento del agente y la carga cognitiva humana de HAP HI, AI en el paso de tiempo T por μi t y νi t, respectivamente. El agente ai puede usar μi t y νi t para estimar la carga de hi, ai en su conjunto. Del mismo modo, si μJ t y νJ t son observables para el agente ai, puede estimar la carga de HJ, AJ. Para la simplicidad del modelo, todavía utilizamos modelos HMM de 5 estados para la carga de procesamiento HAP, con los estados ocultos estimados de la carga de procesamiento de agentes correspondientes y la carga cognitiva humana como los vectores de observación de entrada. Construir un modelo de estimación de carga es el medio. El objetivo es usar el modelo para mejorar el rendimiento del intercambio de información para que un equipo pueda formar modelos mentales mejores compartidos (por ejemplo, para desarrollar expectativas de roles entre agentes en su colaboración), que es la clave para el alto rendimiento del equipo.3.4 Procesamiento de información sensible a la carga Cada agente debe adoptar una determinada estrategia para procesar la información entrante. En lo que respecta a los agentes limitados por los recursos, no es útil que un agente comparta información con compañeros de equipo que ya están sobrecargados;Simplemente no tienen la capacidad de procesar la información. Considere la estrategia de procesamiento de información entrante como se muestra en la Tabla 1. El Agente AI (de HAPI) ignora toda la información entrante cuando está sobrecargada, y procesa toda la información entrante cuando se carga negligiblemente. Cuando se trata de la Tabla 1: Estrategia de procesamiento de información entrante, la estrategia de carga HAPI ignora demasiado toda la información compartida considerar en gran medida a cada compañero de equipo a ∈ [1, 1 Q | Q |], procesar aleatoriamente la mitad de la información de a;Ignore la información de cualquier compañero de equipo b ∈ (1 q | q |, | q |] procese bastante la mitad de la información compartida de cualquier compañero de equipo procesa ligeramente toda la información de cualquier a ∈ [1, 1 q | q |]; para cualquier compañero de equipo b ∈(1 Q | Q |, | Q |] Procesar al azar la mitad de la información de B de B de manera negativa.El paso actual; Q es una constante conocida por todos. Está muy cargado, IA procesa al azar la mitad de los mensajes de aquellos agentes que son los primeros compañeros de equipo 1/Q aparecieron en su cola de comunicación; cuando está bastante cargado, AI procesa al azar la mitadDe los mensajes de cualquier compañero de equipo; cuando está ligeramente cargado, AI procesa todos los mensajes de aquellos agentes que son los primeros compañeros de equipo 1/Q aparecieron en su cola de comunicación, y procesa al azar la mitad de los mensajes de otros compañeros de equipo. Para alentar aún más compartir información en el momento adecuado, la última fila de la Tabla 1 dice que Hapi, si no ha enviado información a HAPJ que actualmente está sobrecargado, procesará toda la información de HAPJ. Esto puede justificarse desde la perspectiva de asignación de recursos: un agente puede reasignar su recurso informático reservado para la comunicación para mejorar su capacidad de información de procesamiento. Esta estrategia favorece que nunca envíe información a un compañero de equipo sobrecargado, y sugiere que estimar y explotar las cargas de otros puede ser crítico para permitir que un agente compartiera la información correcta con la parte correcta en el momento correcto.4. La implementación del sistema SMMall (modelos mentales compartidos para todos) es una arquitectura de agente cognitivo desarrollado para apoyar la computación colaborativa centrada en el ser humano. Hace hincapié en el papel de los humanos en las actividades del equipo mediante conceptos colaborativos novedosos y múltiples representaciones de contexto entretejidos a través de todos los aspectos del trabajo del equipo. Aquí describimos dos componentes pertinentes al experimento informado en la Sección 5: comunicación multipartidista y mapas mentales compartidos (una descripción completa del sistema SMMall está más allá del alcance de este documento).4.1 Comunicación multipartidista La comunicación multipartidista se refiere a conversaciones que involucran a más de dos partes. Además del orador, los oyentes involucrados en una conversación pueden clasificarse en varios roles, como los destinatarios (los oyentes directos), los auditores (los oyentes previstos), los oyentes (los oyentes no intencionados pero anticipados) y los españolas (los oyentes no anticipados). La comunicación multipartidista es una de las características de los equipos humanos. Los pequeños agentes, que pueden formar pares de agentes humanos con socios humanos, apoyan la comunicación de múltiples partidos con las siguientes características.1. Small admite una colección de performadores multipartidistas como Minform (informes multipartidistas), anuncia (anuncio multipartidista) y MASK (Ask MultiParty). Los oyentes de una performativa multipartidista pueden ser destinatarios, auditores y outalladores, que corresponden a, CC y BCC en términos de correo electrónico, respectivamente.2. Pequeños admite la comunicación canalizada. Allí 398 el sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y los sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) son tres canales incorporados: AgentTalk Channel (comunicación específica de actividad entre agentes), canal de control (meta comunicación para la coordinación del equipo) y el canal mundial (comunicación con el mundo externo con el mundo externo). Un agente puede sintonizar completamente un canal para recopilar mensajes enviados (o CC, BCC). Un agente también puede sintonizar parcialmente un canal para obtener información estadística sobre los mensajes comunicados a través del canal. Esto es particularmente útil si un agente quiere conocer la carga de comunicación impuesta a un compañero de equipo.4.2 Mapa de creencias compartidas y visualización de carga Un concepto Se ha propuesto e implementado un mapa de creencias compartidas en SMMall;Esto responde a la necesidad de buscar perspectivas o conceptos innovadores que permitan a los miembros del grupo representar de manera efectiva y razonar sobre modelos mentales compartidos en diferentes niveles de abstracción. Como se describe en la Sección 5, los humanos y los agentes interactuaron a través de mapas de creencias compartidos en la evaluación de modelos de carga basados en HMM. Un mapa de creencias compartido es una tabla con redes de información codificadas por colores asociados con información. Cada fila captura el modelo de creencia de un miembro del equipo, y cada columna corresponde a un tipo de información específico (todas las columnas juntas definen el límite del espacio de información que se está considerando). Por lo tanto, el CIJ de celda de información de un mapa codifica todas las creencias (instancias) del tipo de información j en poder del agente i. La codificación de color se aplica a cada celda de información para indicar el número de instancias de información en poder del agente correspondiente. El concepto de mapa de creencias compartido ayuda a mantener y presentar a una pareja humana con una visión de sinergia de los modelos mentales compartidos que evolucionan dentro de un equipo. Brevemente, SMMall ha implementado el concepto con las siguientes características: 1. Se puede aparecer un menú contextual para cada celda de información para ver y compartir las instancias de información asociadas. Permite selectivo (subconjunto seleccionado) o compartir información holística.2. Comercio de información de iniciativa mixta: tanto los agentes como los socios humanos pueden iniciar una conversación multipartidista. También permite compartir información de terceros, por ejemplo, A comparte la información en poder de B con C. 3. Los tipos de información que están semánticamente relacionados (por ejemplo, por reglas de inferencia) pueden estar estrechamente organizados. Por lo tanto, las células de información cercanas pueden formar mesetas significativas (o líneas de contorno) de colores similares. Las mesetas coloreadas indican aquellas secciones de un modelo mental compartido que tienen grados superpuestos altos.4. La diferencia de color perceptible (tono) manifestada a partir de un mapa de creencias compartido indica la diferencia de información entre los miembros del equipo y, por lo tanto, representa visualmente las necesidades potenciales de información de cada miembro del equipo (ver Figura 3). SMMall también ha implementado los modelos basados en HMM (Sección 3) para permitir que un agente estime sus socios humanos y otros miembros del equipo de cargas cognitivas/de procesamiento. Como se muestra en la Fig. 3, debajo del mapa de creencias compartidas hay una pantalla de carga para cada miembro del equipo. Hay 2 curvas en una pantalla: el azul (oscuro) traza las cargas cognitivas instantáneas humanas y el rojo traza las cargas de procesamiento de un HAP en su conjunto. Si hay N miembros del equipo N, cada agente necesita mantener modelos basados en 2n Hmm para admitir las pantallas de carga. La pareja humana de un HAP puede ajustar su carga cognitiva en tiempo de ejecución, así como monitorear otra carga de procesamiento de agentes HAPS y su probabilidad de procesar la información que envía en el paso de tiempo actual. Por lo tanto, cuanto más se pueda estimar un HAP las cargas de procesamiento reales de otros HAP, mejor rendimiento de intercambio de información puede lograr el HAP. Figura 3: Pantalla de mapa mental compartido en suma, los mapas de creencias compartidas permiten la inferencia de quién necesita qué, y las pantallas de carga permiten el juicio de cuándo compartir información. Juntos nos permiten investigar el impacto de compartir la información correcta.con la parte correcta en el momento adecuado en la evolución de los modelos mentales compartidos.4.3 Métricas para modelos mentales compartidos Aquí describimos cómo medimos el rendimiento del equipo en nuestro experimento. Utilizamos el porcentaje de superposición del modelo mental (MMOP) como base para medir modelos mentales compartidos. MMOP de un grupo se define como la intersección de todos los estados mentales individuales en relación con la unión de los estados mentales individuales del grupo. Formalmente, dado un grupo de k agentes g = {ai | 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, que bi = {iim | 1 ≤ m ≤ n} sea las creencias (información) en poder del agente ai, donde cada iim es un conjunto deLa información del mismo tipo, y N (el tamaño del espacio de información) se fija para los agentes en G, luego MMOP (G) = 100 N 1≤M≤N (| ∩1≤i≤k IIM | | ∪1≤ úsanoi≤k iim |).(3) Primero, se puede medir un modelo mental compartido en términos de la distancia del subgrupo promedio MMMOP a la MMOP de todo el grupo. Sin perder la generalidad, definimos la distancia SMM emparejada (subgrupos de tamaño 2) D2 como: d2 (g) = 1≤i <j≤k (mMOP ({ai, aj}) - mmop (g)) 2.(4) El MMOP de un subgrupo siempre es más grande que el MMOP de todo el grupo. Intuitivamente, la mayor distancia desde el MMOP de un subgrupo a la de todo el grupo, más se superponen los modelos mentales superpuestos que comparte el subgrupo. Esta noción se puede utilizar para medir la opresión de un subgrupo emergente o guiar el proceso de coalición del equipo. En segundo lugar, debido a los límites de procesamiento de comunicación o de información, cada individuos Medidas subjetivas de los grupos MMOP puede ser muy diferente de los grupos MMOP medidos objetivamente desde el Exterior. Por lo tanto, se puede medir un modelo mental compartido en términos de cercanía de la medida de los individuos de los grupos MMOP a la medida objetiva. Deje que MMOP (G) y M MOPI (G) sean la medida objetiva y la medida subjetiva del agente de los grupos compartidos modelos mentales, respectivamente. Definimos la desviación SMM d⊥ como: d⊥ (g) = 1≤i≤k (mMOPI (g) - mMOP (g)) 2.(5) Obviamente, D⊥ mide la coherencia de todo el grupo: cuanto más pequeño, mejor. Tercero, los modelos mentales compartidos evolucionan con el tiempo. Se puede medir un modelo mental compartido en términos de la estabilidad de las medidas instantáneas de MMOP, D o D⊥ el Sexto INTL. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 399 con el tiempo. Los equipos de alto rendimiento a menudo pueden mantener sus modelos mentales compartidos de manera que el MMOP sea estable a un nivel aceptable a medida que avanzan las actividades, mientras que la medida MMOP de los modelos mentales compartidos de un equipo de bajo rendimiento puede fluctuar o disminuir notablemente con el tiempo.5. Evaluación del experimento En esta sección describimos los experimentos realizados para evaluar los modelos de estimación de carga y el concepto de mapa de creencias compartido para desarrollar modelos mentales compartidos en equipo.5.1 Descripción del problema Los miembros de un equipo HAP (es decir, un equipo compuesto por pares de agentes humanos) están situados en un entorno dinámico. Debido a su diferente observabilidad (tal vez superpuesta), en cada paso de tiempo pueden obtener información situacional diferente. El objetivo de un equipo de HAP es compartir selectivamente información de manera oportuna para desarrollar la conciencia de la situación global (por ejemplo, para tomar decisiones críticas). Cada ejecución del experimento tiene 45 pasos de tiempo;Cada paso de tiempo dura 15 segundos. Un paso de tiempo comienza con ciertas infoCells del mapa de creencias compartido que se destaca rápidamente (durante 2 s). Las celdas parpadeadas son exactamente aquellas con información recientemente disponible que deberían compartirse en ese momento. Una celda de información está congelada al final de un paso de tiempo: la información asociada ya no es compartible. Esto requiere que la información recién disponible se comparta a tiempo, no más tarde. El humano y el agente de un HAP asumen diferentes roles. Un agente rige la comunicación grupal y procesa mensajes para actualizar el mapa de creencias compartidas en su pantalla. Un agente, con un modelo de carga cognitiva basado en HMM previamente entrenado para su socio humano y un modelo de carga de procesamiento para cada uno de los otros HAP en el equipo, también estima y muestra sus cargas instantáneas. Los sujetos humanos deben realizar una tarea primaria y una tarea secundaria. La tarea secundaria de un sujeto humano es recordar y marcar las celdas que se muestran (no necesariamente en el orden exacto) por los clics del mouse izquierdo. El rendimiento de la tarea secundaria en el paso T se mide así como el número de células marcadas (recordadas) correctamente en T, que se toma como el estado observable del modelo de carga cognitiva a base de HMM de ese sujeto humano. La tarea principal de un sujeto humano es construir un modelo mental compartido de la situación dinámica compartiendo la información correcta con la parte correcta en el momento correcto. Para compartir la información asociada con una celda de información, un sujeto humano necesita hacer clic en el botón derecho del mouse en la celda y seleccionar los compañeros de equipo receptores en el menú emergente. Hay costos asociados con el intercambio de información. Las comunicaciones entre los HAP se realizan por los agentes SMMall correspondientes, que tienen una capacidad limitada NIN para procesar información entrante y una capacidad de comunicación saliente limitada no. Por lo tanto, dependiendo de la carga de HAP actual, un agente puede ignorar aleatoriamente la parte o la totalidad de la información entrante (no tiene ningún efecto en el establecimiento de modelos mentales compartidos). Por otro lado, cada paso de tiempo en la mayor parte del número de comandos de intercambio de información puede ser efectivo;Más que eso no contribuye nada al establecimiento de modelos mentales compartidos. Enviar información a un compañero de equipo sobrecargado desperdiciará la capacidad que de otra manera se puede usar para compartir información con un compañero de equipo menos cargado. Esto significa que en cada vez el paso un sujeto humano tiene que pasar cuidadosamente por tres decisiones cognitivas: si la información en consideración debe compartirse (es decir, si está asociado con una célula de información que acaba de flashear), si un miembro del equipo es elParte adecuada para compartir la información con (es decir, si realmente necesita la información), y si este es el momento adecuado para compartir (es decir, si el miembro del equipo está actualmente sobrecargado). La descripción anterior se aplica a los equipos HAP. Solo para equipos compuestos por agentes SMMall, los agentes tomarán todos los roles desempeñados por un agente o un socio humano en equipos HAP.5.2 Diseño del experimento Para investigar los impactos de los modelos de carga basados en HMM en la evolución de los modelos mentales compartidos (SMM), realizamos experimentos para los equipos de agentes y los equipos de HAP, donde los equipos de agentes involucran solo modelos de carga de procesamiento de agentes, los equipos de HAP involucran modelosde carga de procesamiento HAP (es decir, el coeficiente de la carga de procesamiento de agentes y la carga cognitiva humana). Para obtener información sobre cómo las predicciones de carga y la comunicación multipartidista pueden afectar el rendimiento de la formación de SMM, diseñamos 3 equipos de agentes (TA1, TA2, TA3) y 3 equipos HAP (Th1, Th2, Th3), donde todos los agentes adoptan la estrategiaen la Tabla 1 para enviar y procesar información. Al compartir información, los equipos de tipo 1 (TA1, Th1) ignoran las predicciones de carga;Los equipos de tipo 2 (TA2, Th2) consideran predicciones de carga;Los equipos de tipo 3 (TA3, TH3) siguen las predicciones de carga más estrictamente en el sentido de que los agentes agruparán aún más los receptores de un mensaje multipartidista (minform) por sus cargas y dividirán el mensaje en múltiples mensajes con sus receptores que tienen el mismocarga. Por ejemplo, dado que los agentes A1, A2, A3 tienen carga 1, 2, 1, respectivamente. Un agente A0 en un equipo de TA2 puede enviar un mensaje multipartidista, mientras que un agente A0 en un equipo de TA3 enviará dos mensajes (uno a A2, uno a1 y A3). Además, controlamos las capacidades de comunicación salientes de agentes variando de 6, 8, 10. Debido a las limitaciones sobre la capacidad de comunicación y la capacidad de procesamiento, un agente puede ser inexacto al rastrear modelos mentales de otros compañeros de equipo. Para medir los modelos mentales compartidos reales, se agregó un agente SMMall especial llamado Omniall a cada equipo para monitorear las comunicaciones entre agentes y registrar los efectos reales del intercambio de información en el modelo mental de cada agente. Esto se da cuenta de una manera, como lo sugirió Klimoski [6], a medir el grado de superposición en zonas de conciencia de situación inmediata, intermedia y a largo plazo en poder de los miembros del grupo. También grabamos una utilidad instantánea para compartir información, que se define de la siguiente manera. En cada paso de tiempo, deje que T = T0, T1, T2, T3, T4 sea una secuencia de conjuntos, donde T0, T1, T2, T3 y T4 son conjuntos de compañeros de equipo cuyos estados de carga actuales son negligentemente, ligeramente justos, justos, fuertemente, y demasiado respectivamente. Sea s el conjunto de comandos de intercambio de información emitidos por un socio humano en el paso actual. Deje mi = {tk ∈ T | k ≤ i, tk = ∅}. La utilidad instantánea de intercambio de información se define como el valor c∈S s (c)/| s |, donde s valor (c) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 0 receptor (c) ∈ T4 0 C se sabe que el receptor (c) 1/| Mi |receptor (c) ∈ Ti, i = 4 (6) En suma, este estudio involucró a 18 tipos de equipos, cada equipo tenía 4 miembros y cada tipo de equipo fue probado por 10 escenarios de dominio.Se reclutaron 30 sujetos humanos para equipos HAP. Los resultados del experimento se trazan en las Figuras 4, 6 y 7. Luego presentamos nuestros hallazgos en este estudio.5.3 Estimación de carga Betters Información SHARING 400 El sexto intl.

Considere equipos de tipo 1 (TA1, Th1) y equipos de tipo 2 (TA2, Th2). Primero mire al rendimiento de los equipos de HAP en la Fig. 4, tenemos: (1) para cada tipo de equipo, el rendimiento (porcentaje de horas extras SMM) promedió más de 10 equipos a medida que aumentó la capacidad de comunicación (Th1-6 <Th18 <Th1-10, Th2-6 <Th2-8 <Th2-10).(2) El rendimiento promedio de los equipos Th2 se desempeñó consistentemente mejor que los equipos Th1 para cada configuración de capacidad (Th2-6> Th1-6, Th2-8> Th1-8, Th2-10> Th1-10) y la diferencia de rendimientode los equipos Th1 y Th2 aumentaron a medida que aumentaba la capacidad de comunicación. Esto indica que, en igualdad de condiciones, el beneficio de explotar la estimación de la carga cuando compartir información se vuelve más significativa cuando la capacidad de comunicación es mayor. De la Fig. 4, se pueden derivar los mismos hallazgos para el rendimiento de los equipos de agentes. Además, los resultados también muestran que los SMM de cada tipo de equipo se mantuvieron constantemente en un cierto nivel después de aproximadamente 20 pasos de tiempo. Sin embargo, mantener un SMM constantemente en un cierto nivel es una tarea de equipo no trivial. El rendimiento de los equipos que no compartieron ninguna información (la curva de nostano en la Fig. 4) disminuyó constantemente a medida que avanzaba el tiempo.5.4 Comunicación multipartidista para SMM Ahora comparamos equipos de Tipo 2 y Tipo 3 (que divide los mensajes multipartidistas por las cargas de receptores). Como se trazó en la Fig. 4, para los equipos HAP, el rendimiento del tipo 2 de equipo para cada capacidad de comunicación fija fue consistentemente mejor que el tipo 3 de equipo (Th3-6≤th2-6, Th3-8 <Th2-8, Th3-10 <Th210);La diferencia se volvió más significativa a medida que aumentaba la capacidad de comunicación. Estos también se mantienen para los equipos de agentes (uno superior en la Fig. 4). En realidad, el rendimiento del tipo 3 (a) (b) a b c minform i a b c informar. Informo informo I Figura 5: Mensajes multipartidistas.Los equipos de agentes fueron aún peores (por cada capacidad fija) que el rendimiento de los equipos de agentes tipo 1. Esto puede explicarse por la diferencia de comunicaciones bipartidistas y múltiples. En SMMall, para habilitar la inferencia a nivel de equipo, cada agente mantiene un modelo interno del modelo mental (creencias) de cada miembro del equipo. Según la semántica de MinForm (informes múltiples), cuando un minforma i a los demás, suponiendo que todos los receptores y outorios aceptarán que actualizará su modelo interno de sus creencias;Cada uno de los receptores (outalladores), al recibir el mensaje, actualizará sus propias creencias, así como su modelo de los remitentes y todas las demás creencias de los receptores. En comparación con los performativos bipartidistas, los performativos de varias partes son preferibles para formar modelos mentales compartidos. Como se ilustra en la Fig. 5 (a), el agente A solo necesita realizar minForm una vez (con B y C siendo receptores) para lograr el conocimiento común de la creencia compartida sobre I (consume 2 de los recursos de comunicación, uno para cada receptor). Sin embargo, para lograr los mismos efectos utilizando Inform (Fig. 5 (b)), es difícil formar SMM a nivel de equipo, especialmente cuando el tamaño del equipo es grande (falta una información anulará todos los demás esfuerzos). Además, aunque el agente A todavía consume 2, todo el equipo necesita más recursos (3 en este caso). Sin embargo, dividir los mensajes de varias partes por parte de las cargas de receptores mejora los SMM de subgrupos. En la Fig. 6 trazamos las otras dos medidas de SMM (distancia y cercanía como se define en la Sec. 4.3). Para los equipos HAP, Th3> Th2> Th1 se mantiene en la Fig. 6 (c) (distancias más grandes indican una mejor SMMS del subgrupo), y Th3 <Th2 <Th1 se mantiene en la Fig. 6 (d) (desviaciones más pequeñas indican una mayor coherencia de todo el equipo de todo el equipo). Por lo tanto, los equipos HAP de Tipo 3 lograron mejores SMM de subgrupos, y los miembros de su equipo tenían una visión coherente más alta de los SMM del grupo que los equipos de otros tipos. Para los equipos de agentes, Th3> Th1> Th2 se mantiene en la Fig. 6 (a), y Th2 <Th3 <Th1 se mantiene en la Fig. 6 (b). Por lo tanto, los equipos de agentes de tipo 3 lograron mejores SMM del subgrupo, y los miembros de su equipo tenían una visión coherente mucho más alta de los SMM del grupo que los equipos de tipo 1 (aunque un poco peor que el tipo de equipo 2). Por lo tanto, en general, la comunicación multipartidista fomenta la formación/evolución de los SMM del equipo. Cuando un grupo de agentes puede dividirse en subteames, dividir los mensajes por sus cargas puede ser más efectivo para los SMM de subteam.5.5 El modelo cognitivo basado en HMM para validar el modelo de carga cognitiva basado en HMM es extremadamente difícil porque la detección de la carga cognitiva real y resistente al ruido de los seres humanos está mucho más allá de la tecnología actual. Como juicio indirecto, trazamos las líneas ajustadas por la regresión para los medios para compartir información de los equipos HAP con y sin pantallas de carga. Para los equipos de HAP con pantallas de carga, existe una fuerte relación lineal negativa entre la utilidad de intercambio de información y los niveles de carga cognitiva (el coeficiente de correlación de Pearson es-√ 0.899 = −0.948 con valor P = 0.014). Debido a que la medida de utilidad de intercambio de información y la medida de carga cognitiva son indicadores del rendimiento de la tarea primaria y el rendimiento de la tarea secundaria, respectivamente, su relación lineal cumple con los estudios cognitivos de que el rendimiento secundario de la tarea se puede utilizar el sexto INTL.

Sin embargo, para los equipos sin pantallas de carga existe una fuerte relación cuadrática en lugar de lineal (el coeficiente de correlación es √ 0.974 = 0.987 con valor p = 0.015). Esto indica que el desempeño de intercambio de información de un equipo HAP puede verse significativamente afectado por la carga cognitiva de los sujetos humanos, y la conciencia de la carga de otros miembros del equipo. Conocer la carga de otros (por estimación) reducirá la relación cuadrática con una relación lineal. Figura 7: Utilidad para compartir información por cargas cognitivas.6. Conclusión La atención reciente de la investigación sobre el trabajo en equipo centrado en el ser humano exige altamente el diseño de los sistemas de agentes como ayudas cognitivas que pueden modelar y explotar las capacidades cognitivas de los socios humanos para ofrecer ayuda de manera inexpresiva. En este artículo, investigamos varios factores que rodean el desafiante problema de evolucionar modelos mentales compartidos de equipos compuestos de pares de agentes humanos. La principal contribución de esta investigación incluye (1) modelos de carga basados en HMM para que un agente estimara la carga cognitiva de sus socios humanos y otras cargas de procesamiento de compañeros de equipo HAP;(2) Se introdujo e implementó el concepto de mapa de creencias compartido. Permite a los miembros del grupo representar efectivamente y razonar sobre modelos mentales compartidos;(3) Se realizaron experimentos para evaluar los modelos de carga cognitivos/de procesamiento basados en HMM y los impactos de la comunicación multipartidista en la evolución de los SMM del equipo. La utilidad de los mapas de creencias compartidos también se demostró durante los experimentos.7. Referencias [1] A. D. Baddeley. Memoria de trabajo. Science, 255: 556-559, 1992. [2] J. Bradshaw, M.

        "INTRODUCTION The entire movement of agent paradigm was spawned, at least in part, by the perceived importance of fostering human-like adjustable autonomy.",
        "Human-centered multiagent teamwork has thus attracted increasing attentions in multi-agent systems field [2, 10, 4].",
        "Humans and autonomous systems (agents) are generally thought to be complementary: while humans are limited by their cognitive capacity in information processing, they are superior in spatial, heuristic, and analogical reasoning; autonomous systems can continuously learn expertise and tacit problem-solving knowledge from humans to improve system performance.",
        "In short, humans and agents can team together to achieve better performance, given that they could establish certain mutual awareness to coordinate their mixed-initiative activities.",
        "However, the foundation of human-agent collaboration keeps being challenged because of nonrealistic modeling of mutual awareness of the state of affairs.",
        "In particular, few researchers look beyond to assess the principles of modeling shared mental constructs between a human and his/her assisting agent.",
        "Moreover, human-agent relationships can go beyond partners to teams.",
        "Many informational processing limitations of individuals can be alleviated by having a group perform tasks.",
        "Although groups also can create additional costs centered on communication, resolution of conflict, and social acceptance, it is suggested that such limitations can be overcome if people have shared cognitive structures for interpreting task and social requirements [8].",
        "Therefore, there is a clear demand for investigations to broaden and deepen our understanding on the principles of shared mental modeling among members of a mixed human-agent team.",
        "There are lines of research on multi-agent teamwork, both theoretically and empirically.",
        "For instance, Joint Intention [3] and SharedPlans [5] are two theoretical frameworks for specifying agent collaborations.",
        "One of the drawbacks is that, although both have a deep philosophical and cognitive root, they do not accommodate the modeling of human team members.",
        "Cognitive studies suggested that teams which have shared mental models are expected to have common expectations of the task and team, which allow them to predict the behavior and resource needs of team members more accurately [14, 6].",
        "Cannon-Bowers et al. [14] explicitly argue that team members should hold compatible models that lead to common expectations.",
        "We agree on this and believe that the establishment of shared expectations among human and agent team members is a critical step to advance human-centered teamwork research.",
        "It has to be noted that the concept of shared expectation can broadly include role assignment and its dynamics, teamwork schemas and progresses, communication patterns and intentions, etc.",
        "While the long-term goal of our research is to understand how shared cognitive structures can enhance human-agent team performance, the specific objective of the work reported here is to develop a computational cognitive 395 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS capacity model to facilitate the establishment of shared expectations.",
        "In particular, we argue that to favor humanagent collaboration, an agent system should be designed to allow the estimation and prediction of human teammates (relative) cognitive loads, and use that to offer improvised, unintrusive help.",
        "Ideally, being able to predict the cognitive/processing capacity curves of teammates could allow a team member to help the right party at the right time, avoiding unbalanced work/cognitive loads among the team.",
        "The last point is on the modeling itself.",
        "Although an agents cognitive model of its human peer is not necessarily to be descriptively accurate, having at least a realistic model can be beneficial in offering unintrusive help, bias reduction, as well as trustable and self-adjustable autonomy.",
        "For example, although humans use of cognitive simplification mechanisms (e.g., heuristics) does not always lead to errors in judgment, it can lead to predictable biases in responses [8].",
        "It is feasible to develop agents as cognitive aids to alleviate humans biases, as long as an agent can be trained to obtain a model of a humans cognitive inclination.",
        "With a realistic human cognitive model, an agent can also better adjust its automation level.",
        "When its human peer is becoming overloaded, an agent can take over resource-consuming tasks, shifting the humans limited cognitive resources to tasks where a humans role is indispensable.",
        "When its human peer is underloaded, an agent can take the chance to observe the humans operations to refine its cognitive model of the human.",
        "Many studies have documented that human choices and behaviors do not agree with predictions from rational models.",
        "If agents could make recommendations in ways that humans appreciate, it would be easier to establish trust relationships between agents and humans; this in turn, will encourage humans automation uses.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review cognitive load theories and measurements.",
        "A HMM-based cognitive load model is given in Section 3 to support resource-bounded teamwork among human-agentpairs.",
        "Section 4 describes the key concept shared belief map as implemented in SMMall, and Section 5 reports the experiments for evaluating the cognitive models and their impacts on the evolving of shared mental models. 2.",
        "COGNITIVE CAPACITY-OVERVIEW People are information processors.",
        "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
        "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
        "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
        "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
        "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
        "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
        "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
        "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
        "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
        "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
        "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
        "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
        "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
        "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
        "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
        "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
        "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
        "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
        "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
        "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
        "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
        "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
        "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
        "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

        "HUMAN-CENTERED TEAMWORK MODEL People are limited information processors, and so are intelligent agent systems; this is especially true when they act under hard or soft timing constraints imposed by the domain problems.",
        "In respect to our goal to build realistic expectations among teammates, we take two important steps.",
        "First, agents are resource-bounded; their processing capacity is limited by computing resources, inference knowledge, concurrent tasking capability, etc.",
        "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
        "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",
        "Taking this approach will largely change the way in which an agent views (models) the involvement and cooperativeness of its teammates in a team activity.",
        "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",
        "This being said, we are not dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable.",
        "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",
        "Second, human teammates are bounded by their cognitive capacities.",
        "As far as we know, the research reported here is the first attempt in the area of humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers building and using humans cognitive load model to facilitate teamwork involving both humans and agents.",
        "We use Hi, Ai to denote Human-Agent-Pair (HAP) i. 3.1 Computational Cognitive Capacity Model An intelligent agent being a cognitive aid, it is desirable that the model of its human partner implemented within the agent is cognitively-acceptable, if not descriptively accurate.",
        "Of course, building a cognitive load model that is cognitively-acceptable is not trivial; there exist a variety of cognitive load theories and different measuring techniques.",
        "We here choose to focus on the performance variables of secondary tasks, given the ample evidence supporting secondary task performance as a highly sensitive and reliable technique for measuring humans cognitive load [12].",
        "Its worth noting that just for the purpose of estimating a human subjects cognitive load, any artificial task (e.g, pressing a button in response to unpredictable stimuli) can be used as a secondary task to force the subject to go through.",
        "However, in a realistic application, we have to make sure that the selected secondary task interacts with the primary task in meaningful ways, which is not easy and often depends on the domain problem at hand.",
        "For example, in the experiment below, we used the number of newly available information correctly recalled as the secondary task, and the effective0 1 2 3 4 negligibly slightly fairly heavily overly 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.25 0.25 0.1 0.2 0.2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ≥ 9 B = 0 1 2 3 4 ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 0 0 0 0 0 0.02 0.03 0.05 0.1 0.8 0 0 0 0 0 0.05 0.05 0.1 0.7 0.1 0 0 0 0 0.01 0.02 0.45 0.4 0.1 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.05 0.15 0.4 0.3 0.03 0.02 0 0 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ Figure 2: A HMM Cognitive Load Model. ness of information sharing as the primary task.",
        "This is realistic to intelligence workers because in time stress situations they have to know what information to share in order to effectively establish an awareness of the global picture.",
        "In the following, we adopt the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach [13] to model humans cognitive capacity.",
        "It is thus assumed that at each time step the secondary task performance of a human subject in a team composed of human-agent-pairs (HAP) is observable to all the team members.",
        "Human team members secondary task performance is used for estimating their hidden cognitive loads.",
        "A HMM is denoted by λ = N, V, A, B, π , where N is a set of hidden states, V is a set of observation symbols, A is a set of state transition probability distributions, B is a set of observation symbol probability distributions (one for each hidden state), and π is the initial state distribution.",
        "We consider a 5-state HMM model of human cognitive load as follows (Figure 2).",
        "The hidden states are 0 (negligiblyloaded), 1 (slightly-loaded), 2 (fairly-loaded), 3 (heavilyloaded), and 4 (overly loaded).",
        "The observable states are tied with secondary task performance, which, in this study, is measured in terms of the number of items correctly recalled.",
        "According to Millers 7±2 rule, the observable states take integer values from 0 to 9 ( the state is 9 when the number of items correctly recalled is no less than 9).",
        "For the example B Matrix given in Fig. 2, it is very likely that the cognitive load of the subject is negligibly when the number of items correctly recalled is larger than 9.",
        "However, to determine the current hidden load status of a human partner is not trivial.",
        "The model might be oversensitive if we only consider the last-step secondary task performance to locate the most likely hidden state.",
        "There is ample evidence suggesting that human cognitive load is a continuous function over time and does not manifest sudden shifts unless there is a fundamental changes in tasking demands.",
        "To address this issue, we place a constraint on the state transition coefficients: no jumps of more than 2 states are allowed.",
        "In addition, we take the position that, a human subject is very likely overloaded if his secondary task performance is mostly low in recent time steps, while he is very likely not overloaded if his secondary task performance is mostly high recently.",
        "This leads to the following Windowed-HMM approach.",
        "Given a pre-trained HMM λ of human cognitive load and the recent observation sequence Ot of length w, let parameter w be the effective window size, ελ t be the estimated hidden state at time step t. First apply the HMM to the observation sequence to find the optimal sequence of hidden states Sλ t = s1s2 · · · sw (Viterbi algorithm).",
        "Then, compute the estimated hidden state ελ t for the current time step, viewing it as a function of Sλ t .",
        "We consider all the hidden states in Sλ t , weighted by their respective distance to ελ t−1 (the estimated state of the last step): the closer of a state in Sλ t The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 397 to ελ t−1, the higher probability of the state being ελ t . ελ t is set to be the state with the highest probability (note that a state may have multiple appearances in Sλ t ).",
        "More formally, the probability of state s ∈ S being ελ t is given by: pλ(s, t) = s=sj ∈Sλ t η(sj)e−|sj −ελ t−1| , (1) where η(sj) = ej / w k=1 ek is the weight of sj ∈ Sλ t (the most recent hidden state has the most significant influence in predicting the next state).",
        "The estimated state for the current step is the state with maximum likelihood: ελ t = argmax s∈Sλ t pλ(s, t) (2) 3.2 Agent Processing Load Model According to schema theory [11], multiple elements of information can be chunked as single elements in cognitive schemas.",
        "A schema can hold a huge amount of information, yet is processed as a single unit.",
        "We adapt this idea and assume that agent is estimation of agent js processing load at time step t is a function of two factors: the number of chunks cj(t) and the total number sj(t) of information being considered by agent j.",
        "If cj(t) and sj(t) are observable to agent i, agent i can employ a Windowed-HMM approach as described in Section 3.1 to model and estimate agent js instantaneous processing load.",
        "In the study reported below, we also used 5-state HMM models for agent processing load.",
        "With the 5 hidden states similar to the HMM models adopted for human cognitive load, we employed multivariate Gaussian observation probability distributions for the hidden states. 3.3 HAPs Processing Load Model As discussed above, a Human-Agent-Pair (HAP) is viewed as a unit when teaming up with other HAPs.",
        "The processing load of a HAP can thus be modeled as the co-effect of the processing load of the agent and the cognitive load of the human partner as captured by the agent.",
        "Suppose agent Ai has models for its processing load and its human partner His cognitive load.",
        "Denote the agent processing load and human cognitive load of HAP Hi, Ai at time step t by μi t and νi t, respectively.",
        "Agent Ai can use μi t and νi t to estimate the load of Hi, Ai as a whole.",
        "Similarly, if μj t and νj t are observable to agent Ai, it can estimate the load of Hj, Aj .",
        "For model simplicity, we still used 5-state HMM models for HAP processing load, with the estimated hidden states of the corresponding agent processing load and human cognitive load as the input observation vectors.",
        "Building a load estimation model is the means.",
        "The goal is to use the model to enhance information sharing performance so that a team can form better shared mental models (e.g., to develop inter-agent role expectations in their collaboration), which is the key to high team performance. 3.4 Load-Sensitive Information Processing Each agent has to adopt a certain strategy to process the incoming information.",
        "As far as resource-bounded agents are concerned, it is of no use for an agent to share information with teammates who are already overloaded; they simply do not have the capacity to process the information.",
        "Consider the incoming information processing strategy as shown in Table 1.",
        "Agent Ai (of HAPi) ignores all the incoming information when it is overloaded, and processes all the incoming information when it is negligibly loaded.",
        "When it Table 1: Incoming information processing strategy HAPi Load Strategy Overly Ignore all shared info Heavily Consider every teammate A ∈ [1, 1 q |Q| ], randomly process half amount of info from A; Ignore info from any teammate B ∈ ( 1 q |Q|, |Q|] Fairly Process half of shared info from any teammate Slightly Process all info from any A ∈ [1, 1 q |Q| ]; For any teammate B ∈ ( 1 q |Q|, |Q|] randomly process half amount of info from B Negligibly Process all shared info HAPj Process all info from HAPj if it is overloaded *Q is a FIFO queue of agents from whom this HAP has received information at the current step; q is a constant known to all. is heavily loaded, Ai randomly processes half of the messages from those agents which are the first 1/q teammates appeared in its communication queue; when it is fairly loaded, Ai randomly processes half of the messages from any teammates; when it is slightly loaded, Ai processes all the messages from those agents which are the first 1/q teammates appeared in its communication queue, and randomly processes half of the messages from other teammates.",
        "To further encourage sharing information at the right time, the last row of Table 1 says that HAPi , if having not sent information to HAPj who is currently overloaded, will process all the information from HAPj .",
        "This can be justified from resource allocation perspective: an agent can reallocate its computing resource reserved for communication to enhance its capacity of processing information.",
        "This strategy favors never sending information to an overloaded teammate, and it suggests that estimating and exploiting others loads can be critical to enable an agent to share the right information with the right party at the right time. 4.",
        "SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION SMMall (Shared Mental Models for all) is a cognitive agent architecture developed for supporting human-centric collaborative computing.",
        "It stresses humans role in team activities by means of novel collaborative concepts and multiple representations of context woven through all aspects of team work.",
        "Here we describe two components pertinent to the experiment reported in Section 5: multi-party communication and shared mental maps (a complete description of the SMMall system is beyond the scope of this paper). 4.1 Multi-Party Communication Multi-party communication refers to conversations involving more than two parties.",
        "Aside from the speaker, the listeners involved in a conversation can be classified into various roles such as addressees (the direct listeners), auditors (the intended listeners), overhearers (the unintended but anticipated listeners), and eavesdroppers (the unanticipated listeners).",

        "An agent can fully tune to a channel to collect messages sent (or cc, bcc) to it.",
        "An agent can also partially tune to a channel to get statistic information about the messages communicated over the channel.",
        "This is particularly useful if an agent wants to know the communication load imposed on a teammate. 4.2 Shared Belief Map & Load Display A concept shared belief map has been proposed and implemented into SMMall; this responds to the need to seek innovative perspectives or concepts that allow group members to effectively represent and reason about shared mental models at different levels of abstraction.",
        "As described in Section 5, humans and agents interacted through shared belief maps in the evaluation of HMM-based load models.",
        "A shared belief map is a table with color-coded info-cellscells associated with information.",
        "Each row captures the belief model of one team member, and each column corresponds to a specific information type (all columns together define the boundary of the information space being considered).",
        "Thus, info-cell Cij of a map encodes all the beliefs (instances) of information type j held by agent i.",
        "Color coding applies to each info-cell to indicate the number of information instances held by the corresponding agent.",
        "The concept of shared belief map helps maintain and present a human partner with a synergy view of the shared mental models evolving within a team.",
        "Briefly, SMMall has implemented the concept with the following features: 1.",
        "A context menu can be popped up for each info-cell to view and share the associated information instances.",
        "It allows selective (selected subset) or holistic info-sharing. 2.",
        "Mixed-initiative info-sharing: both agents and human partners can initiate a multi-party conversation.",
        "It also allows third-party info-sharing, say, A shares the information held by B with C. 3.",
        "Information types that are semantically related (e.g., by inference rules) can be closely organized.",
        "Hence, nearby info-cells can form meaningful plateaus (or contour lines) of similar colors.",

        "The perceptible color (hue) difference manifested from a shared belief map indicates the information difference among team members, and hence visually represents the potential information needs of each team member (See Figure 3).",
        "SMMall has also implemented the HMM-based models (Section 3) to allow an agent to estimate its human partners and other team members cognitive/processing loads.",
        "As shown in Fig. 3, below the shared belief map there is a load display for each team member.",
        "There are 2 curves in a display: the blue (dark) one plots humans instantaneous cognitive loads and the red one plots the processing loads of a HAP as a whole.",
        "If there are n team members, each agent needs to maintain 2n HMM-based models to support the load displays.",
        "The human partner of a HAP can adjust her cognitive load at runtime, as well as monitor another HAPs agent processing load and its probability of processing the information she sends at the current time step.",
        "Thus, the more closely a HAP can estimate the actual processing loads of other HAPs, the better information sharing performance the HAP can achieve.",
        "Figure 3: Shared Mental Map Display In sum, shared belief maps allow the inference of who needs what, and load displays allow the judgment of when to share information.",
        "Together they allow us to investigate the impact of sharing the right info. with the right party at the right time on the evolving of shared mental models. 4.3 Metrics for Shared Mental Models We here describe how we measure team performance in our experiment.",
        "We use mental model overlapping percentage (MMOP) as the base to measure shared mental models.",
        "MMOP of a group is defined as the intersection of all the individual mental states relative to the union of individual mental states of the group.",
        "Formally, given a group of k agents G = {Ai|1 ≤ i ≤ k}, let Bi = {Iim|1 ≤ m ≤ n} be the beliefs (information) held by agent Ai, where each Iim is a set of information of the same type, and n (the size of information space) is fixed for the agents in G, then MMOP(G) = 100 n 1≤m≤n ( | ∩1≤i≤k Iim| | ∪1≤i≤k Iim| ). (3) First, a shared mental model can be measured in terms of the distance of averaged subgroup MMOPs to the MMOP of the whole group.",
        "Without losing generality, we define paired SMM distance (subgroups of size 2) D2 as: D2 (G) = 1≤i<j≤k (MMOP({Ai, Aj}) − MMOP(G))2 . (4) The MMOP of a subgroup is always larger than the MMOP of the whole group.",
        "Intuitively, the larger distance from the MMOP of a subgroup to that of the whole group, the more overlapping mental models the subgroup shares.",
        "This notion can be used to measure the tightness of an emerging subgroup or guide the process of team coalition.",
        "Second, due to communication or information processing limits, each individuals subjective measure of the groups MMOP can be very different from the groups MMOP measured objectively from external.",
        "A shared mental model can thus be measured in terms of the closeness of individuals measure of the groups MMOP to the objective measure.",
        "Let MMOP(G) and M MOPi(G) be the objective measure and agent Ais subjective measure of the groups shared mental models, respectively.",
        "We define SMM deviation D⊥ as: D⊥(G) = 1≤i≤k (MMOPi(G) − MMOP(G))2 . (5) Obviously, D⊥ measures the coherency of the whole group: the smaller the better.",
        "Third, shared mental models evolve over time.",
        "A shared mental model can be measured in terms of the stableness of the instantaneous measures of MMOP, D , or D⊥ The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 399 over time.",
        "High performing teams can often maintain their shared mental models such that the MMOP is stable at an acceptable level as activities proceed, while the MMOP measure of the shared mental models of a low-performing teams can fluctuate or decrease notably over time. 5.",
        "EXPERIMENT EVALUATION In this section we describe the experiments conducted to evaluate the load estimation models and the shared belief map concept for developing team shared mental models. 5.1 Problem Description The members of a HAP team (i.e., a team composed of Human-Agent-Pairs) are situated in a dynamic environment.",
        "Due to their different (maybe overlapping) observability, at each time step they may get different situational information.",
        "The goal of a HAP team is to selectively share information in a timely manner to develop global situation awareness (say, for making critical decisions).",
        "Each run of the experiment has 45 time steps; each time step lasts 15 seconds.",
        "A time step starts with certain infocells of the shared belief map being flashed quickly (for 2 s).",
        "The flashed cells are exactly those with newly available information that should be shared at that time step.",
        "An info-cell is frozen at the end of a time step: the associated information is no longer sharable.",
        "This requires that the newly available information be shared in time, not later.",
        "The human and agent of a HAP assume different roles.",
        "An agent governs group communication and processes messages to update the shared belief map on its display.",
        "An agent, with a pre-trained HMM-based cognitive load model for its human partner and a processing load model for each of the other HAPs in the team, also estimates and displays their instantaneous loads.",
        "Human subjects need to perform a primary task and a secondary task.",
        "The secondary task of a human subject is to remember and mark the cells being flashed (not necessarily in the exact order) by left mouse clicks.",
        "Secondary task performance at step t is thus measured as the number of cells marked (remembered) correctly at t, which is taken as the observable state of the HMMbased cognitive load model of that human subject.",
        "The primary task of a human subject is to build a shared mental model of the dynamic situation by sharing the right information with the right party at the right time.",
        "To share the information associated with an info-cell, a human subject needs to click the right mouse button on the cell, and select the receiving teammate(s) from the popup menu.",
        "There are costs associated with information sharing.",
        "Communications among HAPs is done by the corresponding SMMall agents, which have both limited capacity nin for processing incoming information and limited outgoing communication capacity nout.",
        "Thus, depending on the current HAP load, an agent may randomly ignore part or all of the incoming information (having no effect on the establishment of shared mental models).",
        "On the other hand, each time step at most nout number of information-sharing commands can be effective; more than that contribute nothing to the establishment of shared mental models.",
        "Sending information to an overloaded teammate will waste the capacity that otherwise can be used to share information with a less loaded teammate.",
        "This means that at each time step a human subject has to carefully go through three cognitive decisions: whether the information under consideration needs to be shared (i.e., whether it is associated with an info-cell just flashed), whether a team member is the right party to share the information with (i.e., whether it really needs the information), and whether this is the right time to share (i.e., whether the team member is currently overloaded).",
        "The above description applies to HAP teams.",
        "For teams composed of SMMall agents only, the agents will take all the roles played by an agent or a human partner in HAP teams. 5.2 Experiment Design To investigate the impacts of the HMM-based load models on the evolution of shared mental models (SMM), we conducted experiments for both Agent teams and HAP teams, where agent teams involve agent processing load models only, HAP teams involve models of HAP processing load (i.e., the co-effect of agent processing load and human cognitive load).",
        "To get insights on how load predictions and multi-party communication may affect the performance of forming SMM, we designed 3 Agent teams (TA1, TA2, TA3) and 3 HAP teams (TH1, TH2, TH3), where all agents adopt the strategy in Table 1 to send and process information.",
        "When sharing information, teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) ignore load predictions; teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2) consider load predictions; teams of type 3 (TA3, TH3) follow load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents will further group the receivers of a multi-party message (MInform) by their loads and split the message into multiple messages with their receivers having the same load.",
        "For example, given that agents A1, A2, A3 have load 1, 2, 1, respectively.",
        "An agent A0 in a team of TA2 may send one multi-party message, while an agent A0 in a team of TA3 will send two messages (one to A2, one to A1 and A3).",
        "In addition, we controlled agents outgoing communication capacities by varying from 6, 8, to 10.",
        "Due to constraints on communication capacity and processing capacity, an agent can be inaccurate when tracking other teammates mental models.",
        "In order to measure the actual shared mental models, a special SMMall agent named OmniAll was added to each team to monitor inter-agent communications and record the actual effects of information sharing on each agents mental model.",
        "This realizes a way, as suggested by Klimoski [6], to measuring the degree of overlap in immediate, intermediate, and long-term situation awareness zones held by group members.",
        "We also recorded instantaneous information sharing utility, which is defined as follows.",
        "At each time step, let T = T0, T1, T2, T3, T4 be a sequence of sets, where T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4 are sets of teammates whose current load states are negligibly, slightly, fairly, heavily, and overly respectively.",
        "Let S be the set of information-sharing commands issued by a human partner at the current step.",

        "Consider teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) and teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2).",
        "First look at the performance of HAP teams in Fig. 4, we have: (1) For each team type, the performance (percentage of SMM overtime) averaged over 10 teams increased as communication capacity increased (TH1-6<TH18<TH1-10, TH2-6<TH2-8<TH2-10). (2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
        "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",
        "From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.",
        "In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps.",
        "However, to maintain a SMM steadily at a certain level is a non-trivial team task.",
        "The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads).",
        "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",
        "These also hold for the Agent teams (upper one in Fig. 4).",
        "Actually, the performance of type 3 (a) (b) A B C MInform I A B C Inform I Inform I Inform I Figure 5: Multi-party messages. agent teams was even worse (for each fixed capacity) than the performance of type 1 agent teams.",
        "This can be explained by the difference of two-party and multi-party communications.",
        "In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team members mental model (beliefs).",
        "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
        "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
        "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
        "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",
        "Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).",
        "However, splitting multi-party messages by receivers loads does enhance subgroup SMMs.",
        "In Fig. 6 we plotted the other two measures of SMMs (distance and closeness as defined in Sec. 4.3).",
        "For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team).",
        "Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of other types.",
        "For agent teams, TH3>TH1>TH2 holds in Fig. 6(a), and TH2<TH3<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(b).",
        "Thus, agent teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had much higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of type 1 (although slightly worse than team type 2).",
        "Hence, generally, multi-party communication encourages the forming/evolving of team SMMs.",
        "When a group of agents can be partitioned into subteams, splitting messages by their loads can be more effective for subteam SMMs. 5.5 The HMM-based Cognitive Model To validate the HMM-based cognitive load model is extremely difficult because detecting the real, noise-resistant cognitive load of human beings is far beyond the current technology.",
        "As an indirect judgment, we plotted the regression fitted lines for the means of information sharing utility of HAP teams with and without load displays.",
        "For the HAP teams with load displays there is a strong negative linear relationship between info-sharing utility and cognitive load levels (Pearson correlation coefficient is − √ 0.899 = −0.948 with P-Value = 0.014).",
        "Because the info-sharing utility measure and the cognitive load measure are indicators of primary task performance and secondary task performance, respectively, their linear relationship complies with cognitive studies that secondary task performance can be used The Sixth Intl.",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",

                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",

                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",

                "An agent A0 in a team of TA2 may send one multi-party message, while an agent A0 in a team of TA3 will send two messages (one to A2, one to A1 and A3).",
                "In addition, we controlled agents outgoing communication capacities by varying from 6, 8, to 10.",
                "Due to constraints on communication capacity and processing capacity, an agent can be inaccurate when tracking other teammates mental models.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",
                "From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.",
                "In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps.",

                "The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads).",
                "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",
                "These also hold for the Agent teams (upper one in Fig. 4).",

                "This can be explained by the difference of two-party and multi-party communications.",
                "In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team members mental model (beliefs).",
                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",
                "Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).",
                "However, splitting multi-party messages by receivers loads does enhance subgroup SMMs.",
                "In Fig. 6 we plotted the other two measures of SMMs (distance and closeness as defined in Sec. 4.3).",
                "For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team).",
                "Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of other types.",

                "COGNITIVE CAPACITY-OVERVIEW People are information processors.",
                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "HUMAN-CENTERED TEAMWORK MODEL People are limited information processors, and so are intelligent agent systems; this is especially true when they act under hard or soft timing constraints imposed by the domain problems.",
                "In respect to our goal to build realistic expectations among teammates, we take two important steps.",
                "First, agents are resource-bounded; their processing capacity is limited by computing resources, inference knowledge, concurrent tasking capability, etc.",
                "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
                "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",
                "Taking this approach will largely change the way in which an agent views (models) the involvement and cooperativeness of its teammates in a team activity.",
                "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",
                "This being said, we are not dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable.",
                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",
                "Second, human teammates are bounded by their cognitive capacities.",
                "As far as we know, the research reported here is the first attempt in the area of humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers building and using humans cognitive load model to facilitate teamwork involving both humans and agents.",
                "We use Hi, Ai to denote Human-Agent-Pair (HAP) i. 3.1 Computational Cognitive Capacity Model An intelligent agent being a cognitive aid, it is desirable that the model of its human partner implemented within the agent is cognitively-acceptable, if not descriptively accurate.",
                "Of course, building a cognitive load model that is cognitively-acceptable is not trivial; there exist a variety of cognitive load theories and different measuring techniques.",
                "We here choose to focus on the performance variables of secondary tasks, given the ample evidence supporting secondary task performance as a highly sensitive and reliable technique for measuring humans cognitive load [12].",
                "Its worth noting that just for the purpose of estimating a human subjects cognitive load, any artificial task (e.g, pressing a button in response to unpredictable stimuli) can be used as a secondary task to force the subject to go through.",
                "However, in a realistic application, we have to make sure that the selected secondary task interacts with the primary task in meaningful ways, which is not easy and often depends on the domain problem at hand.",

                "It is thus assumed that at each time step the secondary task performance of a human subject in a team composed of human-agent-pairs (HAP) is observable to all the team members.",

                "For the example B Matrix given in Fig. 2, it is very likely that the cognitive load of the subject is negligibly when the number of items correctly recalled is larger than 9.",
                "However, to determine the current hidden load status of a human partner is not trivial.",
                "The model might be oversensitive if we only consider the last-step secondary task performance to locate the most likely hidden state.",
                "There is ample evidence suggesting that human cognitive load is a continuous function over time and does not manifest sudden shifts unless there is a fundamental changes in tasking demands.",
                "To address this issue, we place a constraint on the state transition coefficients: no jumps of more than 2 states are allowed.",
                "In addition, we take the position that, a human subject is very likely overloaded if his secondary task performance is mostly low in recent time steps, while he is very likely not overloaded if his secondary task performance is mostly high recently.",

                "As far as resource-bounded agents are concerned, it is of no use for an agent to share information with teammates who are already overloaded; they simply do not have the capacity to process the information.",

                "This means that at each time step a human subject has to carefully go through three cognitive decisions: whether the information under consideration needs to be shared (i.e., whether it is associated with an info-cell just flashed), whether a team member is the right party to share the information with (i.e., whether it really needs the information), and whether this is the right time to share (i.e., whether the team member is currently overloaded).",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",
                "From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.",
                "In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps.",

                "The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads).",
                "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",

                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",
                "Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).",

                "For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team).",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
                "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",
                "Taking this approach will largely change the way in which an agent views (models) the involvement and cooperativeness of its teammates in a team activity.",
                "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",
                "This being said, we are not dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable.",
                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",
                "Second, human teammates are bounded by their cognitive capacities.",
                "As far as we know, the research reported here is the first attempt in the area of humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers building and using humans cognitive load model to facilitate teamwork involving both humans and agents.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",

                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
                "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",
                "Taking this approach will largely change the way in which an agent views (models) the involvement and cooperativeness of its teammates in a team activity.",
                "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",
                "This being said, we are not dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable.",
                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",
                "Second, human teammates are bounded by their cognitive capacities.",
                "As far as we know, the research reported here is the first attempt in the area of humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers building and using humans cognitive load model to facilitate teamwork involving both humans and agents.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",

                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",

                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human <br>problem-solving</br> activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",

                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",

                "Consider teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) and teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2).",
                "First look at the performance of HAP teams in Fig. 4, we have: (1) For each team type, the performance (percentage of SMM overtime) averaged over 10 teams increased as communication capacity increased (TH1-6<TH18<TH1-10, TH2-6<TH2-8<TH2-10). (2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",
                "From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.",
                "In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps.",
                "However, to maintain a SMM steadily at a certain level is a non-trivial team task.",
                "The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads).",
                "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",
                "These also hold for the Agent teams (upper one in Fig. 4).",

                "This can be explained by the difference of two-party and multi-party communications.",
                "In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team members mental model (beliefs).",
                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",
                "Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).",
                "However, splitting multi-party messages by receivers loads does enhance subgroup SMMs.",
                "In Fig. 6 we plotted the other two measures of SMMs (distance and closeness as defined in Sec. 4.3).",
                "For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team).",
                "Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of other types.",
                "For agent teams, TH3>TH1>TH2 holds in Fig. 6(a), and TH2<TH3<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(b).",
                "Thus, agent teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had much higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of type 1 (although slightly worse than team type 2).",
                "Hence, generally, multi-party communication encourages the forming/evolving of team SMMs.",
                "When a group of agents can be partitioned into subteams, splitting messages by their loads can be more effective for subteam SMMs. 5.5 The HMM-based Cognitive Model To validate the HMM-based cognitive load model is extremely difficult because detecting the real, noise-resistant cognitive load of human beings is far beyond the current technology.",
                "As an indirect judgment, we plotted the regression fitted lines for the means of information sharing utility of HAP teams with and without load displays.",
                "For the HAP teams with load displays there is a strong negative linear relationship between info-sharing utility and cognitive load levels (Pearson correlation coefficient is − √ 0.899 = −0.948 with P-Value = 0.014).",

                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",

                "To get insights on how load predictions and multi-party communication may affect the performance of forming SMM, we designed 3 Agent teams (TA1, TA2, TA3) and 3 HAP teams (TH1, TH2, TH3), where all agents adopt the strategy in Table 1 to send and process information.",
                "When sharing information, teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) ignore load predictions; teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2) consider load predictions; teams of type 3 (TA3, TH3) follow load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents will further group the receivers of a multi-party message (MInform) by their loads and split the message into multiple messages with their receivers having the same load.",

                "An agent A0 in a team of TA2 may send one multi-party message, while an agent A0 in a team of TA3 will send two messages (one to A2, one to A1 and A3).",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",
                "From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.",
                "In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps.",

                "The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads).",
                "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",
                "These also hold for the Agent teams (upper one in Fig. 4).",

                "In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team members mental model (beliefs).",
                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",
                "Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).",
                "However, splitting multi-party messages by receivers loads does enhance subgroup SMMs.",
                "In Fig. 6 we plotted the other two measures of SMMs (distance and closeness as defined in Sec. 4.3).",
                "For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team).",
                "Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of other types.",
                "For agent teams, TH3>TH1>TH2 holds in Fig. 6(a), and TH2<TH3<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(b).",
                "Thus, agent teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had much higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of type 1 (although slightly worse than team type 2).",
                "Hence, generally, multi-party communication encourages the forming/evolving of team SMMs.",

                "For the HAP teams with load displays there is a strong negative linear relationship between info-sharing utility and cognitive load levels (Pearson correlation coefficient is − √ 0.899 = −0.948 with P-Value = 0.014).",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",

                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",

                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",
                "From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.",
                "In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps.",

                "The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads).",
                "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",
                "These also hold for the Agent teams (upper one in Fig. 4).",

                "In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team members mental model (beliefs).",
                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",
                "Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).",
                "However, splitting multi-party messages by receivers loads does enhance subgroup SMMs.",
                "In Fig. 6 we plotted the other two measures of SMMs (distance and closeness as defined in Sec. 4.3).",
                "For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team).",
                "Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of other types.",
                "For agent teams, TH3>TH1>TH2 holds in Fig. 6(a), and TH2<TH3<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(b).",

                "Human-centered multiagent teamwork has thus attracted increasing attentions in multi-agent systems field [2, 10, 4].",
                "Humans and autonomous systems (agents) are generally thought to be complementary: while humans are limited by their cognitive capacity in information processing, they are superior in spatial, heuristic, and analogical reasoning; autonomous systems can continuously learn expertise and tacit problem-solving knowledge from humans to improve system performance.",
                "In short, humans and agents can team together to achieve better performance, given that they could establish certain mutual awareness to coordinate their mixed-initiative activities.",
                "However, the foundation of human-agent collaboration keeps being challenged because of nonrealistic modeling of mutual awareness of the state of affairs.",
                "In particular, few researchers look beyond to assess the principles of modeling shared mental constructs between a human and his/her assisting agent.",
                "Moreover, human-agent relationships can go beyond partners to teams.",
                "Many informational processing limitations of individuals can be alleviated by having a group perform tasks.",
                "Although groups also can create additional costs centered on communication, resolution of conflict, and social acceptance, it is suggested that such limitations can be overcome if people have shared cognitive structures for interpreting task and social requirements [8].",
                "Therefore, there is a clear demand for investigations to broaden and deepen our understanding on the principles of shared mental modeling among members of a mixed human-agent team.",
                "There are lines of research on multi-agent teamwork, both theoretically and empirically.",
                "For instance, Joint Intention [3] and SharedPlans [5] are two theoretical frameworks for specifying agent collaborations.",
                "One of the drawbacks is that, although both have a deep philosophical and cognitive root, they do not accommodate the modeling of human team members.",
                "Cognitive studies suggested that teams which have shared mental models are expected to have common expectations of the task and team, which allow them to predict the behavior and resource needs of team members more accurately [14, 6].",
                "Cannon-Bowers et al. [14] explicitly argue that team members should hold compatible models that lead to common expectations.",
                "We agree on this and believe that the establishment of shared expectations among human and agent team members is a critical step to advance human-centered teamwork research.",
                "It has to be noted that the concept of shared expectation can broadly include role assignment and its dynamics, <br>teamwork schema</br>s and progresses, communication patterns and intentions, etc.",
                "While the long-term goal of our research is to understand how shared cognitive structures can enhance human-agent team performance, the specific objective of the work reported here is to develop a computational cognitive 395 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS capacity model to facilitate the establishment of shared expectations.",
                "In particular, we argue that to favor humanagent collaboration, an agent system should be designed to allow the estimation and prediction of human teammates (relative) cognitive loads, and use that to offer improvised, unintrusive help.",
                "Ideally, being able to predict the cognitive/processing capacity curves of teammates could allow a team member to help the right party at the right time, avoiding unbalanced work/cognitive loads among the team.",
                "The last point is on the modeling itself.",
                "Although an agents cognitive model of its human peer is not necessarily to be descriptively accurate, having at least a realistic model can be beneficial in offering unintrusive help, bias reduction, as well as trustable and self-adjustable autonomy.",
                "For example, although humans use of cognitive simplification mechanisms (e.g., heuristics) does not always lead to errors in judgment, it can lead to predictable biases in responses [8].",
                "It is feasible to develop agents as cognitive aids to alleviate humans biases, as long as an agent can be trained to obtain a model of a humans cognitive inclination.",
                "With a realistic human cognitive model, an agent can also better adjust its automation level.",
                "When its human peer is becoming overloaded, an agent can take over resource-consuming tasks, shifting the humans limited cognitive resources to tasks where a humans role is indispensable.",
                "When its human peer is underloaded, an agent can take the chance to observe the humans operations to refine its cognitive model of the human.",
                "Many studies have documented that human choices and behaviors do not agree with predictions from rational models.",
                "If agents could make recommendations in ways that humans appreciate, it would be easier to establish trust relationships between agents and humans; this in turn, will encourage humans automation uses.",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2 we review cognitive load theories and measurements.",
                "A HMM-based cognitive load model is given in Section 3 to support resource-bounded teamwork among human-agentpairs.",
                "Section 4 describes the key concept shared belief map as implemented in SMMall, and Section 5 reports the experiments for evaluating the cognitive models and their impacts on the evolving of shared mental models. 2.",
                "COGNITIVE CAPACITY-OVERVIEW People are information processors.",
                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "HUMAN-CENTERED TEAMWORK MODEL People are limited information processors, and so are intelligent agent systems; this is especially true when they act under hard or soft timing constraints imposed by the domain problems.",
                "In respect to our goal to build realistic expectations among teammates, we take two important steps.",
                "First, agents are resource-bounded; their processing capacity is limited by computing resources, inference knowledge, concurrent tasking capability, etc.",
                "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
                "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",
                "Taking this approach will largely change the way in which an agent views (models) the involvement and cooperativeness of its teammates in a team activity.",
                "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",
                "This being said, we are not dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable.",
                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",
                "Second, human teammates are bounded by their cognitive capacities.",
                "As far as we know, the research reported here is the first attempt in the area of humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers building and using humans cognitive load model to facilitate teamwork involving both humans and agents.",
                "We use Hi, Ai to denote Human-Agent-Pair (HAP) i. 3.1 Computational Cognitive Capacity Model An intelligent agent being a cognitive aid, it is desirable that the model of its human partner implemented within the agent is cognitively-acceptable, if not descriptively accurate.",
                "Of course, building a cognitive load model that is cognitively-acceptable is not trivial; there exist a variety of cognitive load theories and different measuring techniques.",
                "We here choose to focus on the performance variables of secondary tasks, given the ample evidence supporting secondary task performance as a highly sensitive and reliable technique for measuring humans cognitive load [12].",
                "Its worth noting that just for the purpose of estimating a human subjects cognitive load, any artificial task (e.g, pressing a button in response to unpredictable stimuli) can be used as a secondary task to force the subject to go through.",
                "However, in a realistic application, we have to make sure that the selected secondary task interacts with the primary task in meaningful ways, which is not easy and often depends on the domain problem at hand.",

                "In the following, we adopt the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach [13] to model humans cognitive capacity.",
                "It is thus assumed that at each time step the secondary task performance of a human subject in a team composed of human-agent-pairs (HAP) is observable to all the team members.",
                "Human team members secondary task performance is used for estimating their hidden cognitive loads.",

                "We consider a 5-state HMM model of human cognitive load as follows (Figure 2).",
                "The hidden states are 0 (negligiblyloaded), 1 (slightly-loaded), 2 (fairly-loaded), 3 (heavilyloaded), and 4 (overly loaded).",
                "The observable states are tied with secondary task performance, which, in this study, is measured in terms of the number of items correctly recalled.",
                "According to Millers 7±2 rule, the observable states take integer values from 0 to 9 ( the state is 9 when the number of items correctly recalled is no less than 9).",
                "For the example B Matrix given in Fig. 2, it is very likely that the cognitive load of the subject is negligibly when the number of items correctly recalled is larger than 9.",
                "However, to determine the current hidden load status of a human partner is not trivial.",
                "The model might be oversensitive if we only consider the last-step secondary task performance to locate the most likely hidden state.",
                "There is ample evidence suggesting that human cognitive load is a continuous function over time and does not manifest sudden shifts unless there is a fundamental changes in tasking demands.",
                "To address this issue, we place a constraint on the state transition coefficients: no jumps of more than 2 states are allowed.",
                "In addition, we take the position that, a human subject is very likely overloaded if his secondary task performance is mostly low in recent time steps, while he is very likely not overloaded if his secondary task performance is mostly high recently.",

First apply the HMM to the observation sequence to find the optimal sequence of hidden states Sλ t = s1s2 · · · sw (Viterbi algorithm).",

                "With the 5 hidden states similar to the HMM models adopted for human cognitive load, we employed multivariate Gaussian observation probability distributions for the hidden states. 3.3 HAPs Processing Load Model As discussed above, a Human-Agent-Pair (HAP) is viewed as a unit when teaming up with other HAPs.",
                "The processing load of a HAP can thus be modeled as the co-effect of the processing load of the agent and the cognitive load of the human partner as captured by the agent.",

                "The goal is to use the model to enhance information sharing performance so that a team can form better shared mental models (e.g., to develop inter-agent role expectations in their collaboration), which is the key to high team performance. 3.4 Load-Sensitive Information Processing Each agent has to adopt a certain strategy to process the incoming information.",
                "As far as resource-bounded agents are concerned, it is of no use for an agent to share information with teammates who are already overloaded; they simply do not have the capacity to process the information.",

                "To further encourage sharing information at the right time, the last row of Table 1 says that HAPi , if having not sent information to HAPj who is currently overloaded, will process all the information from HAPj .",
                "This can be justified from resource allocation perspective: an agent can reallocate its computing resource reserved for communication to enhance its capacity of processing information.",
                "This strategy favors never sending information to an overloaded teammate, and it suggests that estimating and exploiting others loads can be critical to enable an agent to share the right information with the right party at the right time. 4.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",
                "From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.",

                "The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads).",
                "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",

                "In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team members mental model (beliefs).",
                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",
                "Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).",

                "In Fig. 6 we plotted the other two measures of SMMs (distance and closeness as defined in Sec. 4.3).",
                "For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team).",
                "Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of other types.",
                "For agent teams, TH3>TH1>TH2 holds in Fig. 6(a), and TH2<TH3<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(b).",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
                "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",
                "Taking this approach will largely change the way in which an agent views (models) the involvement and cooperativeness of its teammates in a team activity.",
                "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",
                "This being said, we are not dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable.",
                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",

                "Secondary task performance at step t is thus measured as the number of cells marked (remembered) correctly at t, which is taken as the observable state of the HMMbased cognitive load model of that human subject.",
                "The primary task of a human subject is to build a shared mental model of the dynamic situation by sharing the right information with the right party at the right time.",
                "To share the information associated with an info-cell, a human subject needs to click the right mouse button on the cell, and select the receiving teammate(s) from the popup menu.",
                "There are costs associated with information sharing.",
                "Communications among HAPs is done by the corresponding SMMall agents, which have both limited capacity nin for processing incoming information and limited outgoing communication capacity nout.",

                "Sending information to an overloaded teammate will waste the capacity that otherwise can be used to share information with a less loaded teammate.",
                "This means that at each time step a human subject has to carefully go through three cognitive decisions: whether the information under consideration needs to be shared (i.e., whether it is associated with an info-cell just flashed), whether a team member is the right party to share the information with (i.e., whether it really needs the information), and whether this is the right time to share (i.e., whether the team member is currently overloaded).",

                "To get insights on how load predictions and multi-party communication may affect the performance of forming SMM, we designed 3 Agent teams (TA1, TA2, TA3) and 3 HAP teams (TH1, TH2, TH3), where all agents adopt the strategy in Table 1 to send and process information.",
                "When sharing information, teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) ignore load predictions; teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2) consider load predictions; teams of type 3 (TA3, TH3) follow load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents will further group the receivers of a multi-party message (MInform) by their loads and split the message into multiple messages with their receivers having the same load.",
                "For example, given that agents A1, A2, A3 have load 1, 2, 1, respectively.",
                "An agent A0 in a team of TA2 may send one multi-party message, while an agent A0 in a team of TA3 will send two messages (one to A2, one to A1 and A3).",
                "In addition, we controlled agents outgoing communication capacities by varying from 6, 8, to 10.",
                "Due to constraints on communication capacity and processing capacity, an agent can be inaccurate when tracking other teammates mental models.",
                "In order to measure the actual shared mental models, a special SMMall agent named OmniAll was added to each team to monitor inter-agent communications and record the actual effects of information sharing on each agents mental model.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",
                "From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.",
                "In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps.",
                "However, to maintain a SMM steadily at a certain level is a non-trivial team task.",
                "The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads).",
                "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",

                "In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team members mental model (beliefs).",
                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",
                "Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).",
                "However, splitting multi-party messages by receivers loads does enhance subgroup SMMs.",
                "In Fig. 6 we plotted the other two measures of SMMs (distance and closeness as defined in Sec. 4.3).",
                "For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team).",
                "Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of other types.",
                "For agent teams, TH3>TH1>TH2 holds in Fig. 6(a), and TH2<TH3<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(b).",

                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the <br>cognitive load theory</br> [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
                "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",

                "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",

                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",

                "As far as we know, the research reported here is the first attempt in the area of humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers building and using humans cognitive load model to facilitate teamwork involving both humans and agents.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",

                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance <br>human performance</br>.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
                "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",
                "Taking this approach will largely change the way in which an agent views (models) the involvement and cooperativeness of its teammates in a team activity.",
                "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",
                "This being said, we are not dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable.",
                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",
                "Second, human teammates are bounded by their cognitive capacities.",
                "As far as we know, the research reported here is the first attempt in the area of humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers building and using humans cognitive load model to facilitate teamwork involving both humans and agents.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",

                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the <br>resource allocation</br> perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
                "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",
                "Taking this approach will largely change the way in which an agent views (models) the involvement and cooperativeness of its teammates in a team activity.",
                "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",
                "This being said, we are not dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable.",
                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",

                "As far as we know, the research reported here is the first attempt in the area of humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers building and using humans cognitive load model to facilitate teamwork involving both humans and agents.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",

                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary <br>task performance</br>: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary <br>task performance</br> drops.",

                "However, one important drawback of secondary <br>task performance</br>, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",

                "Consider teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) and teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2).",
                "First look at the performance of HAP teams in Fig. 4, we have: (1) For each team type, the performance (percentage of SMM overtime) averaged over 10 teams increased as communication capacity increased (TH1-6<TH18<TH1-10, TH2-6<TH2-8<TH2-10). (2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",
                "From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.",
                "In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps.",
                "However, to maintain a SMM steadily at a certain level is a non-trivial team task.",
                "The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads).",
                "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",
                "These also hold for the Agent teams (upper one in Fig. 4).",
                "Actually, the performance of type 3 (a) (b) A B C MInform I A B C Inform I Inform I Inform I Figure 5: Multi-party messages. agent teams was even worse (for each fixed capacity) than the performance of type 1 agent teams.",
                "This can be explained by the difference of two-party and multi-party communications.",
                "In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team members mental model (beliefs).",
                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",
                "Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).",
                "However, splitting multi-party messages by receivers loads does enhance subgroup SMMs.",
                "In Fig. 6 we plotted the other two measures of SMMs (distance and closeness as defined in Sec. 4.3).",
                "For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team).",
                "Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of other types.",
                "For agent teams, TH3>TH1>TH2 holds in Fig. 6(a), and TH2<TH3<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(b).",
                "Thus, agent teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had much higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of type 1 (although slightly worse than team type 2).",
                "Hence, generally, multi-party communication encourages the forming/evolving of team SMMs.",
                "When a group of agents can be partitioned into subteams, splitting messages by their loads can be more effective for subteam SMMs. 5.5 The HMM-based Cognitive Model To validate the HMM-based cognitive load model is extremely difficult because detecting the real, noise-resistant cognitive load of human beings is far beyond the current technology.",
                "As an indirect judgment, we plotted the regression fitted lines for the means of information sharing utility of HAP teams with and without load displays.",
                "For the HAP teams with load displays there is a strong negative linear relationship between info-sharing utility and cognitive load levels (Pearson correlation coefficient is − √ 0.899 = −0.948 with P-Value = 0.014).",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",

                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",

                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",

                "When sharing information, teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) ignore load predictions; teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2) consider load predictions; teams of type 3 (TA3, TH3) follow load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents will further group the receivers of a multi-party message (MInform) by their loads and split the message into multiple messages with their receivers having the same load.",
                "For example, given that agents A1, A2, A3 have load 1, 2, 1, respectively.",
                "An agent A0 in a team of TA2 may send one multi-party message, while an agent A0 in a team of TA3 will send two messages (one to A2, one to A1 and A3).",
                "In addition, we controlled agents outgoing communication capacities by varying from 6, 8, to 10.",
                "Due to constraints on communication capacity and processing capacity, an agent can be inaccurate when tracking other teammates mental models.",
                "In order to measure the actual shared mental models, a special SMMall agent named OmniAll was added to each team to monitor inter-agent communications and record the actual effects of information sharing on each agents mental model.",

                "First look at the performance of HAP teams in Fig. 4, we have: (1) For each team type, the performance (percentage of SMM overtime) averaged over 10 teams increased as communication capacity increased (TH1-6<TH18<TH1-10, TH2-6<TH2-8<TH2-10). (2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",
                "From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.",
                "In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps.",
                "However, to maintain a SMM steadily at a certain level is a non-trivial team task.",
                "The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads).",
                "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",
                "These also hold for the Agent teams (upper one in Fig. 4).",

                "This can be explained by the difference of two-party and multi-party communications.",
                "In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team members mental model (beliefs).",
                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",
                "Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).",
                "However, splitting multi-party messages by receivers loads does enhance subgroup SMMs.",
                "In Fig. 6 we plotted the other two measures of SMMs (distance and closeness as defined in Sec. 4.3).",
                "For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team).",
                "Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of other types.",
                "For agent teams, TH3>TH1>TH2 holds in Fig. 6(a), and TH2<TH3<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(b).",
                "Thus, agent teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had much higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of type 1 (although slightly worse than team type 2).",
                "Hence, generally, multi-party communication encourages the forming/evolving of team SMMs.",

                "For the HAP teams with load displays there is a strong negative linear relationship between <br>info-sharing</br> utility and cognitive load levels (Pearson correlation coefficient is − √ 0.899 = −0.948 with P-Value = 0.014).",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",

                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",

                "Secondary task performance at step t is thus measured as the number of cells marked (remembered) correctly at t, which is taken as the observable state of the HMMbased cognitive load model of that human subject.",
                "The primary task of a human subject is to build a shared mental model of the dynamic situation by sharing the right information with the right party at the right time.",
                "To share the information associated with an info-cell, a human subject needs to click the right mouse button on the cell, and select the receiving teammate(s) from the popup menu.",

                "This means that at each time step a human subject has to carefully go through three cognitive decisions: whether the information under consideration needs to be shared (i.e., whether it is associated with an info-cell just flashed), whether a team member is the right party to share the information with (i.e., whether it really needs the information), and whether this is the right time to share (i.e., whether the team member is currently overloaded).",

                "To get insights on how load predictions and <br>multi-party communication</br> may affect the performance of forming SMM, we designed 3 Agent teams (TA1, TA2, TA3) and 3 HAP teams (TH1, TH2, TH3), where all agents adopt the strategy in Table 1 to send and process information.",
                "When sharing information, teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) ignore load predictions; teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2) consider load predictions; teams of type 3 (TA3, TH3) follow load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents will further group the receivers of a multi-party message (MInform) by their loads and split the message into multiple messages with their receivers having the same load.",
                "For example, given that agents A1, A2, A3 have load 1, 2, 1, respectively.",
                "An agent A0 in a team of TA2 may send one multi-party message, while an agent A0 in a team of TA3 will send two messages (one to A2, one to A1 and A3).",
                "In addition, we controlled agents outgoing communication capacities by varying from 6, 8, to 10.",
                "Due to constraints on communication capacity and processing capacity, an agent can be inaccurate when tracking other teammates mental models.",
                "In order to measure the actual shared mental models, a special SMMall agent named OmniAll was added to each team to monitor inter-agent communications and record the actual effects of information sharing on each agents mental model.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",

                "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",

                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
                "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",

                "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",

                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",

                "The primary task of a human subject is to build a shared mental model of the dynamic situation by sharing the right information with the right party at the right time.",
                "To share the information associated with an info-cell, a human subject needs to click the right mouse button on the cell, and select the receiving teammate(s) from the popup menu.",
                "There are costs associated with information sharing.",
                "Communications among HAPs is done by the corresponding SMMall agents, which have both limited capacity nin for processing incoming information and limited outgoing communication capacity nout.",

                "Sending information to an overloaded teammate will waste the capacity that otherwise can be used to share information with a less loaded teammate.",
                "This means that at each time step a human subject has to carefully go through three cognitive decisions: whether the information under consideration needs to be shared (i.e., whether it is associated with an info-cell just flashed), whether a team member is the right party to share the information with (i.e., whether it really needs the information), and whether this is the right time to share (i.e., whether the team member is currently overloaded).",

                "To get insights on how load predictions and multi-party communication may affect the performance of forming SMM, we designed 3 Agent teams (TA1, TA2, TA3) and 3 HAP teams (TH1, TH2, TH3), where all agents adopt the strategy in Table 1 to send and process information.",
                "When sharing information, teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) ignore load predictions; teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2) consider load predictions; teams of type 3 (TA3, TH3) follow load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents will further group the receivers of a multi-party message (MInform) by their loads and split the message into multiple messages with their receivers having the same load.",
                "For example, given that agents A1, A2, A3 have load 1, 2, 1, respectively.",
                "An agent A0 in a team of TA2 may send one multi-party message, while an agent A0 in a team of TA3 will send two messages (one to A2, one to A1 and A3).",
                "In addition, we controlled agents outgoing communication capacities by varying from 6, 8, to 10.",
                "Due to constraints on communication capacity and processing capacity, an agent can be inaccurate when tracking other teammates mental models.",
                "In order to measure the actual shared mental models, a special SMMall agent named OmniAll was added to each team to monitor inter-agent communications and record the actual effects of information sharing on each agents mental model.",

                "First look at the performance of HAP teams in Fig. 4, we have: (1) For each team type, the performance (percentage of SMM overtime) averaged over 10 teams increased as communication capacity increased (TH1-6<TH18<TH1-10, TH2-6<TH2-8<TH2-10). (2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
                "This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.",
                "From Fig. 4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.",
                "In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps.",
                "However, to maintain a SMM steadily at a certain level is a non-trivial team task.",
                "The performance of teams who did not share any information (the NoSharing curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded. 5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers loads).",
                "As plotted in Fig. 4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as communication capacity increased.",

                "In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team members mental model (beliefs).",
                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",
                "Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).",

                "For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d) (smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole team).",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
                "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",
                "Taking this approach will largely change the way in which an agent views (models) the involvement and cooperativeness of its teammates in a team activity.",
                "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",
                "This being said, we are not dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable.",
                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",
                "Second, human teammates are bounded by their cognitive capacities.",
                "As far as we know, the research reported here is the first attempt in the area of humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers building and using humans cognitive load model to facilitate teamwork involving both humans and agents.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",

                "According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the senders and all the other receivers beliefs.",
                "Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.",
                "As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It consumes 2 of As communication resources, one for each receiver).",
                "However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others efforts).",

                "Humans and autonomous systems (agents) are generally thought to be complementary: while humans are limited by their cognitive capacity in information processing, they are superior in spatial, heuristic, and analogical reasoning; autonomous systems can continuously learn expertise and tacit problem-solving knowledge from humans to improve system performance.",

                "Although groups also can create additional costs centered on communication, resolution of conflict, and social acceptance, it is suggested that such limitations can be overcome if people have shared cognitive structures for interpreting task and social requirements [8].",

                "Most cognitive scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.",
                "Cognitive load studies are, by and large, concerned about working memory capacity and how to circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.",
                "According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.",
                "It has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task (e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g. noise), and their mutual relations.",
                "It also has an assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually allocated to the task), and performance.",
                "Langs information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
                "The encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a persons goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded information into chunks, and form associations and schema to facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.",
                "The model suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are independently allocated to the three processes.",
                "In addition, working memory is used both for holding and for processing information [1].",
                "Due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity remains for the storage of information.",
                "Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in order to enhance human performance.",
                "This comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.",
                "Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales, psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].",
                "Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.",
                "Although physiological measures are sometimes highly sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.",
                "Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].",
                "From the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the secondary task [7].",
                "Consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.",
                "The level of cognitive load can thus be manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.",
                "A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.",
                "Its performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.",
                "However, one important drawback of secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.",
                "To better understand and measure cognitive load, Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, accumulated load, average load, and overall load.",
                "It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations. 396 The Sixth Intl.",

                "We withdraw the assumption that an agent knows all the information/intentions communicated from other teammates.",
                "Instead, we contend that due to limited processing capacity, an agent may only have opportunities to process (make sense of) a portion of the incoming information, with the rest ignored.",
                "Taking this approach will largely change the way in which an agent views (models) the involvement and cooperativeness of its teammates in a team activity.",
                "In other words, the establishment of shared mental models regarding team members beliefs, intentions, and responsibilities can no longer rely on inter-agent communication only.",
                "This being said, we are not dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable.",
                "We still stick to this, only that team members cannot overtrust each other; an agent has to consider the possibility that its information being shared with others might not be as effective as expected due to the recipients limited processing capacities.",
                "Second, human teammates are bounded by their cognitive capacities.",
                "As far as we know, the research reported here is the first attempt in the area of humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers building and using humans cognitive load model to facilitate teamwork involving both humans and agents.",

(2) The averaged performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.",
