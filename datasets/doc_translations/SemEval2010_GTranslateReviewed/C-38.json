PRO is designed for non-interactive streaming applications and its primary design goal is to maximize delivered bandwidth (and thus delivered quality) to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth. To achieve this goal, PRO adopts a receiver-driven approach where each receiver (or participating peer) (i) independently discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and (ii) selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own delivered bandwidth. Participating peers form an unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to high churn rate. Furthermore, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as implicit signal to detect and react to long-term changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers. Independent parent selection by individual peers dynamically converge to an efficient overlay structure.

INTRODUCTION Limited deployment of IP multicast has motivated a new distribution paradigm over the Internet based on overlay networks where a group of participating end-systems (or peers) form an overlay structure and actively participate in distribution of content without any special support from the network (e.g., [7]). Since overlay structures are layered over the best-effort Internet, any approach for constructing overlay should address the following fundamental challenges: (i) Scalability with the number of participating peers, (ii) Robustness to dynamics of peer participation, (iii) Adaptation to variations of network bandwidth, and (iv) Accommodating heterogeneity and asymmetry of bandwidth connectivity among participating peers[19]. Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay. This paper presents a simple framework for architecting Peer-to-peer Receiver-driven Overlay, called PRO. PRO can accommodate a spectrum of non-interactive streaming applications ranging from playback to lecture-mode live sessions. The main design philosophy in PRO is that each peer should be allowed to independently and selfishly determine the best way to connect to the overlay in order to maximize its own delivered quality. Toward this end, each peer can connect to the overlay topology at multiple points (i.e., receive content through multiple parent peers). Therefore, participating peers form an unstructured overlay that can gracefully cope with high churn rate[5]. Furthermore, having multiple parent peers accommodates bandwidth heterogeneity and asymmetry while improves resiliency against dynamics of peer participation. PRO consists of two key components: (i) Gossip-based Peer Discovery: Each peer periodically exchanges message (i.e., gossips) with other known peers to progressively learn about a subset of participating peers in the overlay that are likely to be good parents. Gossiping provides a scalable and efficient approach to peer discovery in unstructured peer-to-peer networks that can be customized to guide direction of discovery towards peers with desired properties (e.g., peers with shorter distance or higher bandwidth). (ii) Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver. Since the available bandwidth from different participating peers to a receiver (and possible correlation among them) can be measured only at that receiver, a receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers. Furthermore, the available bandwidth from parent peers serves as an implicit signal for a receiver to detect and react to changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers. Independent parent selection by individual peers leads to an efficient overlay that maximizes delivered quality to each peer. PRO incorporates 42 several damping functions to ensure stability of the overlay despite uncoordinated actions by different peers. PRO is part of a larger architecture that we have developed for peer-to-peer streaming. In our earlier work, we developed a mechanism called PALS [18] that enables a receiver to stream layered structured content from a given set of congestion controlled senders. Thus, PRO and PALS are both receiver-driven but complement each other. More specifically, PRO determines a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize delivered bandwidth to each receiver whereas PALS coordinates in-time streaming of different segments of multimedia content from these parents despite unpredictable variations in their available bandwidth. This division of functionality provides a great deal of flexibility because it decouples overlay construction from delivery mechanism. In this paper, we primarily focus on the overlay construction mechanism, or PRO. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we revisit the problem of overlay construction for peerto-peer streaming and identify its two key components and explore their design space. We illustrate the differences between PRO and previous solutions, and justify our design choices. We present our proposed framework in Section 3. In Sections 4 and 5, the key components of our framework are described in further detail. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and presents our future plans. 2. REVISITING THE PROBLEM Constructing a peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications should not only accommodate global design goals such as scalability and resilience but also satisfy the local design goal of maximizing delivered quality to individual peers 1 . More specifically, delivered quality of streaming content to each peer should be proportional to its incoming access link bandwidth. Achieving these goals is particularly challenging because participating peers often exhibit heterogeneity and asymmetry in their bandwidth connectivity. Solutions for constructing peer-to-peer overlays often require two key mechanisms to be implemented at each peer: Peer Discovery (PD) and Parent Selection (PS). The PD mechanism enables each peer to learn about other participating peers in the overlay. Information about other peers are used by the PS mechanism at each peer to determine proper parent peers through which it should connect to the overlay. The collective behavior of PD and PS mechanisms at all participating peers leads to an overlay structure that achieves the above design goals. There has been a wealth of previous research that explored design space of the PD and PS mechanisms as follows: Peer Discovery: In structured peer-to-peer networks, the existing structure enables each peer to find other participating peers in a scalable fashion (e.g., [4]). However, structured peer-to-peer networks may not be robust against high churn rate [5]. In contrast, unstructured peer-to-peer networks can gracefully accommodate high churn rate [5] but require a separate peer discovery mechanism. Meshfirst approaches (e.g., [7, 6]) that require each peer to know about all other participating peers as well as centralized approaches (e.g., [16]) to peer discovery exhibit limited scalability. NICE [2] leverages a hierarchal structure to achieve 1 It is worth clarifying that our design goal is different from common goals in building application-level multicast trees [7] (i.e., minimizing stretch and stress). scalability but each peer only knows about a group of closeby peers who may not be good parents (i.e., may not provide sufficient bandwidth). Parent Selection: We examine two key aspects of parent selections: (i) Selection Criteria: There are two main criteria for parent selections: relative delay and available bandwidth between two peers. Relative delay between any two peers can be estimated in a scalable fashion with one of the existing landmark-based solutions such as Global Network Positioning (GNP) [15]. However, estimating available bandwidth between two peers requires end-to-end measurement. Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons: First, to cope with dynamics of bandwidth variations, each peer requires to periodically estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through measurement (e.g., [6]). Second, the probability of interference among different measurements grows with the number of peers in an overlay (similar to joint experiment in RLM [13]). Most of the previous solutions adopted the idea of application level multicast and used delay as the main selection criteria. Participating peers cooperatively run a distributed algorithm to organize themselves into a source-rooted tree structure in order to minimize either overall delay across all branches of the tree (e.g., [7]), or delay between source and each receiver peer (e.g., [20]). While these parent selection strategies minimize associated network load, they may not provide sufficient bandwidth to individual peers because delay is often not a good indicator for available bandwidth between two peers [12, 14]. The key issue is that minimizing overall delay (global design goal) and maximizing delivered bandwidth to each peer (local design goal) could easily be in conflict. More specifically, parent peers with longer relative distance may provide higher bandwidth than close-by parents. This suggests that there might exist a tradeoff between maximizing provided bandwidth to each peer and minimizing overall delay across the overlay. (ii) Single vs Multiple Parents: A single tree structure for the overlay (where each peer has a single parent) is inherently unable to accommodate peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth. A common approach to accommodating bandwidth heterogeneity is to use layer structured content (either layered or multiple description encodings) and allow each receiver to have multiple parents. This approach could accommodate heterogeneity but it introduces several new challenges. First, parent selection strategy should be determined based on location of a bottleneck. If the bottleneck is at the (outgoing) access links of parent peers 2 , then a receiver should simply look for more parents. However, when the bottleneck is else where in the network, a receiver should select parents with a diverse set of paths (i.e., utilize different network paths). In practice, a combination of these cases might simultaneously exist among participating peers [1]. Second, streaming a single content from multiple senders is challenging for two reasons: 1) This requires tight coordination among senders to determine overall delivered quality (e.g., number of layers) and decide which sender is responsible for delivery of each segment. 2) Delivered segments from different senders should arrive before their playout times despite uncorrelated vari2 if bottleneck is at the receivers access link, then provided bandwidth to the receiver is already maximized. 43 ations in (congestion controlled) bandwidth from different senders. This also implies that those solutions that build multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure in-time delivery of individual segments (e.g., [3, 11]) may not be able to support streaming applications. One approach to build a multi-parent overlay is to organize participating peers into different trees where each layer of the stream is sent to a separate tree (e.g., [4, 16]). Each peer can maximize its quality by participating in a proper number of trees. This approach raises several issues: 1) the provided bandwidth to peers in each tree is limited by minimum uplink bandwidth among upstream peers on that tree. In the presence of bandwidth asymmetry, this could easily limit delivered bandwidth on each tree below the required bandwidth for a single layer, 2) it is not feasible to build separate trees that are all optimal for a single selection criteria (e.g., overall delay),. 3) connections across different trees are likely to compete for available bandwidth on a single bottleneck3 . We conclude that a practical solution for peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following design properties: (i) it should use an unstructured, multiparent peer-to-peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver. In the next section, we explain how PRO incorporates all the above design properties. 3. P2P RECEIVER-DRIVEN OVERLAY Assumptions: We assume that each peer can estimate the relative distance between any two peers using the GNP mechanism [15]. Furthermore, each peer knows the incoming and outgoing bandwidth of its access link. Each peer uses the PALS mechanism to stream content from multiple parent peers. All connections are congestion controlled by senders (e.g., [17]). To accommodate peer bandwidth heterogeneity, we assume that the content has a layered representation. In other words, with proper adjustment, the framework should work with both layered and multipledescription encodings. Participating peers have heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth connectivity. Furthermore, peers may join and leave in an arbitrary fashion. Overview: In PRO, each peer (or receiver) progressively searches for a subset of parents that collectively maximize delivered bandwidth and minimize overall delay from all parents to the receiver. Such a subset of parents may change over time as some parents join (or leave) the overlay, or available bandwidth from current parents significantly changes. Note that each peer can be both receiver and parent at the same time 4 . Each receiver periodically exchanges messages (i.e., gossips) with other peers in the overlay to learn about those participating peers that are potentially good parents. Potentially good parents for a receiver are identified based on their relative utility for the receiver. The utility of a parent peer pi for a receiver pj is a function of their relative network distance (delij) and the outgoing access link bandwidth of the parent (outbwi), (i.e., U(pi, pj) 3 These multi-tree approaches often do not use congestion control for each connection. 4 Throughout this paper we use receiver and parent as short form for receiver peer and parent peer. = f(delij, outbwi)). Using parents access link bandwidth instead of available bandwidth has several advantages: (i) outgoing bandwidth is an upper bound for available bandwidth from a parent. Therefore, it enables the receiver to roughly classify different parents. (ii) estimating available bandwidth requires end-to-end measurement and such a solution does not scale with the number of peers, and more importantly, (iii) given a utility function, this approach enables any peer in the overlay to estimate relative utility of any other two peers. Each receiver only maintains information about a fixed (and relatively small) number of promising parent peers in its local image. The local image at each receiver is dynamically updated with new gossip messages as other peers join/leave the overlay. Each peer selects a new parent in a demand-driven fashion in order to minimize the number of end-to-end bandwidth measurements, and thus improve scalability. When a receiver needs a new parent, its PS mechanism randomly selects a peer from its local image where probability of selecting a peer directly depends on its utility. Then, the actual properties (i.e., available bandwidth and delay) of the selected parent are verified through passive measurement. Toward this end, the selected parent is added to the parent list which triggers PALS to request content from this parent. Figure 1 depicts the interactions between PD and PS mechanisms. In PRO, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as an implicit signal to detect two events: (i) any measurable shared bottleneck among connections from different parents, and (ii) any change in network or overlay conditions (e.g., departure or arrival of other close-by peers). Figure 2 shows part of an overlay to illustrate this feature. Each receiver continuously monitors available bandwidth from all its parents. Receiver p0 initially has only p1 as a parent. When p0 adds a new parent (p2), the receiver examines the smoothed available bandwidth from p1 and p2 and any measurable correlation between them. If the available bandwidth from p1 decreases after p2 is added, the receiver can conclude that these two parents are behind the same bottleneck (i.e., link L0). We note that paths from two parents might have some overlap that does not include any bottleneck. Assume another receiver p3 selects p1 as a parent and thus competes with receiver p0 for available bandwidth on link L1. Suppose that L1 becomes a bottleneck and the connection between p1 to p3 obtains a significantly higher share of L1s bandwidth than connection between p1 to p0. This change in available bandwidth from p1 serves as a signal for p0. Whenever a receiver detects such a drop in bandwidth, it waits for a random period of time (proportional to the available bandwidth) and then drops Source Peer Disc.

Therefore, the receiver with a higher bandwidth connectivity (p3) is more likely to keep p1 as parent whereas p0 may examine other parents with higher bandwidth including p3. The congestion controlled bandwidth signals the receiver to properly reshape the overlay. We present a summary of key features and limitations of PRO in the next two sections. Table 1 summarizes our notation throughout this paper. Main Features: Gossiping provides a scalable approach to peer discovery because each peer does not require global knowledge about all group members, and its generated traffic can be controlled. The PD mechanism actively participates in peer selection by identifying peers for the local image which limits the possible choices of parents for the PS mechanism. PRO constructs a multi-parent, unstructured overlay. But PRO does not have the same limitations that exist in multi-tree approaches because it allows each receiver to independently micro-manage its parents to maximize its overall bandwidth based on local information. PRO conducts passive measurement not only to determine available bandwidth from a parent but also to detect any shared bottleneck between paths from different parents. Furthermore, by selecting a new parent from the local image, PRO increases the probability of finding a good parent in each selection, and thus significantly decreases number of required measurements which in turn improves scalability. PRO can gracefully accommodate bandwidth heterogeneity and asymmetry among peers since PALS is able to manage delivery of content from a group of parents with different bandwidth. Limitations and Challenges: The main hypothesis in our framework is that the best subset of parents for each receiver are likely to be part of its local image i.e., PD mechanism can find the best parents. Whenever this condition is not satisfied, either a receiver may not be able to maximize its overall bandwidth or resulting overlay may not be efficient.

No of parents for pi nopi(t) No of active parents for pi at time t img sz Size of local image at each peer sgm Size of gossip message delij Estimated delay between pi and pj Clearly, properties of the selected utility function as well as accuracy of estimated parameters (in particular using outgoing bandwidth instead of available bandwidth) determine properties of the local image at each peer which in turn affects performance of the framework in some scenarios. In these cases, the utility value may not effectively guide the search process in identifying good parents which increases the average convergence time until each peer finds a good subset of parents. Similar to many other adaptive mechanisms (e.g., [13]), the parent selection mechanism should address the fundamental tradeoff between responsiveness and stability. Finally, the congestion controlled bandwidth from parent peers may not provide a measurable signal to detect a shared bottleneck when level of multiplexing is high at the bottleneck link. However, this is not a major limitation since the negative impact of a shared bottleneck in these cases is minimal. All the above limitations are in part due to the simplicity of our framework and would adversely affect its performance. However, we believe that this is a reasonable design tradeoff since simplicity is one of our key design goals. In the following sections, we describe the two key components of our framework in further details. 4. GOSSIP-BASED PEER DISCOVERY Peer discovery at each receiver is basically a search among all participating peers in the overlay for a certain number (img sz) of peers with the highest relative utility. PRO adopts a gossip-like [10] approach to peer discovery. Gossiping (or rumor spreading) has been frequently used as a scalable alternative to flooding that gradually spreads information among a group of peers.However, we use gossiping as a search mechanism [9] for finding promising parents since it has two appealing properties (i) the volume of exchanged messages can be controlled, and (ii) the gossip-based information exchange can be customized to leverage relative utility values to improve search efficiency. The gossip mechanism works as follow: each peer maintains a local image that contains up to img sz records where each record represents the following information for a previously discovered peer pi in the overlay: 1) IP address, 2) GNP coordinates, 3) number of received layers, 4) timestamp when the record was last generated by a peer, 5) outbwi and 6) inbwi. To bootstrap the discovery process, a new receiver needs to learn about a handful of other participating peers in the overlay. This information can be obtained from the original server (or a well-known rendezvous point). The server should implement a strategy for selecting the initial peers that are provided to each new receiver. We call this the initial parent selection mechanism. Once the initial set of peers are known, each peer pi periodically invokes a target selection mechanism to determine a target peer (pj) from its local image for gossip. Given a utility function, peer pi uses a content selection strategy to select sgm records (or smaller number when sgm records are not available) from its local image that are most useful for pj and send those records to pj. In response, pj follows the same steps and replies with a gossip message that includes sgm records from its local image that are most useful for pi, i.e., bidirectional gossip. When a gossip message arrives at each peer, an image maintenance scheme integrates new records into the current local image and discards excess records such that certain property of the local image is improved (e.g., increase overall utility of peers in the image) Aggregate performance of 45 a gossip mechanism can be presented by two average metrics and their distribution among peers: (i) Average Convergence Time: average number of gossip messages until all peers in an overlay reach their final images, and (ii) Average Efficiency Ratio: average ratio of unique records to the total number of received records by each peer. We have been exploring the design space of four key components of the gossip mechanism. Frequency and size of gossip messages determine average freshness of local images. Currently, the server randomly selects the initial parents from its local image for each new peer. Target Selection: Target selection randomly picks a peer from the current image to evenly obtain information from different areas of the overlay and speed up discovery. Content Selection: peer pk determines relative utility of all the peers (pj) in its local image for target peer pi, and then randomly selects sgm peers to prepare a gossip message for pi. However, probability of selecting a peer directly depends on its utility. This approach is biased towards peers with higher utility but its randomness tend to reduce number of duplicate records in different gossip message from one peer (i.e., improves efficiency). A potential drawback of this approach is the increase in convergence time. We plan to examine more efficient information sharing schemes such as bloom filters [3] in our future work. PRO uses joint-ranking [15] to determine relative utility of a parent for a receiver. Given a collection of peers in a local image of pk, the jointranking scheme ranks all the peers once based on their outgoing bandwidth, and then based on their estimated delay from a target peer pi. The utility of peer pj (U(pj, pi)) is inversely proportional to the sum of pjs ranks in both rankings. Values for each property (i.e., bandwidth and delay) of various peers are divided into multiple ranges (i.e., bins) where all peers within each range are assumed to have the same value for that property. This binning scheme minimizes the sensitivity to minor differences in delay or bandwidth among different peers. Image maintenance: Image maintenance mechanism evicts extra records (beyond img sz) that satisfy one of the following conditions: (i) represent peers with the lower utility, (ii) represent peers that were already dropped by the PS mechanism due to poor performance and (iii) have a timestamp older than a threshold. This approach attempts to balance image quality (in terms of overall utility of existing peers) and its freshness. Note that the gossip mechanism can discover any peer in the overlay as long as reachability is provided through overlap among local images at different peers. The higher the amount of overlap, the higher the efficiency of discovery, and the higher the robustness of the overlay to dynamics of peer participations. The amount of overlap among images depends on both the size and shape of the local images at each peer. The shape of the local image is a function of the deployed utility function. Joint-ranking utility gives the same weight to delay and bandwidth. Delay tends to bias selection towards near-by peers whereas outgoing bandwidth introduces some degree of randomness in location of selected peers. Therefore, the resulting local images should exhibit a sufficient degree of overlap. 5. PARENT SELECTION The PS mechanism at each peer is essentially a progressive search within the local image for a subset of parent peers such that the following design goals are achieved: (i) maximizing delivered bandwidth 5 , (ii) minimizing the total delay from all parents to the receiver, and (iii) maximizing diversity of paths from parents (whenever it is feasible). Whenever these goals are in conflict, a receiver optimizes the goal with the highest priority. Currently, our framework does not directly consider diversity of paths from different parents as a criteria for parent selection. However, the indirect effect of shared path among parents is addressed because of its potential impact on available bandwidth from a parent when two or more parents are behind the same bottleneck. The number of active parents (nopi(t)) for each receiver should be within a configured range [min nop, max nop]. Each receiver tries to maximize its delivered bandwidth with the minimum number of parents. If this goal can not be achieved after evaluation of a certain number of new parents, the receiver will gradually increase its number of parents. This flexibility is important in order to utilize available bandwidth from low bandwidth parents, i.e., cope with bandwidth heterogeneity. min nop determines minimum degree of resilience to parent departure, and minimum level of path diversity (whenever diverse paths are available). The number of children for each peer should not be limited. Instead, each peer only limits maximum outgoing bandwidth that it is able (or willing) to provide to its children. This allows child peers to compete for congestion controlled bandwidth from a parent which motivates child peers with poor bandwidth connectivity to look for other parents (i.e., properly reshape the overlay). Design of a PS mechanism should address three main questions as follows: 1) When should a new parent be selected? There is a fundamental tradeoff between responsiveness of a receiver to changes in network conditions (or convergence time after a change) and stability of the overlay. PRO adopts a conservative approach where each peer selects a new parent in a demand-driven fashion. This should significantly reduce number of new parent selections, which in turn improves scalability (by minimizing the interference caused by new connections) and stability of the overlay structure. A new parent is selected in the following scenarios: (i) Initial Phase: when a new peer joins the overlay, it periodically adds a new parent until it has min nop parents. (ii) Replacing a Poorly-Performing Parent: when available bandwidth from an existing parent is significantly reduced for a long time or a parent leaves the session, the receiver can select another peer after a random delay. Each receiver selects a random delay proportional to its available bandwidth from the parent peer [8]. This approach dampens potential oscillation in the overlay while increasing the chance for receivers with higher bandwidth connectivity to keep a parent (i.e., properly reshapes the overlay). (iii) Improvement in Performance: when it is likely that a new parent would significantly improve a non-optimized aspect of performance (increase the bandwidth or decrease the delay). This strategy allows gradual improvement of the parent subset as new peers are discovered (or joined) the overlay. The available information for each peer in the image is used as a heuristic to predict performance of a new peer. Such an improvement should be examined infrequently. A hysteresis mechanism 5 The target bandwidth is the lower value between maximum stream bandwidth and receivers incoming bandwidth. 46 is implemented in scenario (ii) and (iii) to dampen any potential oscillation in the overlay. 2) Which peer should be selected as a new parent? At any point of time, peers in the local image are the best known candidate peers to serve as parent. In PRO, each receiver randomly selects a parent from its current image where the probability of selecting a parent is proportional to its utility. Deploying this selection strategy by all peers lead to proportional utilization of outgoing bandwidth of all peers without making the selection heavily biased towards high bandwidth peers. This approach (similar to [5]) leverages heterogeneity among peers since number of children for each peer is proportional to its outgoing bandwidth. 3) How should a new parent be examined? Each receiver continuously monitors available bandwidth from all parents and potential correlation between bandwidth of two or more connections as signal for shared bottleneck. The degree of such correlation also reveals the level of multiplexing at the bottleneck link, and could serve as an indicator for separating remote bottlenecks from a local one. Such a monitoring should use average bandwidth of each flow over a relatively long time scale (e.g., hundreds of RTT) to filter out any transient variations in bandwidth. To avoid selecting a poorly-performing parent in the near future, the receiver associates a timer to each parent and exponentially backs off the timer after each failed experience [13]. After the initial phase, each receiver maintains a fixed number of parents at any point of time (nopi(t)). Thus, a new parent should replace one of the active parents. However, to ensure monotonic improvement in overall performance of active parents, a new parent is always added before one of the existing parents is dropped (i.e., a receiver can temporarily have one extra parent). Given the available bandwidth from all parents (including the new one) and possible correlation among them, a receiver can use one of the following criteria to drop a parent: (i) to maximize the bandwidth, the receiver can drop the parent that contributes minimum bandwidth, (ii) to maximize path diversity among connections from parents, the receiver should drop the parent that is located behind the same bottleneck with the largest number of active parents and contributes minimum bandwidth among them. Finally, if the aggregate bandwidth from all parents remains below the required bandwidth after examining certain number of new parents (and nopi(t) < max nop), the receiver can increase the total number of parents by one. 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we presented a simple receiver-driven framework for architecting peer-to-pee overlay structures called PRO. PRO allows each peer to selfishly and independently determine the best way to connect to the overlay to maximize its performance. Therefore, PRO should be able to maximize delivered quality to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth connectivity. Both peer discovery and peer selection in this framework are scalable. Furthermore, PRO uses congestion controlled bandwidth as an implicit signal to detect shared bottleneck among existing parents as well as changes in network or overlay conditions to properly reshape the structure. We described the basic framework and its key components, and sketched our strawman solutions. This is a starting point for our work on PRO. We are currently evaluating various aspects of this framework via simulation, and exploring the design space of key components. We are also prototyping this framework to conduct real-world experiments on the Planet-Lab in a near future. 7. REFERENCES [1] A. Akella, S. Seshan, and A. Shaikh.

Pro está diseñado para aplicaciones de transmisión no interactivas y su objetivo de diseño principal es maximizar el ancho de banda entregado (y por lo tanto entregado de calidad) a pares con ancho de banda heterogéneo y asimétrico. Para lograr este objetivo, Pro adopta un enfoque impulsado por el receptor donde cada receptor (o compañero participante) (i) descubre de forma independiente a otros pares en la superposición a través de los chismes, y (ii) determina egoístamente el mejor subconjunto de compañeros a través de los cuales conectarse ala superposición para maximizar su propio ancho de banda entregado. Los compañeros participantes forman una superposición no estructurada que es inherentemente robusta a la alta tasa de rotación. Además, cada receptor aprovecha el ancho de banda controlado por la congestión de sus padres como señal implícita para detectar y reaccionar a los cambios a largo plazo en la red o la condición de superposición sin ninguna coordinación explícita con otros pares participantes. La selección independiente de los padres por pares individuales convergen dinámicamente a una estructura de superposición eficiente. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos: C.2.4 [Redes de Computercommunications]: Sistemas distribuidos Términos generales: Diseño, Medición 1. Introducción El despliegue limitado de la multidifusión IP ha motivado un nuevo paradigma de distribución a través de Internet basado en redes superpuestas donde un grupo de sistemas finales (o pares) participantes forman una estructura de superposición y participa activamente en la distribución de contenido sin ningún soporte especial de la red (por ejemplo, [7]). Dado que las estructuras de superposición están en capas sobre el mejor esfuerzo en Internet, cualquier enfoque para construir superposición debe abordar los siguientes desafíos fundamentales: (i) escalabilidad con el número de pares participantes, (ii) robustez a la dinámica de la participación de los compañeros, (iii) adaptación aVariaciones de ancho de banda de red, y (iv) acomodar la heterogeneidad y la asimetría de la conectividad del ancho de banda entre los pares participantes [19]. Hacer frente a las variaciones de ancho de banda, la heterogeneidad y la asimetría son particularmente importantes en el diseño de la superposición de pares para aplicaciones de transmisión porque la calidad entregada a cada par está determinada directamente por su conectividad de ancho de banda con (otros pares (s) en) la superposición. Este artículo presenta un marco simple para arquitectura de una superposición de receptor de igual a igual, llamada Pro. Pro puede acomodar un espectro de aplicaciones de transmisión no interactivas que van desde la reproducción hasta las sesiones en vivo de modo de conferencia. La filosofía de diseño principal en Pro es que cada par debe poder determinar de forma independiente y egoísta la mejor manera de conectarse a la superposición para maximizar su propia calidad entregada. Hacia este fin, cada par puede conectarse a la topología de superposición en múltiples puntos (es decir, recibir contenido a través de múltiples pares de padres). Por lo tanto, los compañeros participantes forman una superposición no estructurada que puede hacer frente a la alta tasa de rotación [5]. Además, tener múltiples pares de los padres acomoda la heterogeneidad del ancho de banda y la asimetría, mientras que mejora la resiliencia contra la dinámica de la participación entre pares. Pro consiste en dos componentes clave: (i) Descubrimiento de pares basado en chismes: cada par intercambia un mensaje periódicamente (es decir, chismes) con otros compañeros conocidos para aprender progresivamente sobre un subconjunto de compañeros participantes en la superposición que probablemente sean buenos padres. Gossiping proporciona un enfoque escalable y eficiente para el descubrimiento de pares en redes de pares no estructuradas que se pueden personalizar para guiar la dirección del descubrimiento hacia los pares con las propiedades deseadas (por ejemplo, pares con una distancia más corta o mayor ancho de banda).(ii) Selección de los padres impulsado por el receptor: dada la información recopilada sobre otros pares participantes mediante el mecanismo de chismes, cada par (o receptor) mejora gradualmente su propia calidad entregada seleccionando dinámicamente un subconjunto adecuado de pares matrices que maximizan colectivamente el ancho de banda proporcionado al receptor del receptor. Dado que el ancho de banda disponible de diferentes pares participantes a un receptor (y una posible correlación entre ellos) puede medirse solo en ese receptor, un enfoque impulsado por el receptor es la solución natural para maximizar el ancho de banda disponible para los compañeros heterogéneos. Además, el ancho de banda disponible de los pares de los padres sirve como una señal implícita para que un receptor detecte y reaccione a los cambios en la red o la condición de superposición sin ninguna coordinación explícita con otros pares participantes. La selección independiente de los padres por pares individuales conduce a una superposición eficiente que maximiza la calidad entregada a cada par. Pro incorpora 42 varias funciones de amortiguación para garantizar la estabilidad de la superposición a pesar de las acciones descoordinadas de diferentes pares. Pro es parte de una arquitectura más grande que hemos desarrollado para la transmisión por igual. En nuestro trabajo anterior, desarrollamos un mecanismo llamado Pals [18] que permite que un receptor fluya contenido estructurado en capas de un conjunto dado de remitentes controlados por congestión. Por lo tanto, Pro y Pals están impulsados por el receptor pero se complementan entre sí. Más específicamente, Pro determina un subconjunto adecuado de pares de los padres que maximizan colectivamente el ancho de banda entregado a cada receptor, mientras que Pals coordina la transmisión en el tiempo de diferentes segmentos de contenido multimedia de estos padres a pesar de las variaciones impredecibles en su ancho de banda disponible. Esta división de la funcionalidad proporciona una gran flexibilidad porque desacopla la construcción de superposición a partir del mecanismo de entrega. En este artículo, nos centramos principalmente en el mecanismo de construcción de superposición, o Pro. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la Sección 2, revisamos el problema de la construcción de superposición para la transmisión de peer-peer e identificamos sus dos componentes clave e exploramos su espacio de diseño. Ilustramos las diferencias entre las soluciones PRO y las anteriores, y justificamos nuestras opciones de diseño. Presentamos nuestro marco propuesto en la Sección 3. En las secciones 4 y 5, los componentes clave de nuestro marco se describen con más detalle. Finalmente, la Sección 6 concluye el documento y presenta nuestros planes futuros.2. La revisión del problema de construir una superposición entre pares para aplicaciones de transmisión no solo debe acomodar objetivos de diseño globales, como la escalabilidad y la resiliencia, sino que también satisface el objetivo de diseño local de maximizar la calidad entregada a los compañeros individuales 1. Más específicamente, la calidad entregada del contenido de transmisión a cada par debe ser proporcional a su ancho de banda de enlace de acceso entrante. Lograr estos objetivos es particularmente desafiante porque los compañeros participantes a menudo exhiben heterogeneidad y asimetría en su conectividad de ancho de banda. Las soluciones para construir superposiciones entre pares a menudo requieren dos mecanismos clave para implementar en cada par: descubrimiento por pares (PD) y la selección de padres (PS). El mecanismo PD permite a cada par de aprender sobre otros compañeros participantes en la superposición. El mecanismo PS utiliza la información sobre otros pares en cada par para determinar los pares parentales adecuados a través de los cuales debe conectarse a la superposición. El comportamiento colectivo de los mecanismos PD y PS en todos los compañeros participantes conduce a una estructura de superposición que logra los objetivos de diseño anteriores. Ha habido una gran cantidad de investigaciones previas que exploraron el espacio de diseño de los mecanismos PD y PS de la siguiente manera: Descubrimiento de pares: en redes estructuradas entre pares, la estructura existente permite a cada compañero encontrar otros pares participantes de manera escalable (p. Ej., [4]). Sin embargo, las redes estructuradas de igual a igual pueden no ser robustas con una alta tasa de rotación [5]. En contraste, las redes de igual a igual no estructuradas pueden acomodar con gracia una alta tasa de rotación [5] pero requieren un mecanismo de descubrimiento por pares separado. Enfoques de malla (por ejemplo, [7, 6]) que requieren que cada compañero conozca sobre todos los demás pares participantes, así como los enfoques centralizados (por ejemplo, [16]) para el descubrimiento de pares exhiben una escalabilidad limitada. Nice [2] aprovecha una estructura jerárquica para lograr 1 Vale la pena aclarar que nuestro objetivo de diseño es diferente de los objetivos comunes en la construcción de árboles de multidifusión de nivel de aplicación [7] (es decir, minimizando el estiramiento y el estrés).escalabilidad Pero cada par solo conoce un grupo de pares de Closy que pueden no ser buenos padres (es decir, pueden no proporcionar suficiente ancho de banda). Selección de los padres: examinamos dos aspectos clave de las selecciones de padres: (i) Criterios de selección: Hay dos criterios principales para las selecciones de los padres: retraso relativo y ancho de banda disponible entre dos pares. El retraso relativo entre dos pares se puede estimar de manera escalable con una de las soluciones existentes basadas en el punto de referencia, como el posicionamiento de la red global (PNB) [15]. Sin embargo, la estimación de ancho de banda disponible entre dos pares requiere una medición de extremo a extremo. El uso de ancho de banda disponible como criterios para la selección de padres no escala por dos razones: primero, para hacer frente a la dinámica de las variaciones de ancho de banda, cada par requiere estimar periódicamente el ancho de banda disponible de todos los demás pares a través de la medición (por ejemplo, [6]). En segundo lugar, la probabilidad de interferencia entre diferentes mediciones crece con el número de pares en una superposición (similar al experimento articular en RLM [13]). La mayoría de las soluciones anteriores adoptaron la idea de multidifusión de nivel de aplicación y utilizaron el retraso como los principales criterios de selección. Los pares participantes ejecutan cooperativamente un algoritmo distribuido para organizarse en una estructura de árbol arraigada por la fuente para minimizar el retraso general en todas las ramas del árbol (por ejemplo, [7]), o retraso entre la fuente y cada par del receptor (por ejemplo, [, [, [20]). Si bien estas estrategias de selección de padres minimizan la carga de red asociada, es posible que no proporcionen suficiente ancho de banda a los compañeros individuales porque el retraso a menudo no es un buen indicador para el ancho de banda disponible entre dos pares [12, 14]. La cuestión clave es que minimizar el retraso general (objetivo de diseño global) y maximizar el ancho de banda entregado a cada par (objetivo de diseño local) podría estar fácilmente en conflicto. Más específicamente, los pares de los padres con una distancia relativa más larga pueden proporcionar un mayor ancho de banda que los padres cercanos. Esto sugiere que podría existir una compensación entre maximizar el ancho de banda proporcionado a cada par y minimizar el retraso general en la superposición.(ii) Padres individuales vs múltiples: una sola estructura de árbol para la superposición (donde cada par tiene un solo padre) es inherentemente incapaz de acomodar a sus compañeros con ancho de banda heterogéneo y asimétrico. Un enfoque común para acomodar la heterogeneidad del ancho de banda es usar contenido estructurado de capa (codificaciones de descripción en capas o múltiples) y permitir que cada receptor tenga múltiples padres. Este enfoque podría acomodar la heterogeneidad, pero presenta varios desafíos nuevos. Primero, la estrategia de selección de padres debe determinarse en función de la ubicación de un cuello de botella. Si el cuello de botella está en los enlaces de acceso (salientes) de los compañeros de los padres 2, entonces un receptor simplemente debe buscar más padres. Sin embargo, cuando el cuello de botella está en otro lugar en la red, un receptor debe seleccionar a los padres con un conjunto diverso de rutas (es decir, utilizar diferentes rutas de red). En la práctica, una combinación de estos casos podría existir simultáneamente entre los compañeros participantes [1]. En segundo lugar, la transmisión de un solo contenido de múltiples remitentes es un desafío por dos razones: 1) Esto requiere una estricta coordinación entre los remitentes para determinar la calidad general entregada (por ejemplo, número de capas) y decidir qué remitente es responsable de la entrega de cada segmento.2) Los segmentos entregados de diferentes remitentes deben llegar antes de sus tiempos de playout a pesar de la vari2 no correlacionada si el cuello de botella está en el enlace de acceso a los receptores, luego siempre que el ancho de banda al receptor ya esté maximizado.43 ATIONES IN (Congestion controlado) ancho de banda de diferentes remitentes. Esto también implica que aquellas soluciones que construyen una estructura de superposición múltiple de pie pero no garantizan explícitamente la entrega en el tiempo de los segmentos individuales (por ejemplo, [3, 11]) pueden no ser capaces de admitir aplicaciones de transmisión. Un enfoque para construir una superposición de varios padres es organizar a los compañeros participantes en diferentes árboles donde cada capa de la corriente se envía a un árbol separado (por ejemplo, [4, 16]). Cada par puede maximizar su calidad al participar en un número adecuado de árboles. Este enfoque plantea varios problemas: 1) El ancho de banda proporcionado a los compañeros en cada árbol está limitado por el ancho de banda de enlace ascendente mínimo entre los compañeros aguas arriba en ese árbol. En presencia de asimetría de ancho de banda, esto podría limitar fácilmente el ancho de banda administrado en cada árbol debajo del ancho de banda requerido para una sola capa, 2) No es factible construir árboles separados que sean óptimos para un solo criterio de selección (por ejemplo, retraso general),.3) Es probable que las conexiones en diferentes árboles compitan por el ancho de banda disponible en un solo cuello de botella3. Llegamos a la conclusión de que una solución práctica para aplicaciones de transmisión de tope de pares debe incorporar las siguientes propiedades de diseño: (i) debe usar una superposición de igual a igual de pares no estructurada, (ii) debe proporcionar un mecanismo de descubrimiento de pares escalable que permita cada unoPeer para encontrar a sus buenos padres de manera eficiente, (iii) debe detectar (y posiblemente evitar) cualquier cuello de botella compartido entre diferentes conexiones en la superposición, y (iv) debe desplegar conexiones controladas de congestión, pero garantizar la llegada a tiempo de llegada a cada uno.receptor. En la siguiente sección, explicamos cómo Pro incorpora todas las propiedades de diseño anteriores.3. Suposiciones de superposición impulsada por el receptor P2P: suponemos que cada par puede estimar la distancia relativa entre dos pares utilizando el mecanismo del PNB [15]. Además, cada par conoce el ancho de banda entrante y saliente de su enlace de acceso. Cada par utiliza el mecanismo PALS para transmitir el contenido de múltiples pares principales. Todas las conexiones están controladas por los remitentes (por ejemplo, [17]). Para acomodar la heterogeneidad del ancho de banda de pares, suponemos que el contenido tiene una representación en capas. En otras palabras, con un ajuste adecuado, el marco debería funcionar con codificaciones de capas y multiplegry. Los compañeros participantes tienen conectividad de ancho de banda heterogénea y asimétrica. Además, los compañeros pueden unirse y irse de manera arbitraria. Descripción general: en Pro, cada par (o receptor) busca progresivamente un subconjunto de padres que maximizan colectivamente el ancho de banda entregado y minimizan el retraso general de todos los padres al receptor. Tal subconjunto de padres puede cambiar con el tiempo a medida que algunos padres se unen (o dejan) la superposición, o el ancho de banda disponible de los padres actuales cambia significativamente. Tenga en cuenta que cada par puede ser receptor y padre al mismo tiempo 4. Cada receptor intercambia mensajes periódicos (es decir, chismes) con otros compañeros en la superposición para aprender sobre aquellos compañeros participantes que son potencialmente buenos padres. Los padres potencialmente buenos para un receptor se identifican en función de su utilidad relativa para el receptor. La utilidad de un par principal para un receptor PJ es una función de su distancia de red relativa (Delij) y el ancho de banda de enlace de acceso saliente de los padres (FUBWI), (es decir, U (PI, PJ) 3 estos se acercana menudo no usan control de congestión para cada conexión. 4 A lo largo de este documento, usamos receptor y padre como forma corta para el receptor y par principal. = F (deliJ, FUBWI)). El uso del ancho de banda del enlace de acceso de los padres en lugar del ancho de banda disponible tiene varias ventajas: (i) El ancho de banda saliente es un límite superior para el ancho de banda disponible de un padre. Por lo tanto, permite que el receptor clasifique aproximadamente a diferentes padres.(ii) La estimación del ancho de banda disponible requiere una medición de extremo a extremo y dicha solución no escala con el número de pares, y lo que es más importante, (iii) dada una función de utilidad, este enfoque permite que cualquier par en la superposición estime la utilidad relativade cualquier otro compañero. Cada receptor solo mantiene información sobre un número fijo (y relativamente pequeño) de pares principales prometedores en su imagen local. La imagen local en cada receptor se actualiza dinámicamente con nuevos mensajes de chismes a medida que otros pares se unen/dejan la superposición. Cada par selecciona un nuevo padre de manera impulsada por la demanda para minimizar el número de mediciones de ancho de banda de extremo a extremo y, por lo tanto, mejorar la escalabilidad. Cuando un receptor necesita un nuevo padre, su mecanismo PS selecciona aleatoriamente un par de su imagen local donde la probabilidad de seleccionar un par depende directamente de su utilidad. Luego, las propiedades reales (es decir, el ancho de banda disponible y el retraso) del padre seleccionado se verifican mediante medición pasiva. Con este fin, el padre seleccionado se agrega a la lista de los padres que desencadena a PALS para solicitar contenido de este padre. La Figura 1 muestra las interacciones entre los mecanismos PD y PS. En Pro, cada receptor aprovecha el ancho de banda controlado por la congestión de sus padres como una señal implícita para detectar dos eventos: (i) cualquier cuello de botella compartido entre las conexiones de diferentes padres, y (ii) cualquier cambio en las condiciones de red o superposición (por ejemplo, salida o salida o salida o salidaLlegada de otros pares cercanos). La Figura 2 muestra parte de una superposición para ilustrar esta característica. Cada receptor monitorea continuamente el ancho de banda disponible de todos sus padres. El receptor P0 inicialmente solo tiene P1 como padre. Cuando P0 agrega un nuevo padre (P2), el receptor examina el ancho de banda disponible de P1 y P2 y cualquier correlación medible entre ellos. Si el ancho de banda disponible de P1 disminuye después de que se agrega P2, el receptor puede concluir que estos dos padres están detrás del mismo cuello de botella (es decir, Link L0). Observamos que los caminos de dos padres pueden tener una superposición que no incluye ningún cuello de botella. Suponga que otro receptor P3 selecciona P1 como padre y, por lo tanto, compite con el receptor P0 para el ancho de banda disponible en el enlace L1. Supongamos que L1 se convierte en un cuello de botella y la conexión entre P1 a P3 obtiene una participación significativamente mayor del ancho de banda de L1s que la conexión entre P1 a P0. Este cambio en el ancho de banda disponible de P1 sirve como señal para P0. Cada vez que un receptor detecta tal caída en el ancho de banda, espera un período de tiempo aleatorio (proporcional al ancho de banda disponible) y luego cae el disco de pares de origen.

Por lo tanto, el receptor con una conectividad de mayor ancho de banda (P3) es más probable que mantenga P1 como padre, mientras que P0 puede examinar a otros padres con mayor ancho de banda, incluido P3. El ancho de banda controlado por congestión señala el receptor para remodelar adecuadamente la superposición. Presentamos un resumen de las características clave y las limitaciones de Pro en las siguientes dos secciones. La Tabla 1 resume nuestra notación a lo largo de este documento. Características principales: Gossiping proporciona un enfoque escalable para el descubrimiento de pares porque cada par no requiere conocimiento global sobre todos los miembros del grupo, y su tráfico generado se puede controlar. El mecanismo de PD participa activamente en la selección de pares mediante la identificación de pares para la imagen local que limita las posibles elecciones de los padres para el mecanismo PS. Pro construye una superposición múltiple y no estructurada. Pero Pro no tiene las mismas limitaciones que existen en los enfoques de múltiples árboles porque permite que cada receptor microgestione de forma independiente a sus padres para maximizar su ancho de banda general en función de la información local. Pro lleva a cabo la medición pasiva no solo para determinar el ancho de banda disponible de un padre, sino también para detectar cualquier cuello de botella compartido entre caminos de diferentes padres. Además, al seleccionar un nuevo padre de la imagen local, Pro aumenta la probabilidad de encontrar un buen padre en cada selección y, por lo tanto, disminuye significativamente el número de mediciones requeridas que a su vez mejora la escalabilidad. Pro puede acomodar con gracia la heterogeneidad del ancho de banda y la asimetría entre los compañeros, ya que PALS puede manejar la entrega de contenido de un grupo de padres con diferente ancho de banda. Limitaciones y desafíos: La hipótesis principal en nuestro marco es que es probable que el mejor subconjunto de padres para cada receptor sea parte de su imagen local, es decir, el mecanismo PD puede encontrar los mejores padres. Siempre que esta condición no se cumpla, ni un receptor puede no ser capaz de maximizar su ancho de banda general o la superposición resultante puede no ser eficiente.

En estos casos, el valor de la utilidad puede no guiar de manera efectiva el proceso de búsqueda para identificar buenos padres, lo que aumenta el tiempo de convergencia promedio hasta que cada compañero encuentre un buen subconjunto de padres. Similar a muchos otros mecanismos adaptativos (por ejemplo, [13]), el mecanismo de selección principal debe abordar la compensación fundamental entre la capacidad de respuesta y la estabilidad. Finalmente, el ancho de banda controlado por la congestión de los pares de los padres puede no proporcionar una señal medible para detectar un cuello de botella compartido cuando el nivel de multiplexación es alto en el enlace de cuello de botella. Sin embargo, esta no es una limitación importante ya que el impacto negativo de un cuello de botella compartido en estos casos es mínimo. Todas las limitaciones anteriores se deben en parte a la simplicidad de nuestro marco y afectarían negativamente su rendimiento. Sin embargo, creemos que esta es una compensación de diseño razonable ya que la simplicidad es uno de nuestros objetivos de diseño clave. En las siguientes secciones, describimos los dos componentes clave de nuestro marco en más detalles.4. Descubrimiento de pares basado en chismes El descubrimiento de pares en cada receptor es básicamente una búsqueda entre todos los compañeros participantes en la superposición para un cierto número (IMG SZ) de pares con la utilidad relativa más alta. Pro adopta un enfoque de chismes [10] para el descubrimiento de pares. El chismoso (o la propagación de rumores) se ha utilizado con frecuencia como una alternativa escalable a las inundaciones que difunde gradualmente la información entre un grupo de pares. Sin embargo, utilizamos el chismoso como mecanismo de búsqueda [9] para encontrar padres prometedores, ya que tiene dos propiedades atractivas (i) El volumen de mensajes intercambiados se puede controlar, y (ii) el intercambio de información basado en el chisme se puede personalizar para aprovechar los valores de utilidad relativos para mejorar la eficiencia de búsqueda. El mecanismo de chismes funciona de la siguiente manera: cada par mantiene una imagen local que contiene hasta los registros IMG SZ donde cada registro representa la siguiente información para un PI de par en la superposición: 1) Dirección IP, 2) Coordenadas de GNP, 3) Númerode capas recibidas, 4) marca de tiempo cuando el registro fue generado por última vez por un par, 5) FuBWI y 6) INBWI. Para arrancar el proceso de descubrimiento, un nuevo receptor necesita aprender sobre un puñado de otros compañeros participantes en la superposición. Esta información se puede obtener del servidor original (o un punto de encuentro bien conocido). El servidor debe implementar una estrategia para seleccionar los pares iniciales que se proporcionan a cada receptor nuevo. Llamamos a esto el mecanismo inicial de selección de los padres. Una vez que se conoce el conjunto inicial de pares, cada Pi Pi invoca periódicamente un mecanismo de selección de objetivos para determinar un par objetivo (PJ) de su imagen local para chismes. Dada una función de utilidad, Peer PI utiliza una estrategia de selección de contenido para seleccionar registros SGM (o un número más pequeño cuando los registros SGM no están disponibles) desde su imagen local que son más útiles para PJ y enviar esos registros a PJ. En respuesta, PJ sigue los mismos pasos y responde con un mensaje de chismes que incluye registros SGM de su imagen local que son más útiles para PI, es decir, chismes bidireccionales. Cuando un mensaje de chismes llega a cada par, un esquema de mantenimiento de imágenes integra nuevos registros en la imagen local actual y descarta los registros excesivos de tal manera que se mejore cierta propiedad de la imagen local (por ejemplo, aumentar la utilidad general de los pares en la imagen) rendimiento agregado de45 Un mecanismo de chismes puede presentarse mediante dos métricas promedio y su distribución entre pares: (i) Tiempo de convergencia promedio: número promedio de mensajes de chismes hasta que todos los compañeros en una superposición alcanzan sus imágenes finales, y (ii) relación de eficiencia promedio: relación promediode registros únicos al número total de registros recibidos por cada par. Hemos estado explorando el espacio de diseño de cuatro componentes clave del mecanismo de chismes. La frecuencia y el tamaño de los mensajes de chismes determinan la frescura promedio de las imágenes locales. Actualmente, el servidor selecciona aleatoriamente a los padres iniciales de su imagen local para cada nuevo par. Selección del objetivo: la selección de objetivos elige aleatoriamente un par de la imagen actual para obtener información de diferentes áreas de la superposición y acelerar el descubrimiento. Selección de contenido: PK PK determina la utilidad relativa de todos los pares (PJ) en su imagen local para Target Peer PI, y luego selecciona aleatoriamente a los compañeros SGM para preparar un mensaje de chismes para PI. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de seleccionar un par depende directamente de su utilidad. Este enfoque está sesgado hacia pares con una mayor utilidad, pero su aleatoriedad tiende a reducir el número de registros duplicados en diferentes mensajes de chismes de un par (es decir, mejora la eficiencia). Un posible inconveniente de este enfoque es el aumento en el tiempo de convergencia. Planeamos examinar esquemas de intercambio de información más eficientes, como los filtros de Bloom [3] en nuestro trabajo futuro. Pro utiliza el rango articular [15] para determinar la utilidad relativa de un padre para un receptor. Dada una colección de pares en una imagen local de PK, el esquema detranking de unión clasifica a todos los compañeros una vez en función de su ancho de banda saliente, y luego en función de su retraso estimado de un Pi de Pi Target. La utilidad de Peer PJ (U (PJ, PI)) es inversamente proporcional a la suma de los rangos de PJS en ambas clasificaciones. Los valores para cada propiedad (es decir, ancho de banda y retraso) de varios pares se dividen en múltiples rangos (es decir, contenedores) donde se supone que todos los pares dentro de cada rango tienen el mismo valor para esa propiedad. Este esquema de binning minimiza la sensibilidad a diferencias menores en el retraso o el ancho de banda entre diferentes pares. Mantenimiento de la imagen: el mecanismo de mantenimiento de la imagen desaloja registros adicionales (más allá de IMG SZ) que satisfacen una de las siguientes condiciones: (i) Representar a pares con la utilidad inferior, (ii) representan pares que ya fueron eliminados por el mecanismo de PS debido al bajo rendimiento y(iii) tienen una marca de tiempo mayor que un umbral. Este enfoque intenta equilibrar la calidad de la imagen (en términos de utilidad general de los pares existentes) y su frescura. Tenga en cuenta que el mecanismo de chismes puede descubrir cualquier par en la superposición siempre que la accesibilidad se proporcione a través de la superposición entre las imágenes locales en diferentes pares. Cuanto mayor sea la cantidad de superposición, mayor es la eficiencia del descubrimiento y mayor es la robustez de la superposición a la dinámica de las participaciones de los pares. La cantidad de superposición entre las imágenes depende tanto del tamaño como de la forma de las imágenes locales en cada par. La forma de la imagen local es una función de la función de utilidad implementada. La utilidad de rango de articulación da el mismo peso para retrasar y el ancho de banda. El retraso tiende a sesgar la selección de pares cercanos, mientras que el ancho de banda saliente introduce cierto grado de aleatoriedad en la ubicación de pares seleccionados. Por lo tanto, las imágenes locales resultantes deben exhibir un grado suficiente de superposición.5. Selección de los padres El mecanismo PS en cada par es esencialmente una búsqueda progresiva dentro de la imagen local para un subconjunto de pares de los padres, de modo que se alcancen los siguientes objetivos de diseño: (i) Maximizar el ancho de banda entregado 5, (ii) Minimizar el retraso total de todos los padresal receptor, y (iii) maximizar la diversidad de caminos de los padres (siempre que sea factible). Siempre que estos objetivos estén en conflicto, un receptor optimiza el objetivo con la más alta prioridad. Actualmente, nuestro marco no considera directamente la diversidad de caminos de diferentes padres como criterios para la selección de padres. Sin embargo, el efecto indirecto de la ruta compartida entre los padres se aborda debido a su impacto potencial en el ancho de banda disponible de un padre cuando dos o más padres están detrás del mismo cuello de botella. El número de padres activos (NOPI (t)) para cada receptor debe estar dentro de un rango configurado [min nop, max nop]. Cada receptor intenta maximizar su ancho de banda entregado con el número mínimo de padres. Si este objetivo no se puede lograr después de la evaluación de un cierto número de nuevos padres, el receptor aumentará gradualmente su número de padres. Esta flexibilidad es importante para utilizar el ancho de banda disponible de los padres de bajo ancho de banda, es decir, hacer frente a la heterogeneidad del ancho de banda.MIN NOP determina un grado mínimo de resiliencia a la salida de los padres y un nivel mínimo de diversidad de rutas (siempre que estén disponibles diversas rutas). El número de niños para cada compañero no debe limitarse. En cambio, cada par solo limita el ancho de banda saliente máximo que es capaz (o dispuesto) a proporcionar a sus hijos. Esto permite a los compañeros de los hijos competir por el ancho de banda controlado por congestión de un padre que motiva a los compañeros de los niños con una conectividad de pobre ancho de banda para buscar a otros padres (es decir, remodelar adecuadamente la superposición). El diseño de un mecanismo de PS debe abordar tres preguntas principales de la siguiente manera: 1) ¿Cuándo se debe seleccionar un nuevo padre? Existe una compensación fundamental entre la capacidad de respuesta de un receptor a los cambios en las condiciones de la red (o tiempo de convergencia después de un cambio) y la estabilidad de la superposición. Pro adopta un enfoque conservador donde cada par selecciona a un nuevo padre de manera impulsada por la demanda. Esto debería reducir significativamente el número de nuevas selecciones de padres, lo que a su vez mejora la escalabilidad (al minimizar la interferencia causada por nuevas conexiones) y la estabilidad de la estructura de superposición. Se selecciona un nuevo padre en los siguientes escenarios: (i) Fase inicial: cuando un nuevo compañero se une a la superposición, agrega periódicamente un nuevo padre hasta que tiene padres no.(ii) Reemplazar a un padre de bajo rendimiento: cuando cuando el ancho de banda disponible de un padre existente se reduce significativamente durante mucho tiempo o un padre sale de la sesión, el receptor puede seleccionar otro par después de un retraso aleatorio. Cada receptor selecciona un retraso aleatorio proporcional a su ancho de banda disponible del par principal [8]. Este enfoque amortigua la oscilación potencial en la superposición al tiempo que aumenta las posibilidades de receptores con una conectividad de mayor ancho de banda para mantener a un padre (es decir, reorganiza adecuadamente la superposición).(iii) Mejora en el rendimiento: cuando es probable que un nuevo padre mejore significativamente un aspecto no optimizado del rendimiento (aumente el ancho de banda o disminuya el retraso). Esta estrategia permite la mejora gradual del subconjunto de los padres a medida que se descubren (o se unen) los nuevos pares la superposición. La información disponible para cada par en la imagen se usa como heurística para predecir el rendimiento de un nuevo par. Tal mejora debe examinarse con poca frecuencia. Un mecanismo de histéresis 5 El ancho de banda objetivo es el valor más bajo entre el ancho de banda de transmisión máximo y el ancho de banda entrante de los receptores.46 se implementa en el escenario (II) y (iii) para amortiguar cualquier oscilación potencial en la superposición.2) ¿Qué par debe seleccionarse como un nuevo padre? En cualquier momento, los compañeros en la imagen local son los compañeros candidatos más conocidos para servir como padre. En Pro, cada receptor selecciona aleatoriamente a un padre de su imagen actual donde la probabilidad de seleccionar un padre es proporcional a su utilidad. El despliegue de esta estrategia de selección de todos los pares conduce a la utilización proporcional del ancho de banda saliente de todos los pares sin hacer que la selección sea muy sesgada hacia los compañeros de alto ancho de banda. Este enfoque (similar a [5]) aprovecha la heterogeneidad entre los pares, ya que el número de niños para cada compañero es proporcional a su ancho de banda saliente.3) ¿Cómo se debe examinar a un nuevo padre? Cada receptor monitorea continuamente el ancho de banda disponible de todos los padres y la correlación potencial entre el ancho de banda de dos o más conexiones como señal para el cuello de botella compartido. El grado de dicha correlación también revela el nivel de multiplexación en el enlace del cuello de botella, y podría servir como un indicador para separar los cuellos de botella remotos de uno local. Dicho monitoreo debe usar el ancho de banda promedio de cada flujo en una escala de tiempo relativamente larga (por ejemplo, cientos de RTT) para filtrar cualquier variación transitoria en el ancho de banda. Para evitar seleccionar a un padre de bajo rendimiento en el futuro cercano, el receptor asocia un temporizador a cada padre y retrocede exponencialmente el temporizador después de cada experiencia fallida [13]. Después de la fase inicial, cada receptor mantiene un número fijo de padres en cualquier momento (NOPI (t)). Por lo tanto, un nuevo padre debe reemplazar a uno de los padres activos. Sin embargo, para garantizar la mejora monotónica en el rendimiento general de los padres activos, siempre se agrega un nuevo padre antes de que uno de los padres existentes se elimine (es decir, un receptor puede tener temporalmente un padre adicional). Dado el ancho de banda disponible de todos los padres (incluido el nuevo) y la posible correlación entre ellos, un receptor puede usar uno de los siguientes criterios para soltar a un padre: (i) Para maximizar el ancho de banda, el receptor puede soltar el padre que contribuye al mínimoAncho de banda, (ii) para maximizar la diversidad de ruta entre las conexiones de los padres, el receptor debe dejar caer el padre que se encuentra detrás del mismo cuello de botella con el mayor número de padres activos y contribuye con un ancho de banda mínimo entre ellos. Finalmente, si el ancho de banda agregado de todos los padres permanece por debajo del ancho de banda requerido después de examinar cierto número de nuevos padres (y nopi (t) <max nop), el receptor puede aumentar el número total de padres por uno.6. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro En este documento, presentamos un marco simple impulsado por el receptor para arquitectar estructuras de superposición entre pares llamadas Pro. Pro permite a cada par para determinar egoísta e independientemente la mejor manera de conectarse a la superposición para maximizar su rendimiento. Por lo tanto, Pro debe poder maximizar la calidad entregada a los pares con conectividad de ancho de banda heterogénea y asimétrica. Tanto el descubrimiento de pares como la selección de pares en este marco son escalables. Además, Pro utiliza el ancho de banda controlado por congestión como una señal implícita para detectar cuello de botella compartido entre los padres existentes, así como los cambios en las condiciones de red o superposición para remodelar adecuadamente la estructura. Describimos el marco básico y sus componentes clave, y dibujamos nuestras soluciones de Strawman. Este es un punto de partida para nuestro trabajo en Pro. Actualmente estamos evaluando varios aspectos de este marco a través de la simulación y explorando el espacio de diseño de los componentes clave. También estamos creando prototipos de este marco para realizar experimentos del mundo real en el planeta-lab en un futuro cercano.7. Referencias [1] A. Akella, S. Seshan y A. Shaikh.

        "A Framework for Architecting Peer-to-Peer Receiver-driven Overlays Reza Rejaie Department of Computer Science University of Oregon reza@cs.uoregon.edu Shad Stafford Department of Computer Science University of Oregon staffors@cs.uoregon.edu ABSTRACT This paper presents a simple and scalable framework for architecting peer-to-peer overlays called Peer-to-peer Receiverdriven Overlay (or PRO).",
        "PRO is designed for non-interactive streaming applications and its primary design goal is to maximize delivered bandwidth (and thus delivered quality) to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
        "To achieve this goal, PRO adopts a receiver-driven approach where each receiver (or participating peer) (i) independently discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and (ii) selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own delivered bandwidth.",
        "Participating peers form an unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to high churn rate.",
        "Furthermore, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as implicit signal to detect and react to long-term changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers.",
        "Independent parent selection by individual peers dynamically converge to an efficient overlay structure.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors: C.2.4 [ComputerCommunication Networks]: Distributed Systems General Terms: Design, Measurement 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Limited deployment of IP multicast has motivated a new distribution paradigm over the Internet based on overlay networks where a group of participating end-systems (or peers) form an overlay structure and actively participate in distribution of content without any special support from the network (e.g., [7]).",
        "Since overlay structures are layered over the best-effort Internet, any approach for constructing overlay should address the following fundamental challenges: (i) Scalability with the number of participating peers, (ii) Robustness to dynamics of peer participation, (iii) Adaptation to variations of network bandwidth, and (iv) Accommodating heterogeneity and asymmetry of bandwidth connectivity among participating peers[19].",
        "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",
        "This paper presents a simple framework for architecting Peer-to-peer Receiver-driven Overlay, called PRO.",
        "PRO can accommodate a spectrum of non-interactive streaming applications ranging from playback to lecture-mode live sessions.",
        "The main design philosophy in PRO is that each peer should be allowed to independently and selfishly determine the best way to connect to the overlay in order to maximize its own delivered quality.",
        "Toward this end, each peer can connect to the overlay topology at multiple points (i.e., receive content through multiple parent peers).",
        "Therefore, participating peers form an unstructured overlay that can gracefully cope with high churn rate[5].",
        "Furthermore, having multiple parent peers accommodates bandwidth heterogeneity and asymmetry while improves resiliency against dynamics of peer participation.",
        "PRO consists of two key components: (i) Gossip-based Peer Discovery: Each peer periodically exchanges message (i.e., gossips) with other known peers to progressively learn about a subset of participating peers in the overlay that are likely to be good parents.",
        "Gossiping provides a scalable and efficient approach to peer discovery in unstructured peer-to-peer networks that can be customized to guide direction of discovery towards peers with desired properties (e.g., peers with shorter distance or higher bandwidth). (ii) Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver.",
        "Since the available bandwidth from different participating peers to a receiver (and possible correlation among them) can be measured only at that receiver, a receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers.",
        "Furthermore, the available bandwidth from parent peers serves as an implicit signal for a receiver to detect and react to changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers.",
        "Independent parent selection by individual peers leads to an efficient overlay that maximizes delivered quality to each peer.",
        "PRO incorporates 42 several damping functions to ensure stability of the overlay despite uncoordinated actions by different peers.",
        "PRO is part of a larger architecture that we have developed for peer-to-peer streaming.",
        "In our earlier work, we developed a mechanism called PALS [18] that enables a receiver to stream layered structured content from a given set of congestion controlled senders.",
        "Thus, PRO and PALS are both receiver-driven but complement each other.",
        "More specifically, PRO determines a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize delivered bandwidth to each receiver whereas PALS coordinates in-time streaming of different segments of multimedia content from these parents despite unpredictable variations in their available bandwidth.",
        "This division of functionality provides a great deal of flexibility because it decouples overlay construction from delivery mechanism.",
        "In this paper, we primarily focus on the overlay construction mechanism, or PRO.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we revisit the problem of overlay construction for peerto-peer streaming and identify its two key components and explore their design space.",
        "We illustrate the differences between PRO and previous solutions, and justify our design choices.",
        "We present our proposed framework in Section 3.",
        "In Sections 4 and 5, the key components of our framework are described in further detail.",
        "Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and presents our future plans. 2.",
        "REVISITING THE PROBLEM Constructing a peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications should not only accommodate global design goals such as scalability and resilience but also satisfy the local design goal of maximizing delivered quality to individual peers 1 .",
        "More specifically, delivered quality of streaming content to each peer should be proportional to its incoming access link bandwidth.",
        "Achieving these goals is particularly challenging because participating peers often exhibit heterogeneity and asymmetry in their bandwidth connectivity.",
        "Solutions for constructing peer-to-peer overlays often require two key mechanisms to be implemented at each peer: Peer Discovery (PD) and Parent Selection (PS).",
        "The PD mechanism enables each peer to learn about other participating peers in the overlay.",
        "Information about other peers are used by the PS mechanism at each peer to determine proper parent peers through which it should connect to the overlay.",
        "The collective behavior of PD and PS mechanisms at all participating peers leads to an overlay structure that achieves the above design goals.",
        "There has been a wealth of previous research that explored design space of the PD and PS mechanisms as follows: Peer Discovery: In structured peer-to-peer networks, the existing structure enables each peer to find other participating peers in a scalable fashion (e.g., [4]).",
        "However, structured peer-to-peer networks may not be robust against high churn rate [5].",
        "In contrast, unstructured peer-to-peer networks can gracefully accommodate high churn rate [5] but require a separate peer discovery mechanism.",
        "Meshfirst approaches (e.g., [7, 6]) that require each peer to know about all other participating peers as well as centralized approaches (e.g., [16]) to peer discovery exhibit limited scalability.",
        "NICE [2] leverages a hierarchal structure to achieve 1 It is worth clarifying that our design goal is different from common goals in building application-level multicast trees [7] (i.e., minimizing stretch and stress). scalability but each peer only knows about a group of closeby peers who may not be good parents (i.e., may not provide sufficient bandwidth).",
        "Parent Selection: We examine two key aspects of parent selections: (i) Selection Criteria: There are two main criteria for parent selections: relative delay and available bandwidth between two peers.",
        "Relative delay between any two peers can be estimated in a scalable fashion with one of the existing landmark-based solutions such as Global Network Positioning (GNP) [15].",
        "However, estimating available bandwidth between two peers requires end-to-end measurement.",
        "Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons: First, to cope with dynamics of bandwidth variations, each peer requires to periodically estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through measurement (e.g., [6]).",
        "Second, the probability of interference among different measurements grows with the number of peers in an overlay (similar to joint experiment in RLM [13]).",
        "Most of the previous solutions adopted the idea of application level multicast and used delay as the main selection criteria.",
        "Participating peers cooperatively run a distributed algorithm to organize themselves into a source-rooted tree structure in order to minimize either overall delay across all branches of the tree (e.g., [7]), or delay between source and each receiver peer (e.g., [20]).",
        "While these parent selection strategies minimize associated network load, they may not provide sufficient bandwidth to individual peers because delay is often not a good indicator for available bandwidth between two peers [12, 14].",
        "The key issue is that minimizing overall delay (global design goal) and maximizing delivered bandwidth to each peer (local design goal) could easily be in conflict.",
        "More specifically, parent peers with longer relative distance may provide higher bandwidth than close-by parents.",
        "This suggests that there might exist a tradeoff between maximizing provided bandwidth to each peer and minimizing overall delay across the overlay. (ii) Single vs Multiple Parents: A single tree structure for the overlay (where each peer has a single parent) is inherently unable to accommodate peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
        "A common approach to accommodating bandwidth heterogeneity is to use layer structured content (either layered or multiple description encodings) and allow each receiver to have multiple parents.",
        "This approach could accommodate heterogeneity but it introduces several new challenges.",
        "First, parent selection strategy should be determined based on location of a bottleneck.",
        "If the bottleneck is at the (outgoing) access links of parent peers 2 , then a receiver should simply look for more parents.",
        "However, when the bottleneck is else where in the network, a receiver should select parents with a diverse set of paths (i.e., utilize different network paths).",
        "In practice, a combination of these cases might simultaneously exist among participating peers [1].",
        "Second, streaming a single content from multiple senders is challenging for two reasons: 1) This requires tight coordination among senders to determine overall delivered quality (e.g., number of layers) and decide which sender is responsible for delivery of each segment. 2) Delivered segments from different senders should arrive before their playout times despite uncorrelated vari2 if bottleneck is at the receivers access link, then provided bandwidth to the receiver is already maximized. 43 ations in (congestion controlled) bandwidth from different senders.",
        "This also implies that those solutions that build multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure in-time delivery of individual segments (e.g., [3, 11]) may not be able to support streaming applications.",
        "One approach to build a multi-parent overlay is to organize participating peers into different trees where each layer of the stream is sent to a separate tree (e.g., [4, 16]).",
        "Each peer can maximize its quality by participating in a proper number of trees.",
        "This approach raises several issues: 1) the provided bandwidth to peers in each tree is limited by minimum uplink bandwidth among upstream peers on that tree.",
        "In the presence of bandwidth asymmetry, this could easily limit delivered bandwidth on each tree below the required bandwidth for a single layer, 2) it is not feasible to build separate trees that are all optimal for a single selection criteria (e.g., overall delay),. 3) connections across different trees are likely to compete for available bandwidth on a single bottleneck3 .",
        "We conclude that a practical solution for peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following design properties: (i) it should use an unstructured, multiparent peer-to-peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver.",
        "In the next section, we explain how PRO incorporates all the above design properties. 3.",
        "P2P RECEIVER-DRIVEN OVERLAY Assumptions: We assume that each peer can estimate the relative distance between any two peers using the GNP mechanism [15].",
        "Furthermore, each peer knows the incoming and outgoing bandwidth of its access link.",
        "Each peer uses the PALS mechanism to stream content from multiple parent peers.",
        "All connections are congestion controlled by senders (e.g., [17]).",
        "To accommodate peer bandwidth heterogeneity, we assume that the content has a layered representation.",
        "In other words, with proper adjustment, the framework should work with both layered and multipledescription encodings.",
        "Participating peers have heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth connectivity.",
        "Furthermore, peers may join and leave in an arbitrary fashion.",
        "Overview: In PRO, each peer (or receiver) progressively searches for a subset of parents that collectively maximize delivered bandwidth and minimize overall delay from all parents to the receiver.",
        "Such a subset of parents may change over time as some parents join (or leave) the overlay, or available bandwidth from current parents significantly changes.",
        "Note that each peer can be both receiver and parent at the same time 4 .",
        "Each receiver periodically exchanges messages (i.e., gossips) with other peers in the overlay to learn about those participating peers that are potentially good parents.",
        "Potentially good parents for a receiver are identified based on their relative utility for the receiver.",
        "The utility of a parent peer pi for a receiver pj is a function of their relative network distance (delij) and the outgoing access link bandwidth of the parent (outbwi), (i.e., U(pi, pj) 3 These multi-tree approaches often do not use congestion control for each connection. 4 Throughout this paper we use receiver and parent as short form for receiver peer and parent peer. = f(delij, outbwi)).",
        "Using parents access link bandwidth instead of available bandwidth has several advantages: (i) outgoing bandwidth is an upper bound for available bandwidth from a parent.",
        "Therefore, it enables the receiver to roughly classify different parents. (ii) estimating available bandwidth requires end-to-end measurement and such a solution does not scale with the number of peers, and more importantly, (iii) given a utility function, this approach enables any peer in the overlay to estimate relative utility of any other two peers.",
        "Each receiver only maintains information about a fixed (and relatively small) number of promising parent peers in its local image.",
        "The local image at each receiver is dynamically updated with new gossip messages as other peers join/leave the overlay.",
        "Each peer selects a new parent in a demand-driven fashion in order to minimize the number of end-to-end bandwidth measurements, and thus improve scalability.",
        "When a receiver needs a new parent, its PS mechanism randomly selects a peer from its local image where probability of selecting a peer directly depends on its utility.",
        "Then, the actual properties (i.e., available bandwidth and delay) of the selected parent are verified through passive measurement.",
        "Toward this end, the selected parent is added to the parent list which triggers PALS to request content from this parent.",
        "Figure 1 depicts the interactions between PD and PS mechanisms.",
        "In PRO, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as an implicit signal to detect two events: (i) any measurable shared bottleneck among connections from different parents, and (ii) any change in network or overlay conditions (e.g., departure or arrival of other close-by peers).",
        "Figure 2 shows part of an overlay to illustrate this feature.",
        "Each receiver continuously monitors available bandwidth from all its parents.",
        "Receiver p0 initially has only p1 as a parent.",
        "When p0 adds a new parent (p2), the receiver examines the smoothed available bandwidth from p1 and p2 and any measurable correlation between them.",
        "If the available bandwidth from p1 decreases after p2 is added, the receiver can conclude that these two parents are behind the same bottleneck (i.e., link L0).",
        "We note that paths from two parents might have some overlap that does not include any bottleneck.",
        "Assume another receiver p3 selects p1 as a parent and thus competes with receiver p0 for available bandwidth on link L1.",
        "Suppose that L1 becomes a bottleneck and the connection between p1 to p3 obtains a significantly higher share of L1s bandwidth than connection between p1 to p0.",
        "This change in available bandwidth from p1 serves as a signal for p0.",
        "Whenever a receiver detects such a drop in bandwidth, it waits for a random period of time (proportional to the available bandwidth) and then drops Source Peer Disc.",

        "Therefore, the receiver with a higher bandwidth connectivity (p3) is more likely to keep p1 as parent whereas p0 may examine other parents with higher bandwidth including p3.",
        "The congestion controlled bandwidth signals the receiver to properly reshape the overlay.",
        "We present a summary of key features and limitations of PRO in the next two sections.",
        "Table 1 summarizes our notation throughout this paper.",
        "Main Features: Gossiping provides a scalable approach to peer discovery because each peer does not require global knowledge about all group members, and its generated traffic can be controlled.",
        "The PD mechanism actively participates in peer selection by identifying peers for the local image which limits the possible choices of parents for the PS mechanism.",
        "PRO constructs a multi-parent, unstructured overlay.",
        "But PRO does not have the same limitations that exist in multi-tree approaches because it allows each receiver to independently micro-manage its parents to maximize its overall bandwidth based on local information.",
        "PRO conducts passive measurement not only to determine available bandwidth from a parent but also to detect any shared bottleneck between paths from different parents.",
        "Furthermore, by selecting a new parent from the local image, PRO increases the probability of finding a good parent in each selection, and thus significantly decreases number of required measurements which in turn improves scalability.",
        "PRO can gracefully accommodate bandwidth heterogeneity and asymmetry among peers since PALS is able to manage delivery of content from a group of parents with different bandwidth.",
        "Limitations and Challenges: The main hypothesis in our framework is that the best subset of parents for each receiver are likely to be part of its local image i.e., PD mechanism can find the best parents.",
        "Whenever this condition is not satisfied, either a receiver may not be able to maximize its overall bandwidth or resulting overlay may not be efficient.",
        "Table 1: Notation used throughout the paper Symbol Definition. pi Peer i inbwi Incoming access link BW for pi outbwi Outgoing access link BW for pi min nopi Min.",

        "No of parents for pi nopi(t) No of active parents for pi at time t img sz Size of local image at each peer sgm Size of gossip message delij Estimated delay between pi and pj Clearly, properties of the selected utility function as well as accuracy of estimated parameters (in particular using outgoing bandwidth instead of available bandwidth) determine properties of the local image at each peer which in turn affects performance of the framework in some scenarios.",
        "In these cases, the utility value may not effectively guide the search process in identifying good parents which increases the average convergence time until each peer finds a good subset of parents.",
        "Similar to many other adaptive mechanisms (e.g., [13]), the parent selection mechanism should address the fundamental tradeoff between responsiveness and stability.",
        "Finally, the congestion controlled bandwidth from parent peers may not provide a measurable signal to detect a shared bottleneck when level of multiplexing is high at the bottleneck link.",
        "However, this is not a major limitation since the negative impact of a shared bottleneck in these cases is minimal.",
        "All the above limitations are in part due to the simplicity of our framework and would adversely affect its performance.",
        "However, we believe that this is a reasonable design tradeoff since simplicity is one of our key design goals.",
        "In the following sections, we describe the two key components of our framework in further details. 4.",
        "GOSSIP-BASED PEER DISCOVERY Peer discovery at each receiver is basically a search among all participating peers in the overlay for a certain number (img sz) of peers with the highest relative utility.",
        "PRO adopts a gossip-like [10] approach to peer discovery.",
        "Gossiping (or rumor spreading) has been frequently used as a scalable alternative to flooding that gradually spreads information among a group of peers.However, we use gossiping as a search mechanism [9] for finding promising parents since it has two appealing properties (i) the volume of exchanged messages can be controlled, and (ii) the gossip-based information exchange can be customized to leverage relative utility values to improve search efficiency.",
        "The gossip mechanism works as follow: each peer maintains a local image that contains up to img sz records where each record represents the following information for a previously discovered peer pi in the overlay: 1) IP address, 2) GNP coordinates, 3) number of received layers, 4) timestamp when the record was last generated by a peer, 5) outbwi and 6) inbwi.",
        "To bootstrap the discovery process, a new receiver needs to learn about a handful of other participating peers in the overlay.",
        "This information can be obtained from the original server (or a well-known rendezvous point).",
        "The server should implement a strategy for selecting the initial peers that are provided to each new receiver.",
        "We call this the initial parent selection mechanism.",
        "Once the initial set of peers are known, each peer pi periodically invokes a target selection mechanism to determine a target peer (pj) from its local image for gossip.",
        "Given a utility function, peer pi uses a content selection strategy to select sgm records (or smaller number when sgm records are not available) from its local image that are most useful for pj and send those records to pj.",
        "In response, pj follows the same steps and replies with a gossip message that includes sgm records from its local image that are most useful for pi, i.e., bidirectional gossip.",
        "When a gossip message arrives at each peer, an image maintenance scheme integrates new records into the current local image and discards excess records such that certain property of the local image is improved (e.g., increase overall utility of peers in the image) Aggregate performance of 45 a gossip mechanism can be presented by two average metrics and their distribution among peers: (i) Average Convergence Time: average number of gossip messages until all peers in an overlay reach their final images, and (ii) Average Efficiency Ratio: average ratio of unique records to the total number of received records by each peer.",
        "We have been exploring the design space of four key components of the gossip mechanism.",
        "Frequency and size of gossip messages determine average freshness of local images.",
        "Currently, the server randomly selects the initial parents from its local image for each new peer.",
        "Target Selection: Target selection randomly picks a peer from the current image to evenly obtain information from different areas of the overlay and speed up discovery.",
        "Content Selection: peer pk determines relative utility of all the peers (pj) in its local image for target peer pi, and then randomly selects sgm peers to prepare a gossip message for pi.",
        "However, probability of selecting a peer directly depends on its utility.",
        "This approach is biased towards peers with higher utility but its randomness tend to reduce number of duplicate records in different gossip message from one peer (i.e., improves efficiency).",
        "A potential drawback of this approach is the increase in convergence time.",
        "We plan to examine more efficient information sharing schemes such as bloom filters [3] in our future work.",

        "The utility of peer pj (U(pj, pi)) is inversely proportional to the sum of pjs ranks in both rankings.",
        "Values for each property (i.e., bandwidth and delay) of various peers are divided into multiple ranges (i.e., bins) where all peers within each range are assumed to have the same value for that property.",
        "This binning scheme minimizes the sensitivity to minor differences in delay or bandwidth among different peers.",
        "Image maintenance: Image maintenance mechanism evicts extra records (beyond img sz) that satisfy one of the following conditions: (i) represent peers with the lower utility, (ii) represent peers that were already dropped by the PS mechanism due to poor performance and (iii) have a timestamp older than a threshold.",
        "This approach attempts to balance image quality (in terms of overall utility of existing peers) and its freshness.",
        "Note that the gossip mechanism can discover any peer in the overlay as long as reachability is provided through overlap among local images at different peers.",
        "The higher the amount of overlap, the higher the efficiency of discovery, and the higher the robustness of the overlay to dynamics of peer participations.",
        "The amount of overlap among images depends on both the size and shape of the local images at each peer.",
        "The shape of the local image is a function of the deployed utility function.",
        "Joint-ranking utility gives the same weight to delay and bandwidth.",
        "Delay tends to bias selection towards near-by peers whereas outgoing bandwidth introduces some degree of randomness in location of selected peers.",
        "Therefore, the resulting local images should exhibit a sufficient degree of overlap. 5.",
        "PARENT SELECTION The PS mechanism at each peer is essentially a progressive search within the local image for a subset of parent peers such that the following design goals are achieved: (i) maximizing delivered bandwidth 5 , (ii) minimizing the total delay from all parents to the receiver, and (iii) maximizing diversity of paths from parents (whenever it is feasible).",
        "Whenever these goals are in conflict, a receiver optimizes the goal with the highest priority.",
        "Currently, our framework does not directly consider diversity of paths from different parents as a criteria for parent selection.",
        "However, the indirect effect of shared path among parents is addressed because of its potential impact on available bandwidth from a parent when two or more parents are behind the same bottleneck.",
        "The number of active parents (nopi(t)) for each receiver should be within a configured range [min nop, max nop].",
        "Each receiver tries to maximize its delivered bandwidth with the minimum number of parents.",
        "If this goal can not be achieved after evaluation of a certain number of new parents, the receiver will gradually increase its number of parents.",
        "This flexibility is important in order to utilize available bandwidth from low bandwidth parents, i.e., cope with bandwidth heterogeneity. min nop determines minimum degree of resilience to parent departure, and minimum level of path diversity (whenever diverse paths are available).",
        "The number of children for each peer should not be limited.",
        "Instead, each peer only limits maximum outgoing bandwidth that it is able (or willing) to provide to its children.",
        "This allows child peers to compete for congestion controlled bandwidth from a parent which motivates child peers with poor bandwidth connectivity to look for other parents (i.e., properly reshape the overlay).",
        "Design of a PS mechanism should address three main questions as follows: 1) When should a new parent be selected?",
        "There is a fundamental tradeoff between responsiveness of a receiver to changes in network conditions (or convergence time after a change) and stability of the overlay.",
        "PRO adopts a conservative approach where each peer selects a new parent in a demand-driven fashion.",
        "This should significantly reduce number of new parent selections, which in turn improves scalability (by minimizing the interference caused by new connections) and stability of the overlay structure.",
        "A new parent is selected in the following scenarios: (i) Initial Phase: when a new peer joins the overlay, it periodically adds a new parent until it has min nop parents. (ii) Replacing a Poorly-Performing Parent: when available bandwidth from an existing parent is significantly reduced for a long time or a parent leaves the session, the receiver can select another peer after a random delay.",
        "Each receiver selects a random delay proportional to its available bandwidth from the parent peer [8].",
        "This approach dampens potential oscillation in the overlay while increasing the chance for receivers with higher bandwidth connectivity to keep a parent (i.e., properly reshapes the overlay). (iii) Improvement in Performance: when it is likely that a new parent would significantly improve a non-optimized aspect of performance (increase the bandwidth or decrease the delay).",
        "This strategy allows gradual improvement of the parent subset as new peers are discovered (or joined) the overlay.",
        "The available information for each peer in the image is used as a heuristic to predict performance of a new peer.",
        "Such an improvement should be examined infrequently.",
        "A hysteresis mechanism 5 The target bandwidth is the lower value between maximum stream bandwidth and receivers incoming bandwidth. 46 is implemented in scenario (ii) and (iii) to dampen any potential oscillation in the overlay. 2) Which peer should be selected as a new parent?",
        "At any point of time, peers in the local image are the best known candidate peers to serve as parent.",
        "In PRO, each receiver randomly selects a parent from its current image where the probability of selecting a parent is proportional to its utility.",
        "Deploying this selection strategy by all peers lead to proportional utilization of outgoing bandwidth of all peers without making the selection heavily biased towards high bandwidth peers.",
        "This approach (similar to [5]) leverages heterogeneity among peers since number of children for each peer is proportional to its outgoing bandwidth. 3) How should a new parent be examined?",
        "Each receiver continuously monitors available bandwidth from all parents and potential correlation between bandwidth of two or more connections as signal for shared bottleneck.",
        "The degree of such correlation also reveals the level of multiplexing at the bottleneck link, and could serve as an indicator for separating remote bottlenecks from a local one.",
        "Such a monitoring should use average bandwidth of each flow over a relatively long time scale (e.g., hundreds of RTT) to filter out any transient variations in bandwidth.",
        "To avoid selecting a poorly-performing parent in the near future, the receiver associates a timer to each parent and exponentially backs off the timer after each failed experience [13].",
        "After the initial phase, each receiver maintains a fixed number of parents at any point of time (nopi(t)).",
        "Thus, a new parent should replace one of the active parents.",
        "However, to ensure monotonic improvement in overall performance of active parents, a new parent is always added before one of the existing parents is dropped (i.e., a receiver can temporarily have one extra parent).",
        "Given the available bandwidth from all parents (including the new one) and possible correlation among them, a receiver can use one of the following criteria to drop a parent: (i) to maximize the bandwidth, the receiver can drop the parent that contributes minimum bandwidth, (ii) to maximize path diversity among connections from parents, the receiver should drop the parent that is located behind the same bottleneck with the largest number of active parents and contributes minimum bandwidth among them.",
        "Finally, if the aggregate bandwidth from all parents remains below the required bandwidth after examining certain number of new parents (and nopi(t) < max nop), the receiver can increase the total number of parents by one. 6.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we presented a simple receiver-driven framework for architecting peer-to-pee overlay structures called PRO.",
        "PRO allows each peer to selfishly and independently determine the best way to connect to the overlay to maximize its performance.",
        "Therefore, PRO should be able to maximize delivered quality to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth connectivity.",
        "Both peer discovery and peer selection in this framework are scalable.",

                "PRO is designed for non-interactive streaming applications and its primary design goal is to maximize delivered bandwidth (and thus delivered quality) to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "To achieve this goal, PRO adopts a receiver-driven approach where each receiver (or participating peer) (i) independently discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and (ii) selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own delivered bandwidth.",
                "Participating peers form an unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to high churn rate.",

                "INTRODUCTION Limited deployment of IP multicast has motivated a new distribution paradigm over the Internet based on overlay networks where a group of participating end-systems (or peers) form an overlay structure and actively participate in distribution of content without any special support from the network (e.g., [7]).",
                "Since overlay structures are layered over the best-effort Internet, any approach for constructing overlay should address the following fundamental challenges: (i) Scalability with the number of participating peers, (ii) Robustness to dynamics of peer participation, (iii) Adaptation to variations of network bandwidth, and (iv) Accommodating heterogeneity and asymmetry of bandwidth connectivity among participating peers[19].",
                "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",

                "PRO can accommodate a spectrum of non-interactive streaming applications ranging from playback to lecture-mode live sessions.",
                "The main design philosophy in PRO is that each peer should be allowed to independently and selfishly determine the best way to connect to the overlay in order to maximize its own delivered quality.",
                "Toward this end, each peer can connect to the overlay topology at multiple points (i.e., receive content through multiple parent peers).",
                "Therefore, participating peers form an unstructured overlay that can gracefully cope with high churn rate[5].",
                "Furthermore, having multiple parent peers accommodates bandwidth heterogeneity and asymmetry while improves resiliency against dynamics of peer participation.",
                "PRO consists of two key components: (i) Gossip-based Peer Discovery: Each peer periodically exchanges message (i.e., gossips) with other known peers to progressively learn about a subset of participating peers in the overlay that are likely to be good parents.",
                "Gossiping provides a scalable and efficient approach to peer discovery in unstructured peer-to-peer networks that can be customized to guide direction of discovery towards peers with desired properties (e.g., peers with shorter distance or higher bandwidth). (ii) Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver.",
                "Since the available bandwidth from different participating peers to a receiver (and possible correlation among them) can be measured only at that receiver, a receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers.",

                "REVISITING THE PROBLEM Constructing a peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications should not only accommodate global design goals such as scalability and resilience but also satisfy the local design goal of maximizing delivered quality to individual peers 1 .",
                "More specifically, delivered quality of streaming content to each peer should be proportional to its incoming access link bandwidth.",
                "Achieving these goals is particularly challenging because participating peers often exhibit heterogeneity and asymmetry in their bandwidth connectivity.",
                "Solutions for constructing peer-to-peer overlays often require two key mechanisms to be implemented at each peer: Peer Discovery (PD) and Parent Selection (PS).",

                "Relative delay between any two peers can be estimated in a scalable fashion with one of the existing landmark-based solutions such as Global Network Positioning (GNP) [15].",
                "However, estimating available bandwidth between two peers requires end-to-end measurement.",
                "Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons: First, to cope with dynamics of bandwidth variations, each peer requires to periodically estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through measurement (e.g., [6]).",
                "Second, the probability of interference among different measurements grows with the number of peers in an overlay (similar to joint experiment in RLM [13]).",
                "Most of the previous solutions adopted the idea of application level multicast and used delay as the main selection criteria.",
                "Participating peers cooperatively run a distributed algorithm to organize themselves into a source-rooted tree structure in order to minimize either overall delay across all branches of the tree (e.g., [7]), or delay between source and each receiver peer (e.g., [20]).",
                "While these parent selection strategies minimize associated network load, they may not provide sufficient bandwidth to individual peers because delay is often not a good indicator for available bandwidth between two peers [12, 14].",
                "The key issue is that minimizing overall delay (global design goal) and maximizing delivered bandwidth to each peer (local design goal) could easily be in conflict.",
                "More specifically, parent peers with longer relative distance may provide higher bandwidth than close-by parents.",
                "This suggests that there might exist a tradeoff between maximizing provided bandwidth to each peer and minimizing overall delay across the overlay. (ii) Single vs Multiple Parents: A single tree structure for the overlay (where each peer has a single parent) is inherently unable to accommodate peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "A common approach to accommodating bandwidth heterogeneity is to use layer structured content (either layered or multiple description encodings) and allow each receiver to have multiple parents.",
                "This approach could accommodate heterogeneity but it introduces several new challenges.",
                "First, parent selection strategy should be determined based on location of a bottleneck.",
                "If the bottleneck is at the (outgoing) access links of parent peers 2 , then a receiver should simply look for more parents.",
                "However, when the bottleneck is else where in the network, a receiver should select parents with a diverse set of paths (i.e., utilize different network paths).",
                "In practice, a combination of these cases might simultaneously exist among participating peers [1].",
                "Second, streaming a single content from multiple senders is challenging for two reasons: 1) This requires tight coordination among senders to determine overall delivered quality (e.g., number of layers) and decide which sender is responsible for delivery of each segment. 2) Delivered segments from different senders should arrive before their playout times despite uncorrelated vari2 if bottleneck is at the receivers access link, then provided bandwidth to the receiver is already maximized. 43 ations in (congestion controlled) bandwidth from different senders.",
                "This also implies that those solutions that build multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure in-time delivery of individual segments (e.g., [3, 11]) may not be able to support streaming applications.",
                "One approach to build a multi-parent overlay is to organize participating peers into different trees where each layer of the stream is sent to a separate tree (e.g., [4, 16]).",
                "Each peer can maximize its quality by participating in a proper number of trees.",
                "This approach raises several issues: 1) the provided bandwidth to peers in each tree is limited by minimum uplink bandwidth among upstream peers on that tree.",
                "In the presence of bandwidth asymmetry, this could easily limit delivered bandwidth on each tree below the required bandwidth for a single layer, 2) it is not feasible to build separate trees that are all optimal for a single selection criteria (e.g., overall delay),. 3) connections across different trees are likely to compete for available bandwidth on a single bottleneck3 .",
                "We conclude that a practical solution for peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following design properties: (i) it should use an unstructured, multiparent peer-to-peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver.",

                "PRO is designed for non-interactive streaming applications and its primary design goal is to maximize delivered bandwidth (and thus delivered quality) to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "To achieve this goal, PRO adopts a receiver-driven approach where each receiver (or participating peer) (i) independently discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and (ii) selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own delivered bandwidth.",
                "Participating peers form an unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to high churn rate.",
                "Furthermore, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as implicit signal to detect and react to long-term changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers.",

                "INTRODUCTION Limited deployment of IP multicast has motivated a new distribution paradigm over the Internet based on overlay networks where a group of participating end-systems (or peers) form an overlay structure and actively participate in distribution of content without any special support from the network (e.g., [7]).",
                "Since overlay structures are layered over the best-effort Internet, any approach for constructing overlay should address the following fundamental challenges: (i) Scalability with the number of participating peers, (ii) Robustness to dynamics of peer participation, (iii) Adaptation to variations of network bandwidth, and (iv) Accommodating heterogeneity and asymmetry of bandwidth connectivity among participating peers[19].",
                "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",
                "This paper presents a simple framework for architecting Peer-to-peer Receiver-driven Overlay, called PRO.",
                "PRO can accommodate a spectrum of non-interactive streaming applications ranging from playback to lecture-mode live sessions.",
                "The main design philosophy in PRO is that each peer should be allowed to independently and selfishly determine the best way to connect to the overlay in order to maximize its own delivered quality.",
                "Toward this end, each peer can connect to the overlay topology at multiple points (i.e., receive content through multiple parent peers).",
                "Therefore, participating peers form an unstructured overlay that can gracefully cope with high churn rate[5].",
                "Furthermore, having multiple parent peers accommodates bandwidth heterogeneity and asymmetry while improves resiliency against dynamics of peer participation.",
                "PRO consists of two key components: (i) Gossip-based Peer Discovery: Each peer periodically exchanges message (i.e., gossips) with other known peers to progressively learn about a subset of participating peers in the overlay that are likely to be good parents.",
                "Gossiping provides a scalable and efficient approach to peer discovery in unstructured peer-to-peer networks that can be customized to guide direction of discovery towards peers with desired properties (e.g., peers with shorter distance or higher bandwidth). (ii) Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver.",
                "Since the available bandwidth from different participating peers to a receiver (and possible correlation among them) can be measured only at that receiver, a receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers.",
                "Furthermore, the available bandwidth from parent peers serves as an implicit signal for a receiver to detect and react to changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers.",

                "Thus, PRO and PALS are both receiver-driven but complement each other.",
                "More specifically, PRO determines a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize delivered bandwidth to each receiver whereas PALS coordinates in-time streaming of different segments of multimedia content from these parents despite unpredictable variations in their available bandwidth.",
                "This division of functionality provides a great deal of flexibility because it decouples overlay construction from delivery mechanism.",
                "In this paper, we primarily focus on the overlay construction mechanism, or PRO.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we revisit the problem of overlay construction for peerto-peer streaming and identify its two key components and explore their design space.",

                "Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and presents our future plans. 2.",
                "REVISITING THE PROBLEM Constructing a peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications should not only accommodate global design goals such as scalability and resilience but also satisfy the local design goal of maximizing delivered quality to individual peers 1 .",
                "More specifically, delivered quality of streaming content to each peer should be proportional to its incoming access link bandwidth.",
                "Achieving these goals is particularly challenging because participating peers often exhibit heterogeneity and asymmetry in their bandwidth connectivity.",
                "Solutions for constructing peer-to-peer overlays often require two key mechanisms to be implemented at each peer: Peer Discovery (PD) and Parent Selection (PS).",
                "The PD mechanism enables each peer to learn about other participating peers in the overlay.",
                "Information about other peers are used by the PS mechanism at each peer to determine proper parent peers through which it should connect to the overlay.",
                "The collective behavior of PD and PS mechanisms at all participating peers leads to an overlay structure that achieves the above design goals.",
                "There has been a wealth of previous research that explored design space of the PD and PS mechanisms as follows: Peer Discovery: In structured peer-to-peer networks, the existing structure enables each peer to find other participating peers in a scalable fashion (e.g., [4]).",
                "However, structured peer-to-peer networks may not be robust against high churn rate [5].",
                "In contrast, unstructured peer-to-peer networks can gracefully accommodate high churn rate [5] but require a separate peer discovery mechanism.",
                "Meshfirst approaches (e.g., [7, 6]) that require each peer to know about all other participating peers as well as centralized approaches (e.g., [16]) to peer discovery exhibit limited scalability.",
                "NICE [2] leverages a hierarchal structure to achieve 1 It is worth clarifying that our design goal is different from common goals in building application-level multicast trees [7] (i.e., minimizing stretch and stress). scalability but each peer only knows about a group of closeby peers who may not be good parents (i.e., may not provide sufficient bandwidth).",
                "Parent Selection: We examine two key aspects of parent selections: (i) Selection Criteria: There are two main criteria for parent selections: relative delay and available bandwidth between two peers.",
                "Relative delay between any two peers can be estimated in a scalable fashion with one of the existing landmark-based solutions such as Global Network Positioning (GNP) [15].",
                "However, estimating available bandwidth between two peers requires end-to-end measurement.",
                "Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons: First, to cope with dynamics of bandwidth variations, each peer requires to periodically estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through measurement (e.g., [6]).",
                "Second, the probability of interference among different measurements grows with the number of peers in an overlay (similar to joint experiment in RLM [13]).",
                "Most of the previous solutions adopted the idea of application level multicast and used delay as the main selection criteria.",
                "Participating peers cooperatively run a distributed algorithm to organize themselves into a source-rooted tree structure in order to minimize either overall delay across all branches of the tree (e.g., [7]), or delay between source and each receiver peer (e.g., [20]).",
                "While these parent selection strategies minimize associated network load, they may not provide sufficient bandwidth to individual peers because delay is often not a good indicator for available bandwidth between two peers [12, 14].",
                "The key issue is that minimizing overall delay (global design goal) and maximizing delivered bandwidth to each peer (local design goal) could easily be in conflict.",
                "More specifically, parent peers with longer relative distance may provide higher bandwidth than close-by parents.",
                "This suggests that there might exist a tradeoff between maximizing provided bandwidth to each peer and minimizing overall delay across the overlay. (ii) Single vs Multiple Parents: A single tree structure for the overlay (where each peer has a single parent) is inherently unable to accommodate peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "A common approach to accommodating bandwidth heterogeneity is to use layer structured content (either layered or multiple description encodings) and allow each receiver to have multiple parents.",
                "This approach could accommodate heterogeneity but it introduces several new challenges.",
                "First, parent selection strategy should be determined based on location of a bottleneck.",
                "If the bottleneck is at the (outgoing) access links of parent peers 2 , then a receiver should simply look for more parents.",
                "However, when the bottleneck is else where in the network, a receiver should select parents with a diverse set of paths (i.e., utilize different network paths).",
                "In practice, a combination of these cases might simultaneously exist among participating peers [1].",
                "Second, streaming a single content from multiple senders is challenging for two reasons: 1) This requires tight coordination among senders to determine overall delivered quality (e.g., number of layers) and decide which sender is responsible for delivery of each segment. 2) Delivered segments from different senders should arrive before their playout times despite uncorrelated vari2 if bottleneck is at the receivers access link, then provided bandwidth to the receiver is already maximized. 43 ations in (congestion controlled) bandwidth from different senders.",
                "This also implies that those solutions that build multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure in-time delivery of individual segments (e.g., [3, 11]) may not be able to support streaming applications.",
                "One approach to build a multi-parent overlay is to organize participating peers into different trees where each layer of the stream is sent to a separate tree (e.g., [4, 16]).",
                "Each peer can maximize its quality by participating in a proper number of trees.",
                "This approach raises several issues: 1) the provided bandwidth to peers in each tree is limited by minimum uplink bandwidth among upstream peers on that tree.",
                "In the presence of bandwidth asymmetry, this could easily limit delivered bandwidth on each tree below the required bandwidth for a single layer, 2) it is not feasible to build separate trees that are all optimal for a single selection criteria (e.g., overall delay),. 3) connections across different trees are likely to compete for available bandwidth on a single bottleneck3 .",
                "We conclude that a practical solution for peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following design properties: (i) it should use an unstructured, multiparent peer-to-peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver.",
                "In the next section, we explain how PRO incorporates all the above design properties. 3.",

                "Such a subset of parents may change over time as some parents join (or leave) the overlay, or available bandwidth from current parents significantly changes.",
                "Note that each peer can be both receiver and parent at the same time 4 .",

(ii) estimating available bandwidth requires end-to-end measurement and such a solution does not scale with the number of peers, and more importantly, (iii) given a utility function, this approach enables any peer in the overlay to estimate relative utility of any other two peers.",

                "In PRO, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as an implicit signal to detect two events: (i) any measurable shared bottleneck among connections from different parents, and (ii) any change in network or overlay conditions (e.g., departure or arrival of other close-by peers).",

                "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",

                "Furthermore, having multiple parent peers accommodates bandwidth heterogeneity and asymmetry while improves resiliency against dynamics of peer participation.",
                "PRO consists of two key components: (i) Gossip-based Peer Discovery: Each peer periodically exchanges message (i.e., gossips) with other known peers to progressively learn about a subset of participating peers in the overlay that are likely to be good parents.",
                "Gossiping provides a scalable and efficient approach to peer discovery in unstructured peer-to-peer networks that can be customized to guide direction of discovery towards peers with desired properties (e.g., peers with shorter distance or higher bandwidth). (ii) Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver.",
                "Since the available bandwidth from different participating peers to a receiver (and possible correlation among them) can be measured only at that receiver, a receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers.",

                "More specifically, delivered quality of streaming content to each peer should be proportional to its incoming access link bandwidth.",

                "Information about other peers are used by the PS mechanism at each peer to determine proper parent peers through which it should connect to the overlay.",
                "The collective behavior of PD and PS mechanisms at all participating peers leads to an overlay structure that achieves the above design goals.",
                "There has been a wealth of previous research that explored design space of the PD and PS mechanisms as follows: Peer Discovery: In structured peer-to-peer networks, the existing structure enables each peer to find other participating peers in a scalable fashion (e.g., [4]).",

                "Parent Selection: We examine two key aspects of parent selections: (i) Selection Criteria: There are two main criteria for parent selections: relative delay and available bandwidth between two peers.",
                "Relative delay between any two peers can be estimated in a scalable fashion with one of the existing landmark-based solutions such as Global Network Positioning (GNP) [15].",
                "However, estimating available bandwidth between two peers requires end-to-end measurement.",
                "Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons: First, to cope with dynamics of bandwidth variations, each peer requires to periodically estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through measurement (e.g., [6]).",
                "Second, the probability of interference among different measurements grows with the number of peers in an overlay (similar to joint experiment in RLM [13]).",
                "Most of the previous solutions adopted the idea of application level multicast and used delay as the main selection criteria.",
                "Participating peers cooperatively run a distributed algorithm to organize themselves into a source-rooted tree structure in order to minimize either overall delay across all branches of the tree (e.g., [7]), or delay between source and each receiver peer (e.g., [20]).",
                "While these parent selection strategies minimize associated network load, they may not provide sufficient bandwidth to individual peers because delay is often not a good indicator for available bandwidth between two peers [12, 14].",
                "The key issue is that minimizing overall delay (global design goal) and maximizing delivered bandwidth to each peer (local design goal) could easily be in conflict.",
                "More specifically, parent peers with longer relative distance may provide higher bandwidth than close-by parents.",
                "This suggests that there might exist a tradeoff between maximizing provided bandwidth to each peer and minimizing overall delay across the overlay. (ii) Single vs Multiple Parents: A single tree structure for the overlay (where each peer has a single parent) is inherently unable to accommodate peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "A common approach to accommodating bandwidth heterogeneity is to use layer structured content (either layered or multiple description encodings) and allow each receiver to have multiple parents.",
                "This approach could accommodate heterogeneity but it introduces several new challenges.",
                "First, parent selection strategy should be determined based on location of a bottleneck.",
                "If the bottleneck is at the (outgoing) access links of parent peers 2 , then a receiver should simply look for more parents.",
                "However, when the bottleneck is else where in the network, a receiver should select parents with a diverse set of paths (i.e., utilize different network paths).",
                "In practice, a combination of these cases might simultaneously exist among participating peers [1].",
                "Second, streaming a single content from multiple senders is challenging for two reasons: 1) This requires tight coordination among senders to determine overall delivered quality (e.g., number of layers) and decide which sender is responsible for delivery of each segment. 2) Delivered segments from different senders should arrive before their playout times despite uncorrelated vari2 if bottleneck is at the receivers access link, then provided bandwidth to the receiver is already maximized. 43 ations in (congestion controlled) bandwidth from different senders.",
                "This also implies that those solutions that build multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure in-time delivery of individual segments (e.g., [3, 11]) may not be able to support streaming applications.",
                "One approach to build a multi-parent overlay is to organize participating peers into different trees where each layer of the stream is sent to a separate tree (e.g., [4, 16]).",
                "Each peer can maximize its quality by participating in a proper number of trees.",
                "This approach raises several issues: 1) the provided bandwidth to peers in each tree is limited by minimum uplink bandwidth among upstream peers on that tree.",
                "In the presence of bandwidth asymmetry, this could easily limit delivered bandwidth on each tree below the required bandwidth for a single layer, 2) it is not feasible to build separate trees that are all optimal for a single selection criteria (e.g., overall delay),. 3) connections across different trees are likely to compete for available bandwidth on a single bottleneck3 .",
                "We conclude that a practical solution for peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following design properties: (i) it should use an unstructured, multiparent peer-to-peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver.",

                "To avoid selecting a poorly-performing parent in the near future, the receiver associates a timer to each parent and exponentially backs off the timer after each failed experience [13].",
                "After the initial phase, each receiver maintains a fixed number of parents at any point of time (nopi(t)).",
                "Thus, a new parent should replace one of the active parents.",
                "However, to ensure monotonic improvement in overall performance of active parents, a new parent is always added before one of the existing parents is dropped (i.e., a receiver can temporarily have one extra parent).",
                "Given the available bandwidth from all parents (including the new one) and possible correlation among them, a receiver can use one of the following criteria to drop a parent: (i) to maximize the bandwidth, the receiver can drop the parent that contributes minimum bandwidth, (ii) to maximize path diversity among connections from parents, the receiver should drop the parent that is located behind the same bottleneck with the largest number of active parents and contributes minimum bandwidth among them.",
                "Finally, if the aggregate bandwidth from all parents remains below the required bandwidth after examining certain number of new parents (and nopi(t) < max nop), the receiver can increase the total number of parents by one. 6.",

                "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",

(ii) Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver.",

                "Since overlay structures are layered over the best-effort Internet, any approach for constructing overlay should address the following fundamental challenges: (i) Scalability with the number of participating peers, (ii) Robustness to dynamics of peer participation, (iii) Adaptation to variations of network bandwidth, and (iv) Accommodating heterogeneity and asymmetry of bandwidth connectivity among participating peers[19].",
                "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in <br>design</br> of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",

                "The main <br>design</br> philosophy in PRO is that each peer should be allowed to independently and selfishly determine the best way to connect to the overlay in order to maximize its own delivered quality.",
                "Toward this end, each peer can connect to the overlay topology at multiple points (i.e., receive content through multiple parent peers).",
                "Therefore, participating peers form an unstructured overlay that can gracefully cope with high churn rate[5].",
                "Furthermore, having multiple parent peers accommodates bandwidth heterogeneity and asymmetry while improves resiliency against dynamics of peer participation.",
                "PRO consists of two key components: (i) Gossip-based Peer Discovery: Each peer periodically exchanges message (i.e., gossips) with other known peers to progressively learn about a subset of participating peers in the overlay that are likely to be good parents.",
                "Gossiping provides a scalable and efficient approach to peer discovery in unstructured peer-to-peer networks that can be customized to guide direction of discovery towards peers with desired properties (e.g., peers with shorter distance or higher bandwidth). (ii) Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver.",
                "Since the available bandwidth from different participating peers to a receiver (and possible correlation among them) can be measured only at that receiver, a receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers.",

                "Information about other peers are used by the PS mechanism at each peer to determine proper parent peers through which it should connect to the overlay.",
                "The collective behavior of PD and PS mechanisms at all participating peers leads to an overlay structure that achieves the above <br>design</br> goals.",

                "However, structured peer-to-peer networks may not be robust against high churn rate [5].",
                "In contrast, unstructured peer-to-peer networks can gracefully accommodate high churn rate [5] but require a separate peer discovery mechanism.",
                "Meshfirst approaches (e.g., [7, 6]) that require each peer to know about all other participating peers as well as centralized approaches (e.g., [16]) to peer discovery exhibit limited scalability.",

                "Parent Selection: We examine two key aspects of parent selections: (i) Selection Criteria: There are two main criteria for parent selections: relative delay and available bandwidth between two peers.",
                "Relative delay between any two peers can be estimated in a scalable fashion with one of the existing landmark-based solutions such as Global Network Positioning (GNP) [15].",
                "However, estimating available bandwidth between two peers requires end-to-end measurement.",
                "Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons: First, to cope with dynamics of bandwidth variations, each peer requires to periodically estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through measurement (e.g., [6]).",
                "Second, the probability of interference among different measurements grows with the number of peers in an overlay (similar to joint experiment in RLM [13]).",
                "Most of the previous solutions adopted the idea of application level multicast and used delay as the main selection criteria.",
                "Participating peers cooperatively run a distributed algorithm to organize themselves into a source-rooted tree structure in order to minimize either overall delay across all branches of the tree (e.g., [7]), or delay between source and each receiver peer (e.g., [20]).",
                "While these parent selection strategies minimize associated network load, they may not provide sufficient bandwidth to individual peers because delay is often not a good indicator for available bandwidth between two peers [12, 14].",
                "The key issue is that minimizing overall delay (global <br>design</br> goal) and maximizing delivered bandwidth to each peer (local <br>design</br> goal) could easily be in conflict.",
                "More specifically, parent peers with longer relative distance may provide higher bandwidth than close-by parents.",
                "This suggests that there might exist a tradeoff between maximizing provided bandwidth to each peer and minimizing overall delay across the overlay. (ii) Single vs Multiple Parents: A single tree structure for the overlay (where each peer has a single parent) is inherently unable to accommodate peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "A common approach to accommodating bandwidth heterogeneity is to use layer structured content (either layered or multiple description encodings) and allow each receiver to have multiple parents.",
                "This approach could accommodate heterogeneity but it introduces several new challenges.",
                "First, parent selection strategy should be determined based on location of a bottleneck.",
                "If the bottleneck is at the (outgoing) access links of parent peers 2 , then a receiver should simply look for more parents.",
                "However, when the bottleneck is else where in the network, a receiver should select parents with a diverse set of paths (i.e., utilize different network paths).",
                "In practice, a combination of these cases might simultaneously exist among participating peers [1].",
                "Second, streaming a single content from multiple senders is challenging for two reasons: 1) This requires tight coordination among senders to determine overall delivered quality (e.g., number of layers) and decide which sender is responsible for delivery of each segment. 2) Delivered segments from different senders should arrive before their playout times despite uncorrelated vari2 if bottleneck is at the receivers access link, then provided bandwidth to the receiver is already maximized. 43 ations in (congestion controlled) bandwidth from different senders.",
                "This also implies that those solutions that build multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure in-time delivery of individual segments (e.g., [3, 11]) may not be able to support streaming applications.",
                "One approach to build a multi-parent overlay is to organize participating peers into different trees where each layer of the stream is sent to a separate tree (e.g., [4, 16]).",
                "Each peer can maximize its quality by participating in a proper number of trees.",
                "This approach raises several issues: 1) the provided bandwidth to peers in each tree is limited by minimum uplink bandwidth among upstream peers on that tree.",
                "In the presence of bandwidth asymmetry, this could easily limit delivered bandwidth on each tree below the required bandwidth for a single layer, 2) it is not feasible to build separate trees that are all optimal for a single selection criteria (e.g., overall delay),. 3) connections across different trees are likely to compete for available bandwidth on a single bottleneck3 .",
                "We conclude that a practical solution for peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following <br>design</br> properties: (i) it should use an unstructured, multiparent peer-to-peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver.",

                "PRO is designed for non-interactive streaming applications and its primary design goal is to maximize delivered bandwidth (and thus delivered quality) to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "To achieve this goal, PRO adopts a receiver-driven approach where each receiver (or participating peer) (i) independently discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and (ii) selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own delivered bandwidth.",
                "Participating peers form an unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to high churn rate.",
                "Furthermore, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as implicit signal to detect and react to long-term changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers.",
                "Independent parent selection by individual peers dynamically converge to an efficient overlay structure.",

                "INTRODUCTION Limited deployment of IP multicast has motivated a new distribution paradigm over the Internet based on overlay networks where a group of participating end-systems (or peers) form an overlay structure and actively participate in distribution of content without any special support from the network (e.g., [7]).",
                "Since overlay structures are layered over the best-effort Internet, any approach for constructing overlay should address the following fundamental challenges: (i) Scalability with the number of participating peers, (ii) Robustness to dynamics of peer participation, (iii) Adaptation to variations of network bandwidth, and (iv) Accommodating heterogeneity and asymmetry of bandwidth connectivity among participating peers[19].",
                "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",
                "This paper presents a simple framework for architecting Peer-to-peer Receiver-driven Overlay, called PRO.",
                "PRO can accommodate a spectrum of non-interactive streaming applications ranging from playback to lecture-mode live sessions.",
                "The main design philosophy in PRO is that each peer should be allowed to independently and selfishly determine the best way to connect to the overlay in order to maximize its own delivered quality.",
                "Toward this end, each peer can connect to the overlay topology at multiple points (i.e., receive content through multiple parent peers).",
                "Therefore, participating peers form an unstructured overlay that can gracefully cope with high churn rate[5].",
                "Furthermore, having multiple parent peers accommodates bandwidth heterogeneity and asymmetry while improves resiliency against dynamics of peer participation.",
                "PRO consists of two key components: (i) Gossip-based Peer Discovery: Each peer periodically exchanges message (i.e., gossips) with other known peers to progressively learn about a subset of participating peers in the overlay that are likely to be good parents.",
                "Gossiping provides a scalable and efficient approach to peer discovery in unstructured peer-to-peer networks that can be customized to guide direction of discovery towards peers with desired properties (e.g., peers with shorter distance or higher bandwidth). (ii) Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver.",
                "Since the available bandwidth from different participating peers to a receiver (and possible correlation among them) can be measured only at that receiver, a receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers.",
                "Furthermore, the available bandwidth from parent peers serves as an implicit signal for a receiver to detect and react to changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers.",
                "Independent parent selection by individual peers leads to an efficient overlay that maximizes delivered quality to each peer.",
                "PRO incorporates 42 several damping functions to ensure stability of the overlay despite uncoordinated actions by different peers.",
                "PRO is part of a larger architecture that we have developed for peer-to-peer streaming.",
                "In our earlier work, we developed a mechanism called PALS [18] that enables a receiver to stream layered structured content from a given set of congestion controlled senders.",
                "Thus, PRO and PALS are both receiver-driven but complement each other.",
                "More specifically, PRO determines a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize delivered bandwidth to each receiver whereas PALS coordinates in-time streaming of different segments of multimedia content from these parents despite unpredictable variations in their available bandwidth.",
                "This division of functionality provides a great deal of flexibility because it decouples overlay construction from delivery mechanism.",
                "In this paper, we primarily focus on the overlay construction mechanism, or PRO.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we revisit the problem of overlay construction for peerto-peer streaming and identify its two key components and explore their design space.",
                "We illustrate the differences between PRO and previous solutions, and justify our design choices.",
                "We present our proposed framework in Section 3.",
                "In Sections 4 and 5, the key components of our framework are described in further detail.",
                "Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and presents our future plans. 2.",
                "REVISITING THE PROBLEM Constructing a peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications should not only accommodate global design goals such as scalability and resilience but also satisfy the local design goal of maximizing delivered quality to individual peers 1 .",
                "More specifically, delivered quality of streaming content to each peer should be proportional to its incoming access link bandwidth.",
                "Achieving these goals is particularly challenging because participating peers often exhibit heterogeneity and asymmetry in their bandwidth connectivity.",
                "Solutions for constructing peer-to-peer overlays often require two key mechanisms to be implemented at each peer: Peer Discovery (PD) and Parent Selection (PS).",
                "The PD mechanism enables each peer to learn about other participating peers in the overlay.",
                "Information about other peers are used by the PS mechanism at each peer to determine proper parent peers through which it should connect to the overlay.",
                "The collective behavior of PD and PS mechanisms at all participating peers leads to an overlay structure that achieves the above design goals.",
                "There has been a wealth of previous research that explored design space of the PD and PS mechanisms as follows: Peer Discovery: In structured peer-to-peer networks, the existing structure enables each peer to find other participating peers in a scalable fashion (e.g., [4]).",
                "However, structured peer-to-peer networks may not be robust against high churn rate [5].",
                "In contrast, unstructured peer-to-peer networks can gracefully accommodate high churn rate [5] but require a separate peer discovery mechanism.",
                "Meshfirst approaches (e.g., [7, 6]) that require each peer to know about all other participating peers as well as centralized approaches (e.g., [16]) to peer discovery exhibit limited scalability.",
                "NICE [2] leverages a hierarchal structure to achieve 1 It is worth clarifying that our design goal is different from common goals in building application-level multicast trees [7] (i.e., minimizing stretch and stress). scalability but each peer only knows about a group of closeby peers who may not be good parents (i.e., may not provide sufficient bandwidth).",
                "Parent Selection: We examine two key aspects of parent selections: (i) Selection Criteria: There are two main criteria for parent selections: relative delay and available bandwidth between two peers.",
                "Relative delay between any two peers can be estimated in a scalable fashion with one of the existing landmark-based solutions such as Global Network Positioning (GNP) [15].",
                "However, estimating available bandwidth between two peers requires end-to-end <br>measurement</br>.",
                "Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons: First, to cope with dynamics of bandwidth variations, each peer requires to periodically estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through <br>measurement</br> (e.g., [6]).",
                "Second, the probability of interference among different measurements grows with the number of peers in an overlay (similar to joint experiment in RLM [13]).",
                "Most of the previous solutions adopted the idea of application level multicast and used delay as the main selection criteria.",
                "Participating peers cooperatively run a distributed algorithm to organize themselves into a source-rooted tree structure in order to minimize either overall delay across all branches of the tree (e.g., [7]), or delay between source and each receiver peer (e.g., [20]).",
                "While these parent selection strategies minimize associated network load, they may not provide sufficient bandwidth to individual peers because delay is often not a good indicator for available bandwidth between two peers [12, 14].",
                "The key issue is that minimizing overall delay (global design goal) and maximizing delivered bandwidth to each peer (local design goal) could easily be in conflict.",
                "More specifically, parent peers with longer relative distance may provide higher bandwidth than close-by parents.",
                "This suggests that there might exist a tradeoff between maximizing provided bandwidth to each peer and minimizing overall delay across the overlay. (ii) Single vs Multiple Parents: A single tree structure for the overlay (where each peer has a single parent) is inherently unable to accommodate peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "A common approach to accommodating bandwidth heterogeneity is to use layer structured content (either layered or multiple description encodings) and allow each receiver to have multiple parents.",
                "This approach could accommodate heterogeneity but it introduces several new challenges.",
                "First, parent selection strategy should be determined based on location of a bottleneck.",
                "If the bottleneck is at the (outgoing) access links of parent peers 2 , then a receiver should simply look for more parents.",
                "However, when the bottleneck is else where in the network, a receiver should select parents with a diverse set of paths (i.e., utilize different network paths).",
                "In practice, a combination of these cases might simultaneously exist among participating peers [1].",
                "Second, streaming a single content from multiple senders is challenging for two reasons: 1) This requires tight coordination among senders to determine overall delivered quality (e.g., number of layers) and decide which sender is responsible for delivery of each segment. 2) Delivered segments from different senders should arrive before their playout times despite uncorrelated vari2 if bottleneck is at the receivers access link, then provided bandwidth to the receiver is already maximized. 43 ations in (congestion controlled) bandwidth from different senders.",
                "This also implies that those solutions that build multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure in-time delivery of individual segments (e.g., [3, 11]) may not be able to support streaming applications.",
                "One approach to build a multi-parent overlay is to organize participating peers into different trees where each layer of the stream is sent to a separate tree (e.g., [4, 16]).",
                "Each peer can maximize its quality by participating in a proper number of trees.",
                "This approach raises several issues: 1) the provided bandwidth to peers in each tree is limited by minimum uplink bandwidth among upstream peers on that tree.",
                "In the presence of bandwidth asymmetry, this could easily limit delivered bandwidth on each tree below the required bandwidth for a single layer, 2) it is not feasible to build separate trees that are all optimal for a single selection criteria (e.g., overall delay),. 3) connections across different trees are likely to compete for available bandwidth on a single bottleneck3 .",
                "We conclude that a practical solution for peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following design properties: (i) it should use an unstructured, multiparent peer-to-peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver.",
                "In the next section, we explain how PRO incorporates all the above design properties. 3.",

                "Such a subset of parents may change over time as some parents join (or leave) the overlay, or available bandwidth from current parents significantly changes.",
                "Note that each peer can be both receiver and parent at the same time 4 .",

(ii) estimating available bandwidth requires end-to-end <br>measurement</br> and such a solution does not scale with the number of peers, and more importantly, (iii) given a utility function, this approach enables any peer in the overlay to estimate relative utility of any other two peers.",

                "Finally, if the aggregate bandwidth from all parents remains below the required bandwidth after examining certain number of new parents (and nopi(t) < max nop), the receiver can increase the total number of parents by one. 6.",

                "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",

(ii) Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver.",

                "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",

                "Gossiping provides a scalable and efficient approach to peer discovery in unstructured peer-to-peer networks that can be customized to guide direction of discovery towards peers with desired properties (e.g., peers with shorter distance or higher bandwidth). (ii) Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver.",
                "Since the available bandwidth from different participating peers to a receiver (and possible correlation among them) can be measured only at that receiver, a receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers.",

                "Relative delay between any two peers can be estimated in a scalable fashion with one of the existing landmark-based solutions such as Global Network Positioning (GNP) [15].",
                "However, estimating available bandwidth between two peers requires end-to-end measurement.",
                "Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons: First, to cope with dynamics of bandwidth variations, each peer requires to periodically estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through measurement (e.g., [6]).",
                "Second, the probability of interference among different measurements grows with the number of peers in an overlay (similar to joint experiment in RLM [13]).",
                "Most of the previous solutions adopted the idea of application level multicast and used delay as the main selection criteria.",
                "Participating peers cooperatively run a distributed algorithm to organize themselves into a source-rooted tree structure in order to minimize either overall delay across all branches of the tree (e.g., [7]), or delay between source and each receiver peer (e.g., [20]).",
                "While these parent selection strategies minimize associated network load, they may not provide sufficient bandwidth to individual peers because delay is often not a good indicator for available bandwidth between two peers [12, 14].",
                "The key issue is that minimizing overall delay (global design goal) and maximizing delivered bandwidth to each peer (local design goal) could easily be in conflict.",
                "More specifically, parent peers with longer relative distance may provide higher bandwidth than close-by parents.",
                "This suggests that there might exist a tradeoff between maximizing provided bandwidth to each peer and minimizing overall delay across the overlay. (ii) Single vs Multiple Parents: A single tree structure for the overlay (where each peer has a single parent) is inherently unable to accommodate peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "A common approach to accommodating bandwidth heterogeneity is to use layer structured content (either layered or multiple description encodings) and allow each receiver to have multiple parents.",
                "This approach could accommodate heterogeneity but it introduces several new challenges.",
                "First, parent selection strategy should be determined based on location of a bottleneck.",
                "If the bottleneck is at the (outgoing) access links of parent peers 2 , then a receiver should simply look for more parents.",
                "However, when the bottleneck is else where in the network, a receiver should select parents with a diverse set of paths (i.e., utilize different network paths).",
                "In practice, a combination of these cases might simultaneously exist among participating peers [1].",
                "Second, streaming a single content from multiple senders is challenging for two reasons: 1) This requires tight coordination among senders to determine overall delivered quality (e.g., number of layers) and decide which sender is responsible for delivery of each segment. 2) Delivered segments from different senders should arrive before their playout times despite uncorrelated vari2 if bottleneck is at the receivers access link, then provided bandwidth to the receiver is already maximized. 43 ations in (congestion controlled) bandwidth from different senders.",
                "This also implies that those solutions that build multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure in-time delivery of individual segments (e.g., [3, 11]) may not be able to support streaming applications.",
                "One approach to build a multi-parent overlay is to organize participating peers into different trees where each layer of the stream is sent to a separate tree (e.g., [4, 16]).",
                "Each peer can maximize its quality by participating in a proper number of trees.",
                "This approach raises several issues: 1) the provided bandwidth to peers in each tree is limited by minimum uplink bandwidth among upstream peers on that tree.",
                "In the presence of bandwidth asymmetry, this could easily limit delivered bandwidth on each tree below the required bandwidth for a single layer, 2) it is not feasible to build separate trees that are all optimal for a single selection criteria (e.g., overall delay),. 3) connections across different trees are likely to compete for available bandwidth on a single bottleneck3 .",
                "We conclude that a practical solution for peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following design properties: (i) it should use an unstructured, multiparent peer-to-peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver.",

                "The degree of such correlation also reveals the level of multiplexing at the bottleneck link, and could serve as an indicator for separating remote bottlenecks from a local one.",
                "Such a monitoring should use average bandwidth of each flow over a relatively long time scale (e.g., hundreds of RTT) to filter out any transient variations in bandwidth.",
                "To avoid selecting a poorly-performing parent in the near future, the receiver associates a timer to each parent and exponentially backs off the timer after each failed experience [13].",

                "Thus, a new parent should replace one of the active parents.",
                "However, to ensure monotonic improvement in overall performance of active parents, a new parent is always added before one of the existing parents is dropped (i.e., a receiver can temporarily have one extra parent).",
                "Given the available bandwidth from all parents (including the new one) and possible correlation among them, a receiver can use one of the following criteria to drop a parent: (i) to maximize the bandwidth, the receiver can drop the parent that contributes minimum bandwidth, (ii) to maximize path diversity among connections from parents, the receiver should drop the parent that is located behind the same bottleneck with the largest number of active parents and contributes minimum bandwidth among them.",
                "Finally, if the aggregate bandwidth from all parents remains below the required bandwidth after examining certain number of new parents (and nopi(t) < max nop), the receiver can increase the total number of parents by one. 6.",

                "PRO is designed for non-interactive streaming applications and its primary design goal is to maximize delivered bandwidth (and thus delivered quality) to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "To achieve this goal, PRO adopts a receiver-driven approach where each receiver (or participating peer) (i) independently discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and (ii) selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own delivered bandwidth.",
                "Participating peers form an unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to high churn rate.",
                "Furthermore, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as implicit signal to detect and react to long-term changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers.",

                "Categories and Subject Descriptors: C.2.4 [ComputerCommunication Networks]: Distributed Systems General Terms: Design, Measurement 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Limited deployment of IP multicast has motivated a new distribution paradigm over the Internet based on overlay networks where a group of participating end-systems (or peers) form an overlay structure and actively participate in distribution of content without any special support from the network (e.g., [7]).",
                "Since overlay structures are layered over the best-effort Internet, any approach for constructing overlay should address the following fundamental challenges: (i) Scalability with the number of participating peers, (ii) Robustness to dynamics of peer participation, (iii) Adaptation to variations of network bandwidth, and (iv) Accommodating heterogeneity and asymmetry of bandwidth connectivity among participating peers[19].",
                "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",
                "This paper presents a simple framework for architecting Peer-to-peer Receiver-driven Overlay, called PRO.",
                "PRO can accommodate a spectrum of non-interactive streaming applications ranging from playback to lecture-mode live sessions.",
                "The main design philosophy in PRO is that each peer should be allowed to independently and selfishly determine the best way to connect to the overlay in order to maximize its own delivered quality.",
                "Toward this end, each peer can connect to the overlay topology at multiple points (i.e., receive content through multiple parent peers).",
                "Therefore, participating peers form an unstructured overlay that can gracefully cope with high churn rate[5].",
                "Furthermore, having multiple parent peers accommodates bandwidth heterogeneity and asymmetry while improves resiliency against dynamics of peer participation.",
                "PRO consists of two key components: (i) Gossip-based Peer Discovery: Each peer periodically exchanges message (i.e., gossips) with other known peers to progressively learn about a subset of participating peers in the overlay that are likely to be good parents.",
                "Gossiping provides a scalable and efficient approach to peer discovery in unstructured peer-to-peer networks that can be customized to guide direction of discovery towards peers with desired properties (e.g., peers with shorter distance or higher bandwidth). (ii) Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a <br>proper subset of parent peer</br>s that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver.",
                "Since the available bandwidth from different participating peers to a receiver (and possible correlation among them) can be measured only at that receiver, a receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers.",
                "Furthermore, the available bandwidth from parent peers serves as an implicit signal for a receiver to detect and react to changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers.",

                "In our earlier work, we developed a mechanism called PALS [18] that enables a receiver to stream layered structured content from a given set of congestion controlled senders.",
                "Thus, PRO and PALS are both receiver-driven but complement each other.",
                "More specifically, PRO determines a <br>proper subset of parent peer</br>s that collectively maximize delivered bandwidth to each receiver whereas PALS coordinates in-time streaming of different segments of multimedia content from these parents despite unpredictable variations in their available bandwidth.",
                "This division of functionality provides a great deal of flexibility because it decouples overlay construction from delivery mechanism.",
                "In this paper, we primarily focus on the overlay construction mechanism, or PRO.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we revisit the problem of overlay construction for peerto-peer streaming and identify its two key components and explore their design space.",
                "We illustrate the differences between PRO and previous solutions, and justify our design choices.",
                "We present our proposed framework in Section 3.",

                "Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and presents our future plans. 2.",
                "REVISITING THE PROBLEM Constructing a peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications should not only accommodate global design goals such as scalability and resilience but also satisfy the local design goal of maximizing delivered quality to individual peers 1 .",
                "More specifically, delivered quality of streaming content to each peer should be proportional to its incoming access link bandwidth.",
                "Achieving these goals is particularly challenging because participating peers often exhibit heterogeneity and asymmetry in their bandwidth connectivity.",
                "Solutions for constructing peer-to-peer overlays often require two key mechanisms to be implemented at each peer: Peer Discovery (PD) and Parent Selection (PS).",
                "The PD mechanism enables each peer to learn about other participating peers in the overlay.",
                "Information about other peers are used by the PS mechanism at each peer to determine proper parent peers through which it should connect to the overlay.",
                "The collective behavior of PD and PS mechanisms at all participating peers leads to an overlay structure that achieves the above design goals.",
                "There has been a wealth of previous research that explored design space of the PD and PS mechanisms as follows: Peer Discovery: In structured peer-to-peer networks, the existing structure enables each peer to find other participating peers in a scalable fashion (e.g., [4]).",
                "However, structured peer-to-peer networks may not be robust against high churn rate [5].",
                "In contrast, unstructured peer-to-peer networks can gracefully accommodate high churn rate [5] but require a separate peer discovery mechanism.",
                "Meshfirst approaches (e.g., [7, 6]) that require each peer to know about all other participating peers as well as centralized approaches (e.g., [16]) to peer discovery exhibit limited scalability.",
                "NICE [2] leverages a hierarchal structure to achieve 1 It is worth clarifying that our design goal is different from common goals in building application-level multicast trees [7] (i.e., minimizing stretch and stress). scalability but each peer only knows about a group of closeby peers who may not be good parents (i.e., may not provide sufficient bandwidth).",
                "Parent Selection: We examine two key aspects of parent selections: (i) Selection Criteria: There are two main criteria for parent selections: relative delay and available bandwidth between two peers.",
                "Relative delay between any two peers can be estimated in a scalable fashion with one of the existing landmark-based solutions such as Global Network Positioning (GNP) [15].",
                "However, estimating available bandwidth between two peers requires end-to-end measurement.",
                "Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons: First, to cope with dynamics of bandwidth variations, each peer requires to periodically estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through measurement (e.g., [6]).",
                "Second, the probability of interference among different measurements grows with the number of peers in an overlay (similar to joint experiment in RLM [13]).",
                "Most of the previous solutions adopted the idea of application level multicast and used delay as the main selection criteria.",
                "Participating peers cooperatively run a distributed algorithm to organize themselves into a source-rooted tree structure in order to minimize either overall delay across all branches of the tree (e.g., [7]), or delay between source and each receiver peer (e.g., [20]).",
                "While these parent selection strategies minimize associated network load, they may not provide sufficient bandwidth to individual peers because delay is often not a good indicator for available bandwidth between two peers [12, 14].",
                "The key issue is that minimizing overall delay (global design goal) and maximizing delivered bandwidth to each peer (local design goal) could easily be in conflict.",
                "More specifically, parent peers with longer relative distance may provide higher bandwidth than close-by parents.",
                "This suggests that there might exist a tradeoff between maximizing provided bandwidth to each peer and minimizing overall delay across the overlay. (ii) Single vs Multiple Parents: A single tree structure for the overlay (where each peer has a single parent) is inherently unable to accommodate peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "A common approach to accommodating bandwidth heterogeneity is to use layer structured content (either layered or multiple description encodings) and allow each receiver to have multiple parents.",
                "This approach could accommodate heterogeneity but it introduces several new challenges.",
                "First, parent selection strategy should be determined based on location of a bottleneck.",
                "If the bottleneck is at the (outgoing) access links of parent peers 2 , then a receiver should simply look for more parents.",
                "However, when the bottleneck is else where in the network, a receiver should select parents with a diverse set of paths (i.e., utilize different network paths).",
                "In practice, a combination of these cases might simultaneously exist among participating peers [1].",
                "Second, streaming a single content from multiple senders is challenging for two reasons: 1) This requires tight coordination among senders to determine overall delivered quality (e.g., number of layers) and decide which sender is responsible for delivery of each segment. 2) Delivered segments from different senders should arrive before their playout times despite uncorrelated vari2 if bottleneck is at the receivers access link, then provided bandwidth to the receiver is already maximized. 43 ations in (congestion controlled) bandwidth from different senders.",
                "This also implies that those solutions that build multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure in-time delivery of individual segments (e.g., [3, 11]) may not be able to support streaming applications.",
                "One approach to build a multi-parent overlay is to organize participating peers into different trees where each layer of the stream is sent to a separate tree (e.g., [4, 16]).",
                "Each peer can maximize its quality by participating in a proper number of trees.",
                "This approach raises several issues: 1) the provided bandwidth to peers in each tree is limited by minimum uplink bandwidth among upstream peers on that tree.",
                "In the presence of bandwidth asymmetry, this could easily limit delivered bandwidth on each tree below the required bandwidth for a single layer, 2) it is not feasible to build separate trees that are all optimal for a single selection criteria (e.g., overall delay),. 3) connections across different trees are likely to compete for available bandwidth on a single bottleneck3 .",
                "We conclude that a practical solution for peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following design properties: (i) it should use an unstructured, multiparent peer-to-peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver.",
                "In the next section, we explain how PRO incorporates all the above design properties. 3.",

                "Furthermore, peers may join and leave in an arbitrary fashion.",
                "Overview: In PRO, each peer (or receiver) progressively searches for a subset of parents that collectively maximize delivered bandwidth and minimize overall delay from all parents to the receiver.",
                "Such a subset of parents may change over time as some parents join (or leave) the overlay, or available bandwidth from current parents significantly changes.",
                "Note that each peer can be both receiver and parent at the same time 4 .",
                "Each receiver periodically exchanges messages (i.e., gossips) with other peers in the overlay to learn about those participating peers that are potentially good parents.",
                "Potentially good parents for a receiver are identified based on their relative utility for the receiver.",
                "The utility of a parent peer pi for a receiver pj is a function of their relative network distance (delij) and the outgoing access link bandwidth of the parent (outbwi), (i.e., U(pi, pj) 3 These multi-tree approaches often do not use congestion control for each connection. 4 Throughout this paper we use receiver and parent as short form for receiver peer and parent peer. = f(delij, outbwi)).",
                "Using parents access link bandwidth instead of available bandwidth has several advantages: (i) outgoing bandwidth is an upper bound for available bandwidth from a parent.",
                "Therefore, it enables the receiver to roughly classify different parents. (ii) estimating available bandwidth requires end-to-end measurement and such a solution does not scale with the number of peers, and more importantly, (iii) given a utility function, this approach enables any peer in the overlay to estimate relative utility of any other two peers.",
                "Each receiver only maintains information about a fixed (and relatively small) number of promising parent peers in its local image.",
                "The local image at each receiver is dynamically updated with new gossip messages as other peers join/leave the overlay.",
                "Each peer selects a new parent in a demand-driven fashion in order to minimize the number of end-to-end bandwidth measurements, and thus improve scalability.",
                "When a receiver needs a new parent, its PS mechanism randomly selects a peer from its local image where probability of selecting a peer directly depends on its utility.",
                "Then, the actual properties (i.e., available bandwidth and delay) of the selected parent are verified through passive measurement.",
                "Toward this end, the selected parent is added to the parent list which triggers PALS to request content from this parent.",
                "Figure 1 depicts the interactions between PD and PS mechanisms.",
                "In PRO, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as an implicit signal to detect two events: (i) any measurable shared bottleneck among connections from different parents, and (ii) any change in network or overlay conditions (e.g., departure or arrival of other close-by peers).",

                "Such a monitoring should use average bandwidth of each flow over a relatively long time scale (e.g., hundreds of RTT) to filter out any transient variations in bandwidth.",
                "To avoid selecting a poorly-performing parent in the near future, the receiver associates a timer to each parent and exponentially backs off the timer after each failed experience [13].",
                "After the initial phase, each receiver maintains a fixed number of parents at any point of time (nopi(t)).",
                "Thus, a new parent should replace one of the active parents.",
                "However, to ensure monotonic improvement in overall performance of active parents, a new parent is always added before one of the existing parents is dropped (i.e., a receiver can temporarily have one extra parent).",
                "Given the available bandwidth from all parents (including the new one) and possible correlation among them, a receiver can use one of the following criteria to drop a parent: (i) to maximize the bandwidth, the receiver can drop the parent that contributes minimum bandwidth, (ii) to maximize path diversity among connections from parents, the receiver should drop the parent that is located behind the same bottleneck with the largest number of active parents and contributes minimum bandwidth among them.",
                "Finally, if the aggregate bandwidth from all parents remains below the required bandwidth after examining certain number of new parents (and nopi(t) < max nop), the receiver can increase the total number of parents by one. 6.",

                "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",

                "Coping with bandwidth variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.",

(ii) <br>receiver-driven parent selection</br>: Given the collected information about other participating peers by gossiping mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset of parent peers that collectively maximize provided bandwidth to the receiver.",

                "Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons: First, to cope with dynamics of bandwidth variations, each peer requires to periodically estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through measurement (e.g., [6]).",
                "Second, the probability of interference among different measurements grows with the number of peers in an overlay (similar to joint experiment in RLM [13]).",
                "Most of the previous solutions adopted the idea of application level multicast and used delay as the main selection criteria.",
                "Participating peers cooperatively run a distributed algorithm to organize themselves into a source-rooted tree structure in order to minimize either overall delay across all branches of the tree (e.g., [7]), or delay between source and each receiver peer (e.g., [20]).",
                "While these parent selection strategies minimize associated network load, they may not provide sufficient bandwidth to individual peers because delay is often not a good indicator for available bandwidth between two peers [12, 14].",
                "The key issue is that minimizing overall delay (global design goal) and maximizing delivered bandwidth to each peer (local design goal) could easily be in conflict.",
                "More specifically, parent peers with longer relative distance may provide higher bandwidth than close-by parents.",
                "This suggests that there might exist a tradeoff between maximizing provided bandwidth to each peer and minimizing overall delay across the overlay. (ii) Single vs Multiple Parents: A single tree structure for the overlay (where each peer has a single parent) is inherently unable to accommodate peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.",
                "A common approach to accommodating bandwidth heterogeneity is to use layer structured content (either layered or multiple description encodings) and allow each receiver to have multiple parents.",
                "This approach could accommodate heterogeneity but it introduces several new challenges.",
                "First, parent selection strategy should be determined based on location of a bottleneck.",
                "If the bottleneck is at the (outgoing) access links of parent peers 2 , then a receiver should simply look for more parents.",
                "However, when the bottleneck is else where in the network, a receiver should select parents with a diverse set of paths (i.e., utilize different network paths).",
                "In practice, a combination of these cases might simultaneously exist among participating peers [1].",
                "Second, streaming a single content from multiple senders is challenging for two reasons: 1) This requires tight coordination among senders to determine overall delivered quality (e.g., number of layers) and decide which sender is responsible for delivery of each segment. 2) Delivered segments from different senders should arrive before their playout times despite uncorrelated vari2 if bottleneck is at the receivers access link, then provided bandwidth to the receiver is already maximized. 43 ations in (congestion controlled) bandwidth from different senders.",
                "This also implies that those solutions that build multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure in-time delivery of individual segments (e.g., [3, 11]) may not be able to support streaming applications.",
                "One approach to build a multi-parent overlay is to organize participating peers into different trees where each layer of the stream is sent to a separate tree (e.g., [4, 16]).",
                "Each peer can maximize its quality by participating in a proper number of trees.",
                "This approach raises several issues: 1) the provided bandwidth to peers in each tree is limited by minimum uplink bandwidth among upstream peers on that tree.",
                "In the presence of bandwidth asymmetry, this could easily limit delivered bandwidth on each tree below the required bandwidth for a single layer, 2) it is not feasible to build separate trees that are all optimal for a single selection criteria (e.g., overall delay),. 3) connections across different trees are likely to compete for available bandwidth on a single bottleneck3 .",
                "We conclude that a practical solution for peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following design properties: (i) it should use an unstructured, multiparent peer-to-peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver.",

                "The degree of such correlation also reveals the level of multiplexing at the bottleneck link, and could serve as an indicator for separating remote bottlenecks from a local one.",
                "Such a monitoring should use average bandwidth of each flow over a relatively long time scale (e.g., hundreds of RTT) to filter out any transient variations in bandwidth.",
                "To avoid selecting a poorly-performing parent in the near future, the receiver associates a timer to each parent and exponentially backs off the timer after each failed experience [13].",
                "After the initial phase, each receiver maintains a fixed number of parents at any point of time (nopi(t)).",
                "Thus, a new parent should replace one of the active parents.",
                "However, to ensure monotonic improvement in overall performance of active parents, a new parent is always added before one of the existing parents is dropped (i.e., a receiver can temporarily have one extra parent).",
                "Given the available bandwidth from all parents (including the new one) and possible correlation among them, a receiver can use one of the following criteria to drop a parent: (i) to maximize the bandwidth, the receiver can drop the parent that contributes minimum bandwidth, (ii) to maximize path diversity among connections from parents, the receiver should drop the parent that is located behind the same bottleneck with the largest number of active parents and contributes minimum bandwidth among them.",
                "Finally, if the aggregate bandwidth from all parents remains below the required bandwidth after examining certain number of new parents (and nopi(t) < max nop), the receiver can increase the total number of parents by one. 6.",

                "A new parent is selected in the following scenarios: (i) Initial Phase: when a new peer joins the overlay, it periodically adds a new parent until it has min nop parents. (ii) Replacing a Poorly-Performing Parent: when available bandwidth from an existing parent is significantly reduced for a long time or a parent leaves the session, the receiver can select another peer after a random delay.",
                "Each receiver selects a random delay proportional to its available bandwidth from the parent peer [8].",
                "This approach dampens potential oscillation in the overlay while increasing the chance for receivers with higher bandwidth connectivity to keep a parent (i.e., properly reshapes the overlay). (iii) Improvement in Performance: when it is likely that a new parent would significantly improve a non-optimized aspect of performance (increase the bandwidth or decrease the delay).",
                "This strategy allows gradual improvement of the parent subset as new peers are discovered (or joined) the overlay.",
                "The available information for each peer in the image is used as a heuristic to predict performance of a new peer.",
                "Such an improvement should be examined infrequently.",
                "A hysteresis mechanism 5 The target bandwidth is the lower value between maximum stream bandwidth and receivers incoming bandwidth. 46 is implemented in scenario (ii) and (iii) to dampen any potential oscillation in the overlay. 2) Which peer should be selected as a new parent?",
                "At any point of time, peers in the local image are the best known candidate peers to serve as parent.",
                "In PRO, each receiver randomly selects a parent from its current image where the probability of selecting a parent is proportional to its utility.",
                "Deploying this selection strategy by all peers lead to proportional utilization of outgoing bandwidth of all peers without making the selection heavily biased towards high bandwidth peers.",
                "This approach (similar to [5]) leverages heterogeneity among peers since number of children for each peer is proportional to its outgoing bandwidth. 3) How should a new parent be examined?",
                "Each receiver continuously monitors available bandwidth from all parents and potential correlation between bandwidth of two or more connections as signal for shared bottleneck.",
                "The degree of such correlation also reveals the level of multiplexing at the bottleneck link, and could serve as an indicator for separating remote bottlenecks from a local one.",
                "Such a monitoring should use average bandwidth of each flow over a relatively long time scale (e.g., hundreds of RTT) to filter out any transient variations in bandwidth.",
                "To avoid selecting a poorly-performing parent in the near future, the receiver associates a timer to each parent and exponentially backs off the timer after each failed experience [13].",
                "After the initial phase, each receiver maintains a fixed number of parents at any point of time (nopi(t)).",
                "Thus, a new parent should replace one of the active parents.",
                "However, to ensure monotonic improvement in overall performance of active parents, a new parent is always added before one of the existing parents is dropped (i.e., a receiver can temporarily have one extra parent).",
                "Given the available bandwidth from all parents (including the new one) and possible correlation among them, a receiver can use one of the following criteria to drop a parent: (i) to maximize the bandwidth, the receiver can drop the parent that contributes minimum bandwidth, (ii) to maximize path diversity among connections from parents, the receiver should drop the parent that is located behind the same bottleneck with the largest number of active parents and contributes minimum bandwidth among them.",
                "Finally, if the aggregate bandwidth from all parents remains below the required bandwidth after examining certain number of new parents (and nopi(t) < max nop), the receiver can increase the total number of parents by one. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we presented a simple receiver-driven framework for architecting peer-to-pee overlay structures called PRO.",
                "PRO allows each peer to selfishly and independently determine the best way to connect to the overlay to maximize its performance.",
                "Therefore, PRO should be able to maximize delivered quality to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth connectivity.",
                "Both peer discovery and peer selection in this framework are scalable.",
                "Furthermore, PRO uses congestion controlled bandwidth as an implicit signal to detect shared bottleneck among existing parents as well as changes in network or overlay conditions to properly reshape the structure.",
