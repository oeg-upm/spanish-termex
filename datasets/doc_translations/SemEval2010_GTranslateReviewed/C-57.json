In a CGLF, agents share a common set of resources, where each resource has a cost and a probability of failure. Each agent chooses a subset of the resources for the execution of his task, in order to maximize his own utility. The utility of an agent is the difference between his benefit from successful task completion and the sum of the costs over the resources he uses. CGLFs possess two novel features. It is the first model to incorporate failures into congestion settings, which results in a strict generalization of congestion games. In addition, it is the first model to consider load-dependent failures in such framework, where the failure probability of each resource depends on the number of agents selecting this resource. Although, as we show, CGLFs do not admit a potential function, and in general do not have a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, our main theorem proves the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium in every CGLF with identical resources and nondecreasing cost functions.

INTRODUCTION We study the effects of resource failures in congestion settings. This study is motivated by a variety of situations in multi-agent systems with unreliable components, such as machines, computers etc. We define a model for congestion games with load-dependent failures (CGLFs) which provides simple and natural description of such situations. In this model, we are given a finite set of identical resources (service providers) where each element possesses a failure probability describing the probability of unsuccessful completion of its assigned tasks as a (nondecreasing) function of its congestion. There is a fixed number of agents, each having a task which can be carried out by any of the resources. For reliability reasons, each agent may decide to assign his task, simultaneously, to a number of resources. Thus, the congestion on the resources is not known in advance, but is strategy-dependent. Each resource is associated with a cost, which is a (nonnegative) function of the congestion experienced by this resource. The objective of each agent is to maximize his own utility, which is the difference between his benefit from successful task completion and the sum of the costs over the set of resources he uses. The benefits of the agents from successful completion of their tasks are allowed to vary across the agents. The resource cost function describes the cost suffered by an agent for selecting that resource, as a function of the number of agents who have selected it. Thus, it is natural to assume that these functions are nonnegative. In addition, in many real-life applications of our model the resource cost functions have a special structure. In particular, they can monotonically increase or decrease with the number of the users, depending on the context. The former case is motivated by situations where high congestion on a resource causes longer delay in its assigned tasks execution and as a result, the cost of utilizing this resource might be higher. A typical example of such situation is as follows. Assume we need to deliver an important package. Since there is no guarantee that a courier will reach the destination in time, we might send several couriers to deliver the same package. The time required by each courier to deliver the package increases with the congestion on his way. In addition, the payment to a courier is proportional to the time he spends in delivering the package. Thus, the payment to the courier increases when the congestion increases. The latter case (decreasing cost functions) describes situations where a group of agents using a particular resource have an opportunity to share its cost among the groups members, or, the cost of 210 using a resource decreases with the number of users, according to some marketing policy. Our results We show that CGLFs and, in particular, CGLFs with nondecreasing cost functions, do not admit a potential function. Therefore, the CGLF model can not be reduced to congestion games. Nevertheless, if the failure probabilities are constant (do not depend on the congestion) then a potential function is guaranteed to exist. We show that CGLFs and, in particular, CGLFs with decreasing cost functions, do not possess pure strategy Nash equilibria. However, as we show in our main result, there exists a pure strategy Nash equilibrium in any CGLF with nondecreasing cost functions. Related work Our model extends the well-known class of congestion games [11]. In a congestion game, every agent has to choose from a finite set of resources, where the utility (or cost) of an agent from using a particular resource depends on the number of agents using it, and his total utility (cost) is the sum of the utilities (costs) obtained from the resources he uses. An important property of these games is the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria. Monderer and Shapley [9] introduced the notions of potential function and potential game and proved that the existence of a potential function implies the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. They observed that Rosenthal [11] proved his theorem on congestion games by constructing a potential function (hence, every congestion game is a potential game). Moreover, they showed that every finite potential game is isomorphic to a congestion game; hence, the classes of finite potential games and congestion games coincide. Congestion games have been extensively studied and generalized. In particular, Leyton-Brown and Tennenholtz [5] extended the class of congestion games to the class of localeffect games. In a local-effect game, each agents payoff is effected not only by the number of agents who have chosen the same resources as he has chosen, but also by the number of agents who have chosen neighboring resources (in a given graph structure). Monderer [8] dealt with another type of generalization of congestion games, in which the resource cost functions are player-specific (PS-congestion games). He defined PS-congestion games of type q (q-congestion games), where q is a positive number, and showed that every game in strategic form is a q-congestion game for some q. Playerspecific resource cost functions were discussed for the first time by Milchtaich [6]. He showed that simple and strategysymmetric PS-congestion games are not potential games, but always possess a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. PScongestion games were generalized to weighted congestion games [6] (or, ID-congestion games [7]), in which the resource cost functions are not only player-specific, but also depend on the identity of the users of the resource. Ackermann et al. [1] showed that weighted congestion games admit pure strategy Nash equilibria if the strategy space of each player consists of the bases of a matroid on the set of resources. Much of the work on congestion games has been inspired by the fact that every such game has a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. In particular, Fabrikant et al. [3] studied the computational complexity of finding pure strategy Nash equilibria in congestion games. Intensive study has also been devoted to quantify the inefficiency of equilibria in congestion games. Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [4] proposed the worst-case ratio of the social welfare achieved by a Nash equilibrium and by a socially optimal strategy profile (dubbed the price of anarchy) as a measure of the performance degradation caused by lack of coordination. Christodoulou and Koutsoupias [2] considered the price of anarchy of pure equilibria in congestion games with linear cost functions. Roughgarden and Tardos [12] used this approach to study the cost of selfish routing in networks with a continuum of users. However, the above settings do not take into consideration the possibility that resources may fail to execute their assigned tasks. In the computer science context of congestion games, where the alternatives of concern are machines, computers, communication lines etc., which are obviously prone to failures, this issue should not be ignored. Penn, Polukarov and Tennenholtz were the first to incorporate the issue of failures into congestion settings [10]. They introduced a class of congestion games with failures (CGFs) and proved that these games, while not being isomorphic to congestion games, always possess Nash equilibria in pure strategies. The CGF-model significantly differs from ours. In a CGF, the authors considered the delay associated with successful task completion, where the delay for an agent is the minimum of the delays of his successful attempts and the aim of each agent is to minimize his expected delay. In contrast with the CGF-model, in our model we consider the total cost of the utilized resources, where each agent wishes to maximize the difference between his benefit from a successful task completion and the sum of his costs over the resources he uses. The above differences imply that CGFs and CGLFs possess different properties. In particular, if in our model the resource failure probabilities were constant and known in advance, then a potential function would exist. This, however, does not hold for CGFs; in CGFs, the failure probabilities are constant but there is no potential function. Furthermore, the procedures proposed by the authors in [10] for the construction of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium are not valid in our model, even in the simple, agent-symmetric case, where all agents have the same benefit from successful completion of their tasks. Our work provides the first model of congestion settings with resource failures, which considers the sum of congestiondependent costs over utilized resources, and therefore, does not extend the CGF-model, but rather generalizes the classic model of congestion games. Moreover, it is the first model to consider load-dependent failures in the above context. 211 Organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we define our model. In Section 3 we present our results. In 3.1 we show that CGLFs, in general, do not have pure strategy Nash equilibria. In 3.2 we focus on CGLFs with nondecreasing cost functions (nondecreasing CGLFs). We show that these games do not admit a potential function. However, in our main result we show the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria in nondecreasing CGLFs. Section 4 is devoted to a short discussion. Many of the proofs are omitted from this conference version of the paper, and will appear in the full version. 2. THE MODEL The scenarios considered in this work consist of a finite set of agents where each agent has a task that can be carried out by any element of a set of identical resources (service providers). The agents simultaneously choose a subset of the resources in order to perform their tasks, and their aim is to maximize their own expected payoff, as described in the sequel. Let N be a set of n agents (n ∈ N), and let M be a set of m resources (m ∈ N). Agent i ∈ N chooses a strategy σi ∈ Σi which is a (potentially empty) subset of the resources. That is, Σi is the power set of the set of resources: Σi = P(M). Given a subset S ⊆ N of the agents, the set of strategy combinations of the members of S is denoted by ΣS = ×i∈SΣi, and the set of strategy combinations of the complement subset of agents is denoted by Σ−S (Σ−S = ΣN S = ×i∈N SΣi). The set of pure strategy profiles of all the agents is denoted by Σ (Σ = ΣN ). Each resource is associated with a cost, c(·), and a failure probability, f(·), each of which depends on the number of agents who use this resource. We assume that the failure probabilities of the resources are independent. Let σ = (σ1, . . . , σn) ∈ Σ be a pure strategy profile. The (m-dimensional) congestion vector that corresponds to σ is hσ = (hσ e )e∈M , where hσ e = ˛ ˛{i ∈ N : e ∈ σi} ˛ ˛. The failure probability of a resource e is a monotone nondecreasing function f : {1, . . . , n} → [0, 1) of the congestion experienced by e. The cost of utilizing resource e is a function c : {1, . . . , n} → R+ of the congestion experienced by e. The outcome for agent i ∈ N is denoted by xi ∈ {S, F}, where S and F, respectively, indicate whether the task execution succeeded or failed. We say that the execution of agents i task succeeds if the task of agent i is successfully completed by at least one of the resources chosen by him. The benefit of agent i from his outcome xi is denoted by Vi(xi), where Vi(S) = vi, a given (nonnegative) value, and Vi(F) = 0. The utility of agent i from strategy profile σ and his outcome xi, ui(σ, xi), is the difference between his benefit from the outcome (Vi(xi)) and the sum of the costs of the resources he has used: ui(σ, xi) = Vi(xi) − X e∈σi c(hσ e ) . The expected utility of agent i from strategy profile σ, Ui(σ), is, therefore: Ui(σ) = 1 − Y e∈σi f(hσ e ) ! vi − X e∈σi c(hσ e ) , where 1 − Q e∈σi f(hσ e ) denotes the probability of successful completion of agent is task. We use the convention thatQ e∈∅ f(hσ e ) = 1. Hence, if agent i chooses an empty set σi = ∅ (does not assign his task to any resource), then his expected utility, Ui(∅, σ−i), equals zero. 3. PURE STRATEGY NASH EQUILIBRIA IN CGLFS In this section we present our results on CGLFs. We investigate the property of the (non-)existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria in these games. We show that this class of games does not, in general, possess pure strategy equilibria. Nevertheless, if the resource cost functions are nondecreasing then such equilibria are guaranteed to exist, despite the non-existence of a potential function. 3.1 Decreasing Cost Functions We start by showing that the class of CGLFs and, in particular, the subclass of CGLFs with decreasing cost functions, does not, in general, possess Nash equilibria in pure strategies. Consider a CGLF with two agents (N = {1, 2}) and two resources (M = {e1, e2}). The cost function of each resource is given by c(x) = 1 xx , where x ∈ {1, 2}, and the failure probabilities are f(1) = 0.01 and f(2) = 0.26. The benefits of the agents from successful task completion are v1 = 1.1 and v2 = 4. Below we present the payoff matrix of the game. ∅ {e1} {e2} {e1, e2} ∅ U1 = 0 U1 = 0 U1 = 0 U1 = 0 U2 = 0 U2 = 2.96 U2 = 2.96 U2 = 1.9996 {e1} U1 = 0.089 U1 = 0.564 U1 = 0.089 U1 = 0.564 U2 = 0 U2 = 2.71 U2 = 2.96 U2 = 2.7396 {e2} U1 = 0.089 U1 = 0.089 U1 = 0.564 U1 = 0.564 U2 = 0 U2 = 2.96 U2 = 2.71 U2 = 2.7396 {e1, e2} U1 = −0.90011 U1 = −0.15286 U1 = −0.15286 U1 = 0.52564 U2 = 0 U2 = 2.71 U2 = 2.71 U2 = 3.2296 Table 1: Example for non-existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria in CGLFs. It can be easily seen that for every pure strategy profile σ in this game there exist an agent i and a strategy σi ∈ Σi such that Ui(σ−i, σi) > Ui(σ). That is, every pure strategy profile in this game is not in equilibrium. However, if the cost functions in a given CGLF do not decrease in the number of users, then, as we show in the main result of this paper, a pure strategy Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist. 212 3.2 Nondecreasing Cost Functions This section focuses on the subclass of CGLFs with nondecreasing cost functions (henceforth, nondecreasing CGLFs). We show that nondecreasing CGLFs do not, in general, admit a potential function. Therefore, these games are not congestion games. Nevertheless, we prove that all such games possess pure strategy Nash equilibria. 3.2.1 The (Non-)Existence of a Potential Function Recall that Monderer and Shapley [9] introduced the notions of potential function and potential game, where potential game is defined to be a game that possesses a potential function. A potential function is a real-valued function over the set of pure strategy profiles, with the property that the gain (or loss) of an agent shifting to another strategy while the other agents strategies are kept unchanged, equals to the corresponding increment of the potential function. The authors [9] showed that the classes of finite potential games and congestion games coincide. Here we show that the class of CGLFs and, in particular, the subclass of nondecreasing CGLFs, does not admit a potential function, and therefore is not included in the class of congestion games. However, for the special case of constant failure probabilities, a potential function is guaranteed to exist. To prove these statements we use the following characterization of potential games [9]. A path in Σ is a sequence τ = (σ0 → σ1 → · · · ) such that for every k ≥ 1 there exists a unique agent, say agent i, such that σk = (σk−1 −i , σi) for some σi = σk−1 i in Σi. A finite path τ = (σ0 → σ1 → · · · → σK ) is closed if σ0 = σK . It is a simple closed path if in addition σl = σk for every 0 ≤ l = k ≤ K − 1. The length of a simple closed path is defined to be the number of distinct points in it; that is, the length of τ = (σ0 → σ1 → · · · → σK ) is K. Theorem 1. [9] Let G be a game in strategic form with a vector U = (U1, . . . , Un) of utility functions. For a finite path τ = (σ0 → σ1 → · · · → σK ), let U(τ) = PK k=1[Uik (σk )− Uik (σk−1 )], where ik is the unique deviator at step k. Then, G is a potential game if and only if U(τ) = 0 for every simple closed path τ of length 4. Load-Dependent Failures Based on Theorem 1, we present the following counterexample that demonstrates the non-existence of a potential function in CGLFs. We consider the following agent-symmetric game G in which two agents (N = {1, 2}) wish to assign a task to two resources (M = {e1, e2}). The benefit from a successful task completion of each agent equals v, and the failure probability function strictly increases with the congestion. Consider the simple closed path of length 4 which is formed by α = (∅, {e2}) , β = ({e1}, {e2}) , γ = ({e1}, {e1, e2}) , δ = (∅, {e1, e2}) : {e2} {e1, e2} ∅ U1 = 0 U1 = 0 U2 = (1 − f(1)) v − c(1) U2 = ` 1 − f(1)2 ´ v − 2c(1) {e1} U1 = (1 − f(1)) v − c(1) U1 = (1 − f(2)) v − c(2) U2 = (1 − f(1)) v − c(1) U2 = (1 − f(1)f(2)) v − c(1) − c(2) Table 2: Example for non-existence of potentials in CGLFs. Therefore, U1(α) − U1(β) + U2(β) − U2(γ) + U1(γ) − U1(δ) +U2(δ) − U2(α) = v (1 − f(1)) (f(1) − f(2)) = 0. Thus, by Theorem 1, nondecreasing CGLFs do not admit potentials. As a result, they are not congestion games. However, as presented in the next section, the special case in which the failure probabilities are constant, always possesses a potential function. Constant Failure Probabilities We show below that CGLFs with constant failure probabilities always possess a potential function. This follows from the fact that the expected benefit (revenue) of each agent in this case does not depend on the choices of the other agents. In addition, for each agent, the sum of the costs over his chosen subset of resources, equals the payoff of an agent choosing the same strategy in the corresponding congestion game. Assume we are given a game G with constant failure probabilities. Let τ = (α → β → γ → δ → α) be an arbitrary simple closed path of length 4. Let i and j denote the active agents (deviators) in τ and z ∈ Σ−{i,j} be a fixed strategy profile of the other agents. Let α = (xi, xj, z), β = (yi, xj, z), γ = (yi, yj, z), δ = (xi, yj, z), where xi, yi ∈ Σi and xj, yj ∈ Σj. Then, U(τ) = Ui(xi, xj, z) − Ui(yi, xj, z) +Uj(yi, xj, z) − Uj(yi, yj, z) +Ui(yi, yj, z) − Ui(xi, yj, z) +Uj(xi, yj, z) − Uj(xi, xj, z) = 1 − f|xi| vi − X e∈xi c(h (xi,xj ,z) e ) − . . . − 1 − f|xj | vj + X e∈xj c(h (xi,xj ,z) e ) = » 1 − f|xi| vi − . . . − 1 − f|xj | vj − » X e∈xi c(h (xi,xj ,z) e ) − . . . − X e∈xj c(h (xi,xj ,z) e ) . Notice that » 1 − f|xi| vi − . . . − 1 − f|xj | vj = 0, as a sum of a telescope series. The remaining sum equals 0, by applying Theorem 1 to congestion games, which are known to possess a potential function. Thus, by Theorem 1, G is a potential game. 213 We note that the above result holds also for the more general settings with non-identical resources (having different failure probabilities and cost functions) and general cost functions (not necessarily monotone and/or nonnegative). 3.2.2 The Existence of a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium In the previous section, we have shown that CGLFs and, in particular, nondecreasing CGLFs, do not admit a potential function, but this fact, in general, does not contradict the existence of an equilibrium in pure strategies. In this section, we present and prove the main result of this paper (Theorem 2) which shows the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria in nondecreasing CGLFs. Theorem 2. Every nondecreasing CGLF possesses a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. The proof of Theorem 2 is based on Lemmas 4, 7 and 8, which are presented in the sequel. We start with some definitions and observations that are needed for their proofs. In particular, we present the notions of A-, D- and S-stability and show that a strategy profile is in equilibrium if and only if it is A-, D- and S- stable. Furthermore, we prove the existence of such a profile in any given nondecreasing CGLF. Definition 3. For any strategy profile σ ∈ Σ and for any agent i ∈ N, the operation of adding precisely one resource to his strategy, σi, is called an A-move of i from σ. Similarly, the operation of dropping a single resource is called a D-move, and the operation of switching one resource with another is called an S-move. Clearly, if agent i deviates from strategy σi to strategy σi by applying a single A-, D- or S-move, then max {|σi σi|, |σi σi|} = 1, and vice versa, if max {|σi σi|, |σi σi|} = 1 then σi is obtained from σi by applying exactly one such move. For simplicity of exposition, for any pair of sets A and B, let µ(A, B) = max {|A B|, |B A|}. The following lemma implies that any strategy profile, in which no agent wishes unilaterally to apply a single A-, Dor S-move, is a Nash equilibrium. More precisely, we show that if there exists an agent who benefits from a unilateral deviation from a given strategy profile, then there exists a single A-, D- or S-move which is profitable for him as well. Lemma 4. Given a nondecreasing CGLF, let σ ∈ Σ be a strategy profile which is not in equilibrium, and let i ∈ N such that ∃xi ∈ Σi for which Ui(σ−i, xi) > Ui(σ). Then, there exists yi ∈ Σi such that Ui(σ−i, yi) > Ui(σ) and µ(yi, σi) = 1. Therefore, to prove the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, it suffices to look for a strategy profile for which no agent wishes to unilaterally apply an A-, D- or S-move. Based on the above observation, we define A-, D- and Sstability as follows. Definition 5. A strategy profile σ is said to be A-stable (resp., D-stable, S-stable) if there are no agents with a profitable A- (resp., D-, S-) move from σ. Similarly, we define a strategy profile σ to be DS-stable if there are no agents with a profitable D- or S-move from σ. The set of all DS-stable strategy profiles is denoted by Σ0 . Obviously, the profile (∅, . . . , ∅) is DS-stable, so Σ0 is not empty. Our goal is to find a DS-stable profile for which no profitable A-move exists, implying this profile is in equilibrium. To describe how we achieve this, we define the notions of light (heavy) resources and (nearly-) even strategy profiles, which play a central role in the proof of our main result. Definition 6. Given a strategy profile σ, resource e is called σ-light if hσ e ∈ arg mine∈M hσ e and σ-heavy otherwise. A strategy profile σ with no heavy resources will be termed even. A strategy profile σ satisfying |hσ e − hσ e | ≤ 1 for all e, e ∈ M will be termed nearly-even. Obviously, every even strategy profile is nearly-even. In addition, in a nearly-even strategy profile, all heavy resources (if exist) have the same congestion. We also observe that the profile (∅, . . . , ∅) is even (and DS-stable), so the subset of even, DS-stable strategy profiles is not empty. Based on the above observations, we define two types of an A-move that are used in the sequel. Suppose σ ∈ Σ0 is a nearly-even DS-stable strategy profile. For each agent i ∈ N, let ei ∈ arg mine∈M σi hσ e . That is, ei is a lightest resource not chosen previously by i. Then, if there exists any profitable A-move for agent i, then the A-move with ei is profitable for i as well. This is since if agent i wishes to unilaterally add a resource, say a ∈ M σi, then Ui (σ−i, (σi ∪ {a})) > Ui(σ). Hence, 1 − Y e∈σi f(hσ e )f(hσ a + 1) ! vi − X e∈σi c(hσ e ) − c(hσ a + 1) > 1 − Y e∈σi f(hσ e ) ! vi − X e∈σi c(hσ e ) ⇒ vi Y e∈σi f(hσ e ) > c(hσ a + 1) 1 − f(hσ a + 1) ≥ c(hσ ei + 1) 1 − f(hσ ei + 1) ⇒ Ui (σ−i, (σi ∪ {ei})) > Ui(σ) . If no agent wishes to change his strategy in this manner, i.e. Ui(σ) ≥ Ui(σ−i, σi ∪{ei}) for all i ∈ N, then by the above Ui(σ) ≥ Ui(σ−i, σi ∪{a}) for all i ∈ N and a ∈ M σi. Hence, σ is A-stable and by Lemma 4, σ is a Nash equilibrium strategy profile. Otherwise, let N(σ) denote the subset of all agents for which there exists ei such that a unilateral addition of ei is profitable. Let a ∈ arg minei : i∈N(σ) hσ ei . Let also i ∈ N(σ) be the agent for which ei = a. If a is σ-light, then let σ = (σ−i, σi ∪ {a}). In this case we say that σ is obtained from σ by a one-step addition of resource a, and a is called an added resource. If a is σ-heavy then there exists a σ-light resource b and an agent j such that a ∈ σj and b /∈ σj. Then let σ = ` σ−{i,j}, σi ∪ {a}, (σj {a}) ∪ {b} ´ . In this case we say that σ is obtained from σ by a two-step addition of resource b, and b is called an added resource. We notice that, in both cases, the congestion of each resource in σ is the same as in σ, except for the added resource, for which its congestion in σ increased by 1. Thus, since the added resource is σ-light and σ is nearly-even, σ is nearly-even. Then, the following lemma implies the Sstability of σ . 214 Lemma 7. In a nondecreasing CGLF, every nearly-even strategy profile is S-stable. Coupled with Lemma 7, the following lemma shows that if σ is a nearly-even and DS-stable strategy profile, and σ is obtained from σ by a one- or two-step addition of resource a, then the only potential cause for a non-DS-stability of σ is the existence of an agent k ∈ N with σk = σk, who wishes to drop the added resource a. Lemma 8. Let σ be a nearly-even DS-stable strategy profile of a given nondecreasing CGLF, and let σ be obtained from σ by a one- or two-step addition of resource a. Then, there are no profitable D-moves for any agent i ∈ N with σi = σi. For an agent i ∈ N with σi = σi, the only possible profitable D-move (if exists) is to drop the added resource a. We are now ready to prove our main result - Theorem 2. Let us briefly describe the idea behind the proof. By Lemma 4, it suffices to prove the existence of a strategy profile which is A-, D- and S-stable. We start with the set of even and DS-stable strategy profiles which is obviously not empty. In this set, we consider the subset of strategy profiles with maximum congestion and maximum sum of the agents utilities. Assuming on the contrary that every DSstable profile admits a profitable A-move, we show the existence of a strategy profile x in the above subset, such that a (one-step) addition of some resource a to x results in a DSstable strategy. Then by a finite series of one- or two-step addition operations we obtain an even, DS-stable strategy profile with strictly higher congestion on the resources, contradicting the choice of x. The full proof is presented below. Proof of Theorem 2: Let Σ1 ⊆ Σ0 be the subset of all even, DS-stable strategy profiles. Observe that since (∅, . . . , ∅) is an even, DS-stable strategy profile, then Σ1 is not empty, and minσ∈Σ0 ˛ ˛{e ∈ M : e is σ−heavy} ˛ ˛ = 0. Then, Σ1 could also be defined as Σ1 = arg min σ∈Σ0 ˛ ˛{e ∈ M : e is σ−heavy} ˛ ˛ , with hσ being the common congestion. Now, let Σ2 ⊆ Σ1 be the subset of Σ1 consisting of all those profiles with maximum congestion on the resources. That is, Σ2 = arg max σ∈Σ1 hσ . Let UN (σ) = P i∈N Ui(σ) denotes the group utility of the agents, and let Σ3 ⊆ Σ2 be the subset of all profiles in Σ2 with maximum group utility. That is, Σ3 = arg max σ∈Σ2 X i∈N Ui(σ) = arg max σ∈Σ2 UN (σ) . Consider first the simple case in which maxσ∈Σ1 hσ = 0. Obviously, in this case, Σ1 = Σ2 = Σ3 = {x = (∅, . . . , ∅)}. We show below that by performing a finite series of (onestep) addition operations on x, we obtain an even, DSstable strategy profile y with higher congestion, that is with hy > hx = 0, in contradiction to x ∈ Σ2 . Let z ∈ Σ0 be a nearly-even (not necessarily even) DS-stable profile such that mine∈M hz e = 0, and note that the profile x satisfies the above conditions. Let N(z) be the subset of agents for which a profitable A-move exists, and let i ∈ N(z). Obviously, there exists a z-light resource a such that Ui(z−i, zi ∪ {a}) > Ui(z) (otherwise, arg mine∈M hz e ⊆ zi, in contradiction to mine∈M hz e = 0). Consider the strategy profile z = (z−i, zi ∪ {a}) which is obtained from z by a (one-step) addition of resource a by agent i. Since z is nearly-even and a is z-light, we can easily see that z is nearly-even. Then, Lemma 7 implies that z is S-stable. Since i is the only agent using resource a in z , by Lemma 8, no profitable D-moves are available. Thus, z is a DS-stable strategy profile. Therefore, since the number of resources is finite, there is a finite series of one-step addition operations on x = (∅, . . . , ∅) that leads to strategy profile y ∈ Σ1 with hy = 1 > 0 = hx , in contradiction to x ∈ Σ2 . We turn now to consider the other case where maxσ∈Σ1 hσ ≥ 1. In this case we select from Σ3 a strategy profile x, as described below, and use it to contradict our contrary assumption. Specifically, we show that there exists x ∈ Σ3 such that for all j ∈ N, vjf(hx )|xj |−1 ≥ c(hx + 1) 1 − f(hx + 1) . (1) Let x be a strategy profile which is obtained from x by a (one-step) addition of some resource a ∈ M by some agent i ∈ N(x) (note that x is nearly-even). Then, (1) is derived from and essentially equivalent to the inequality Uj(x ) ≥ Uj(x−j, xj {a}), for all a ∈ xj. That is, after performing an A-move with a by i, there is no profitable D-move with a. Then, by Lemmas 7 and 8, x is DS-stable. Following the same lines as above, we construct a procedure that initializes at x and achieves a strategy profile y ∈ Σ1 with hy > hx , in contradiction to x ∈ Σ2 . Now, let us confirm the existence of x ∈ Σ3 that satisfies (1). Let x ∈ Σ3 and let M(x) be the subset of all resources for which there exists a profitable (one-step) addition. First, we show that (1) holds for all j ∈ N such that xj ∩M(x) = ∅, that is, for all those agents with one of their resources being desired by another agent. Let a ∈ M(x), and let x be the strategy profile that is obtained from x by the (one-step) addition of a by agent i. Assume on the contrary that there is an agent j with a ∈ xj such that vjf(hx )|xj |−1 < c(hx + 1) 1 − f(hx + 1) . Let x = (x−j, xj {a}). Below we demonstrate that x is a DS-stable strategy profile and, since x and x correspond to the same congestion vector, we conclude that x lies in Σ2 . In addition, we show that UN (x ) > UN (x), contradicting the fact that x ∈ Σ3 . To show that x ∈ Σ0 we note that x is an even strategy profile, and thus no S-moves may be performed for x . In addition, since hx = hx and x ∈ Σ0 , there are no profitable D-moves for any agent k = i, j. It remains to show that there are no profitable D-moves for agents i and j as well. 215 Since Ui(x ) > Ui(x), we get vif(hx )|xi| > c(hx + 1) 1 − f(hx + 1) ⇒ vif(hx )|xi |−1 = vif(hx )|xi| > c(hx + 1) 1 − f(hx + 1) > c(hx ) 1 − f(hx) = c(hx ) 1 − f(hx ) , which implies Ui(x ) > Ui(x−i, xi {b}), for all b ∈ xi . Thus, there are no profitable D-moves for agent i. By the DS-stability of x, for agent j and for all b ∈ xj, we have Uj(x) ≥ Uj(x−j, xj {b}) ⇒ vjf(hx )|xj |−1 ≥ c(hx ) 1 − f(hx) . Then, vjf(hx )|xj |−1 > vjf(hx )|xj | = vjf(hx )|xj |−1 ≥ c(hx ) 1 − f(hx) = c(hx ) 1 − f(hx ) ⇒ Uj(x ) > Uj(x−j, xj {b}), for all b ∈ xi. Therefore, x is DS-stable and lies in Σ2 . To show that UN (x ), the group utility of x , satisfies UN (x ) > UN (x), we note that hx = hx , and thus Uk(x ) = Uk(x), for all k ∈ N {i, j}. Therefore, we have to show that Ui(x ) + Uj(x ) > Ui(x) + Uj(x), or Ui(x ) − Ui(x) > Uj(x) − Uj(x ). Observe that Ui(x ) > Ui(x) ⇒ vif(hx )|xi| > c(hx + 1) 1 − f(hx + 1) and Uj(x ) < Uj(x ) ⇒ vjf(hx )|xj |−1 < c(hx + 1) 1 − f(hx + 1) , which yields vif(hx )|xi| > vjf(hx )|xj |−1 . Thus, Ui(x ) − Ui(x) = 1 − f(hx )|xi|+1 vi − (|xi| + 1) c(hx ) − h 1 − f(hx )|xi| vi − |xi|c(hx ) i = vif(hx )|xi| (1 − f(hx )) − c(hx ) > vjf(hx )|xj |−1 (1 − f(hx )) − c(hx ) = 1 − f(hx )|xj | vj − |xj|c(hx ) − h 1 − f(hx )|xj |−1 vj − (|xi| − 1) c(hx ) i = Uj(x) − Uj(x ) . Therefore, x lies in Σ2 and satisfies UN (x ) > UN (x), in contradiction to x ∈ Σ3 . Hence, if x ∈ Σ3 then (1) holds for all j ∈ N such that xj ∩M(x) = ∅. Now let us see that there exists x ∈ Σ3 such that (1) holds for all the agents. For that, choose an agent i ∈ arg mink∈N vif(hx )|xk| . If there exists a ∈ xi ∩ M(x) then i satisfies (1), implying by the choice of agent i, that the above obviously yields the correctness of (1) for any agent k ∈ N. Otherwise, if no resource in xi lies in M(x), then let a ∈ xi and a ∈ M(x). Since a ∈ xi, a /∈ xi, and hx a = hx a , then there exists agent j such that a ∈ xj and a /∈ xj. One can easily check that the strategy profile x = ` x−{i,j}, (xi {a}) ∪ {a }, (xj {a }) ∪ {a} ´ lies in Σ3 . Thus, x satisfies (1) for agent i, and therefore, for any agent k ∈ N. Now, let x ∈ Σ3 satisfy (1). We show below that by performing a finite series of one- and two-step addition operations on x, we can achieve a strategy profile y that lies in Σ1 , such that hy > hx , in contradiction to x ∈ Σ2 . Let z ∈ Σ0 be a nearly-even (not necessarily even), DS-stable strategy profile, such that vi Y e∈zi {b} f(hz e) ≥ c(hz b + 1) 1 − f(hz b + 1) , (2) for all i ∈ N and for all z-light resource b ∈ zi. We note that for profile x ∈ Σ3 ⊆ Σ1 , with all resources being x-light, conditions (2) and (1) are equivalent. Let z be obtained from z by a one- or two-step addition of a z-light resource a. Obviously, z is nearly-even. In addition, hz e ≥ hz e for all e ∈ M, and mine∈M hz e ≥ mine∈M hz e. To complete the proof we need to show that z is DS-stable, and, in addition, that if mine∈M hz e = mine∈M hz e then z has property (2). The DS-stability of z follows directly from Lemmas 7 and 8, and from (2) with respect to z. It remains to prove property (2) for z with mine∈M hz e = mine∈M hz e. Using (2) with respect to z, for any agent k with zk = zk and for any zlight resource b ∈ zk, we get vk Y e∈zk {b} f(hz e ) ≥ vk Y e∈zk {b} f(hz e) ≥ c(hz b + 1) 1 − f(hz b + 1) = c(hz b + 1) 1 − f(hz b + 1) , as required. Now let us consider the rest of the agents. Assume z is obtained by the one-step addition of a by agent i. In this case, i is the only agent with zi = zi. The required property for agent i follows directly from Ui(z ) > Ui(z). In the case of a two-step addition, let z = ` z−{i,j}, zi ∪ {b}, (zj {b}) ∪ {a}), where b is a z-heavy resource. For agent i, from Ui(z−i, zi ∪ {b}) > Ui(z) we get 1 − Y e∈zi f(hz e)f(hz b + 1) ! vi − X e∈zi c(hz e) − c(hz b + 1) > 1 − Y e∈zi f(hz e) ! vi − X e∈zi c(hz e) ⇒ vi Y e∈zi f(hz e) > c(hz b + 1) 1 − f(hz b + 1) , (3) and note that since hz b ≥ hz e for all e ∈ M and, in particular, for all z -light resources, then c(hz b + 1) 1 − f(hz b + 1) ≥ c(hz e + 1) 1 − f(hz e + 1) , (4) for any z -light resource e . 216 Now, since hz e ≥ hz e for all e ∈ M and b is z-heavy, then vi Y e∈zi {e } f(hz e ) ≥ vi Y e∈zi {e } f(hz e) = vi Y e∈(zi∪{b}) {e } f(hz e) ≥ vi Y e∈zi f(hz e) , for any z -light resource e . The above, coupled with (3) and (4), yields the required. For agent j we just use (2) with respect to z and the equality hz b = hz a . For any z -light resource e , vj Y e∈zj {e } f(hz e ) ≥ vi Y e∈zi {e } f(hz e) ≥ c(hz e + 1) 1 − f(hz e + 1) = c(hz e + 1) 1 − f(hz e + 1) . Thus, since the number of resources is finite, there is a finite series of one- and two-step addition operations on x that leads to strategy profile y ∈ Σ1 with hy > hx , in contradiction to x ∈ Σ2 . This completes the proof. 4. DISCUSSION In this paper, we introduce and investigate congestion settings with unreliable resources, in which the probability of a resources failure depends on the congestion experienced by this resource. We defined a class of congestion games with load-dependent failures (CGLFs), which generalizes the wellknown class of congestion games. We study the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria and potential functions in the presented class of games. We show that these games do not, in general, possess pure strategy equilibria. Nevertheless, if the resource cost functions are nondecreasing then such equilibria are guaranteed to exist, despite the non-existence of a potential function. The CGLF-model can be modified to the case where the agents pay only for non-faulty resources they selected. Both the model discussed in this paper and the modified one are reasonable. In the full version we will show that the modified model leads to similar results. In particular, we can show the existence of a pure strategy equilibrium for nondecreasing CGLFs also in the modified model. In future research we plan to consider various extensions of CGLFs. In particular, we plan to consider CGLFs where the resources may have different costs and failure probabilities, as well as CGLFs in which the resource failure probabilities are mutually dependent. In addition, it is of interest to develop an efficient algorithm for the computation of pure strategy Nash equilibrium, as well as discuss the social (in)efficiency of the equilibria. 5.

En un CGLF, los agentes comparten un conjunto común de recursos, donde cada recurso tiene un costo y una probabilidad de falla. Cada agente elige un subconjunto de los recursos para la ejecución de su tarea, para maximizar su propia utilidad. La utilidad de un agente es la diferencia entre su beneficio de la finalización exitosa de la tarea y la suma de los costos sobre los recursos que utiliza. CGLFS posee dos características novedosas. Es el primer modelo que incorpora fallas en la configuración de congestión, lo que resulta en una estricta generalización de los juegos de congestión. Además, es el primer modelo que considera fallas dependientes de la carga en dicho marco, donde la probabilidad de falla de cada recurso depende del número de agentes que seleccionan este recurso. Aunque, como mostramos, los CGLF no admiten una función potencial, y en general no tienen una estrategia pura equilibrio Nash, nuestro teorema principal demuestra la existencia de una estrategia pura NASH Equilibrio en cada CGLF con recursos idénticos y funciones de costo no aconsejables.

Introducción Estudiamos los efectos de las fallas de recursos en entornos de congestión. Este estudio está motivado por una variedad de situaciones en sistemas de múltiples agentes con componentes poco confiables, como máquinas, computadoras, etc. Definimos un modelo para juegos de congestión con fallas dependientes de la carga (CGLF) que proporciona una descripción simple y natural de tales situaciones. En este modelo, se nos da un conjunto finito de recursos idénticos (proveedores de servicios) donde cada elemento posee una probabilidad de falla que describe la probabilidad de completar fallidas de sus tareas asignadas como una función (no acelerante) de su congestión. Hay un número fijo de agentes, cada uno con una tarea que puede ser realizada por cualquiera de los recursos. Por razones de confiabilidad, cada agente puede decidir asignar su tarea, simultáneamente, a una serie de recursos. Por lo tanto, la congestión de los recursos no se conoce de antemano, pero depende de la estrategia. Cada recurso está asociado con un costo, que es una función (no negativa) de la congestión experimentada por este recurso. El objetivo de cada agente es maximizar su propia utilidad, que es la diferencia entre su beneficio de la finalización exitosa de la tarea y la suma de los costos sobre el conjunto de recursos que utiliza. Los beneficios de los agentes de la finalización exitosa de sus tareas pueden variar entre los agentes. La función de costo de recursos describe el costo sufrido por un agente para seleccionar ese recurso, en función del número de agentes que lo han seleccionado. Por lo tanto, es natural suponer que estas funciones no son negativas. Además, en muchas aplicaciones de la vida real de nuestro modelo, las funciones de costos de recursos tienen una estructura especial. En particular, pueden aumentar o disminuir monotónicamente con el número de usuarios, dependiendo del contexto. El primer caso está motivado por situaciones en las que la alta congestión en un recurso causa un retraso más largo en su ejecución de tareas asignadas y, como resultado, el costo de utilizar este recurso podría ser mayor. Un ejemplo típico de tal situación es el siguiente. Suponga que necesitamos entregar un paquete importante. Dado que no hay garantía de que un servicio de mensajería llegue al destino a tiempo, podríamos enviar varios correos para entregar el mismo paquete. El tiempo requerido por cada mensajero para entregar el paquete aumenta con la congestión en su camino. Además, el pago a un mensajero es proporcional al tiempo que pasa en entrega del paquete. Por lo tanto, el pago al mensajero aumenta cuando aumenta la congestión. El último caso (funciones de costo decrecientes) describe situaciones en las que un grupo de agentes que usan un recurso en particular tienen la oportunidad de compartir su costo entre los miembros de los grupos, o el costo de 210 que usa un recurso disminuye con el número de usuarios, según algunosPolítica de marketing. Nuestros resultados mostramos que los CGLF y, en particular, los CGLF con funciones de costos no acumulables no admiten una función potencial. Por lo tanto, el modelo CGLF no se puede reducir a juegos de congestión. Sin embargo, si las probabilidades de falla son constantes (no dependen de la congestión), se garantiza que existirá una función potencial. Mostramos que los CGLF y, en particular, los CGLF con funciones de costo decrecientes no poseen equilibrios de Nash de estrategia pura. Sin embargo, como mostramos en nuestro resultado principal, existe una estrategia pura Nash Equilibrium en cualquier CGLF con funciones de costo no acelerantes. Trabajo relacionado Nuestro modelo extiende la conocida clase de juegos de congestión [11]. En un juego de congestión, cada agente debe elegir entre un conjunto finito de recursos, donde la utilidad (o costo) de un agente de usar un recurso particular depende de la cantidad de agentes que lo usan, y su utilidad total (costo) es elSuma de los servicios públicos (costos) obtenidos de los recursos que utiliza. Una propiedad importante de estos juegos es la existencia de pura estrategia Nash Equilibrios. Monderer y Shapley [9] introdujeron las nociones de la función potencial y el juego potencial y demostraron que la existencia de una función potencial implica la existencia de una estrategia pura equilibrio Nash. Observaron que Rosenthal [11] demostró su teorema en los juegos de congestión al construir una función potencial (por lo tanto, cada juego de congestión es un juego potencial). Además, demostraron que cada juego de potencial finito es isomórfico para un juego de congestión;Por lo tanto, las clases de juegos potenciales finitos y juegos de congestión coinciden. Los juegos de congestión han sido ampliamente estudiados y generalizados. En particular, Leyton-Brown y Tennenholtz [5] extendieron la clase de juegos de congestión a la clase de Juegos de Señora. En un juego de efectos locales, cada recompensa de los agentes se ve afectado no solo por el número de agentes que han elegido los mismos recursos que ha elegido, sino también por el número de agentes que han elegido recursos vecinos (en una estructura gráfica dada). Monderer [8] se ocupó de otro tipo de generalización de los juegos de congestión, en el que las funciones de costo de recursos son específicas del jugador (juegos PS-Conestion). Definió los juegos de PS-Condion de Tipo Q (juegos Q-Conestión), donde Q es un número positivo, y demostró que cada juego en forma estratégica es un juego Q-Coneste de Q para algunos Q.Milchtaich [6] discutieron las funciones de costo de recursos específicos de los jugadores por primera vez [6]. Mostró que los juegos simples y de estrategia simétricos de PS-Coneste de PS no son juegos potenciales, pero siempre poseen una estrategia pura Nash Equilibrium. Los juegos de PSCongStion se generalizaron a los juegos de congestión ponderados [6] (o juegos de identificación de identificación [7]), en los que las funciones de costo de recursos no solo son específicas de los jugadores, sino que también dependen de la identidad de los usuarios del recurso. Ackermann et al.[1] mostró que los juegos de congestión ponderados admiten la estrategia pura Nash Equilibrios si el espacio de estrategia de cada jugador consiste en las bases de un matroid en el conjunto de recursos. Gran parte del trabajo en juegos de congestión se ha inspirado en el hecho de que cada juego tiene una estrategia pura Nash Equilibrium. En particular, Fabrikant et al.[3] estudió la complejidad computacional de encontrar la estrategia pura Nash Equilibrios en los juegos de congestión. El estudio intensivo también se ha dedicado a cuantificar la ineficiencia de los equilibrios en los juegos de congestión. Koutsoupias y Papadimitriou [4] propusieron la peor relación de caso del bienestar social logrado por un equilibrio de Nash y por un perfil de estrategia socialmente óptimo (denominado precio de la anarquía) como una medida de la degradación del rendimiento causada por la falta de coordinación. Christodoulou y Koutsoupias [2] consideraron el precio de la anarquía de los equilibrios puros en los juegos de congestión con funciones de costo lineal. Roughgarden y Tardos [12] utilizaron este enfoque para estudiar el costo del enrutamiento egoísta en las redes con un continuo de usuarios. Sin embargo, la configuración anterior no tiene en cuenta la posibilidad de que los recursos no puedan ejecutar sus tareas asignadas. En el contexto de la informática de los juegos de congestión, donde las alternativas de preocupación son máquinas, computadoras, líneas de comunicación, etc., que obviamente son propensas a las fallas, este problema no debe ignorarse. Penn, Polukarov y Tennenholtz fueron los primeros en incorporar el problema de las fallas en la configuración de congestión [10]. Introdujeron una clase de juegos de congestión con fallas (CGF) y demostraron que estos juegos, aunque no son isomórficos para los juegos de congestión, siempre poseen equilibrios de Nash en estrategias puras. El modelo CGF difiere significativamente de el nuestro. En un CGF, los autores consideraron el retraso asociado con la finalización exitosa de la tarea, donde la demora para un agente es el mínimo de los retrasos de sus intentos exitosos y el objetivo de cada agente es minimizar su retraso esperado. En contraste con el modelo CGF, en nuestro modelo consideramos el costo total de los recursos utilizados, donde cada agente desea maximizar la diferencia entre su beneficio de una finalización exitosa de tareas y la suma de sus costos sobre los recursos que usa. Las diferencias anteriores implican que los CGF y los CGLF poseen diferentes propiedades. En particular, si en nuestro modelo las probabilidades de falla del recurso fueran constantes y conocidas de antemano, entonces existiría una función potencial. Esto, sin embargo, no se mantiene para CGFS;En CGFS, las probabilidades de falla son constantes, pero no hay una función potencial. Además, los procedimientos propuestos por los autores en [10] para la construcción de una estrategia pura El equilibrio Nash no son válidos en nuestro modelo, incluso en el caso simple y simétrico del agente, donde todos los agentes tienen el mismo beneficio de la finalización exitosa de sutareas. Nuestro trabajo proporciona el primer modelo de configuración de congestión con fallas de recursos, que considera la suma de los costos dependientes de la congestión sobre los recursos utilizados y, por lo tanto, no extiende el modelo CGF, sino que generaliza el modelo clásico de los juegos de congestión. Además, es el primer modelo que considera fallas dependientes de la carga en el contexto anterior.211 Organización El resto del documento se organiza de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 definimos nuestro modelo. En la Sección 3 presentamos nuestros resultados. En 3.1 mostramos que los CGLF, en general, no tienen una estrategia pura equilibrios Nash. En 3.2 nos centramos en CGLF con funciones de costos no acumulables (CGLFS no acumulables). Mostramos que estos juegos no admiten una función potencial. Sin embargo, en nuestro resultado principal mostramos la existencia de pura estrategia Nash Equilibrios en los CGLF no acumulables. La Sección 4 se dedica a una breve discusión. Muchas de las pruebas se omiten de esta versión de la conferencia del documento, y aparecerán en la versión completa.2. El modelo de los escenarios considerados en este trabajo consisten en un conjunto finito de agentes donde cada agente tiene una tarea que puede llevarse a cabo por cualquier elemento de un conjunto de recursos idénticos (proveedores de servicios). Los agentes eligen simultáneamente un subconjunto de los recursos para realizar sus tareas, y su objetivo es maximizar su propio pago esperado, como se describe en la secuela. Sea n un conjunto de n agentes (n ∈ N), y sea M un conjunto de recursos m (m ∈ N). El agente i ∈ N elige una estrategia σi ∈ σi que es un subconjunto (potencialmente vacío) de los recursos. Es decir, σi es el conjunto de potencia del conjunto de recursos: σi = p (m). Dado un subconjunto S ⊆ n de los agentes, el conjunto de combinaciones de estrategia de los miembros de S se denota mediante σs = × i∈Sσi, y el conjunto de combinaciones de estrategia del subconjunto del complemento de los agentes se denota por σ - S (σ -S (σ -−s = σn s = × i∈N sσi). El conjunto de perfiles de estrategia pura de todos los agentes se denota por σ (σ = σn). Cada recurso está asociado con un costo, C (·) y una probabilidad de falla, F (·), cada uno de los cuales depende del número de agentes que usan este recurso. Suponemos que las probabilidades de falla de los recursos son independientes. Sea σ = (σ1, ..., σn) ∈ σ sea un perfil de estrategia puro. El vector de congestión (M-dimensional) que corresponde a σ es hσ = (hσ e) e∈M, donde hσ e = ˛ ˛ {i ∈ N: e ∈ σi} ˛ ˛. La probabilidad de falla de un recurso E es una función monótona que no es de acuerdo F: {1 ,..., n} → [0, 1) de la congestión experimentada por e.El costo de utilizar el recurso E es una función C: {1 ,..., n} → r+ de la congestión experimentada por e.El resultado para el agente i ∈ N se denota mediante xi ∈ {S, F}, donde S y F, respectivamente, indican si la ejecución de la tarea tuvo éxito o falló. Decimos que la ejecución de los agentes que la tarea tiene éxito si la tarea del Agente I se completa con éxito por al menos uno de los recursos elegidos por él. El beneficio del Agente I de su resultado Xi se denota por VI (xi), donde vi (s) = vi, un valor dado (no negativo), y vi (f) = 0. La utilidad del agente I del perfil de estrategia σ y su resultado xi, UI (σ, xi), es la diferencia entre su beneficio del resultado (VI (xi)) y la suma de los costos de los recursos que ha utilizado: UI(σ, xi) = vi (xi) - x e∈σi c (hσ e). La utilidad esperada del agente I del perfil de estrategia σ, ui (σ), es, por lo tanto: ui (σ) = 1 - y ee∈σi f (hσ e)!vi - x e∈σi c (hσ e), donde 1 - q e∈σi f (hσ e) denota la probabilidad de completar con éxito el agente es la tarea. Usamos la convención queq e∈∅ f (hσ e) = 1. Por lo tanto, si el agente i elige un conjunto vacío σi = ∅ (no asigna su tarea a ningún recurso), entonces su utilidad esperada, UI (∅, σ - I), es igual a cero.3. Equilibrios de Nash de estrategia pura en CGLFS En esta sección presentamos nuestros resultados en CGLF. Investigamos la propiedad de la (no) existencia de pura estrategia Nash Equilibrios en estos juegos. Mostramos que esta clase de juegos no posee equilibrios de estrategia pura. Sin embargo, si las funciones de costo de recursos no son decisivas, entonces se garantizan que existan estos equilibrios, a pesar de la inexistencia de una función potencial.3.1 Funciones de costo decrecientes Comenzamos al demostrar que la clase de CGLF y, en particular, la subclase de CGLF con funciones de costo decrecientes, en general, no posee equilibrios de Nash en estrategias puras. Considere un CGLF con dos agentes (n = {1, 2}) y dos recursos (M = {E1, E2}). La función de costo de cada recurso viene dada por C (x) = 1 xx, donde x ∈ {1, 2}, y las probabilidades de falla son F (1) = 0.01 y F (2) = 0.26. Los beneficios de los agentes de la finalización exitosa de la tarea son V1 = 1.1 y V2 = 4. A continuación presentamos la matriz de pago del juego.∅ {e1} {e2} {e1, e2} ∅ u1 = 0 u1 = 0 u1 = 0 u1 = 0 u2 = 0 u2 = 2.96 u2 = 2.96 u2 = 1.9996 {e1} u1 = 0.089 u1 = 0.564 u1 = 0.089 u1= 0.564 u2 = 0 u2 = 2.71 u2 = 2.96 u2 = 2.7396 {e2} u1 = 0.089 u1 = 0.089 u1 = 0.564 u1 = 0.564 u2 = 0 u2 = 2.96 u2 = 2.71 u2 = 2.7396 {e1, e2} U1 = −0.90011U1 = −0.15286 U1 = −0.15286 u1 = 0.52564 u2 = 0 u2 = 2.71 u2 = 2.71 u2 = 3.2296 Tabla 1: Ejemplo para la no existencia de la estrategia pura equilibria de nash en los CGLFS. Se puede ver fácilmente que para cada perfil de estrategia puro σ en este juego existen un agente I y una estrategia σi ∈ σi tal que ui (σ - i, σi)> ui (σ). Es decir, cada perfil de estrategia pura en este juego no está en equilibrio. Sin embargo, si las funciones de costo en un CGLF determinado no disminuyen en el número de usuarios, entonces, como mostramos en el resultado principal de este documento, se garantiza que existirá una estrategia pura que existirá.212 3.2 Funciones de costo no acumulador Esta sección se centra en la subclase de CGLF con funciones de costo no acelerantes (en adelante, CGLFS no generales). Mostramos que los CGLF no lo es, en general, no admiten una función potencial. Por lo tanto, estos juegos no son juegos de congestión. Sin embargo, demostramos que todos estos juegos poseen pura estrategia Nash Equilibrios.3.2.1 La (no) existencia de una función potencial recuerda que Monderer y Shapley [9] introdujeron las nociones de función potencial y juego potencial, donde el juego potencial se define como un juego que posee una función potencial. Una función potencial es una función de valor real sobre el conjunto de perfiles de estrategia pura, con la propiedad de que la ganancia (o pérdida) de un agente que cambia a otra estrategia, mientras que las estrategias de los otros agentes se mantienen sin cambios, es igual al incremento correspondiente del incremento delfunción potencial. Los autores [9] mostraron que las clases de juegos potenciales finitos y juegos de congestión coinciden. Aquí mostramos que la clase de CGLFS y, en particular, la subclase de los CGLF no acumulables, no admite una función potencial y, por lo tanto, no está incluida en la clase de juegos de congestión. Sin embargo, para el caso especial de las probabilidades de falla constante, se garantiza que existirá una función potencial. Para probar estas declaraciones, utilizamos la siguiente caracterización de los juegos potenciales [9]. Una ruta en σ es una secuencia τ = (σ0 → σ1 → · · · ·) de modo que por cada k ≥ 1 existe un agente único, digamos el agente I, de modo que σk = (σk - 1 −i, σi)σi = σk - 1 I en σi. Una ruta finita τ = (σ0 → σ1 → · · · → σk) está cerrada si σ0 = σk. Es una ruta cerrada simple si además σl = σk por cada 0 ≤ l = k ≤ k - 1. La longitud de una ruta cerrada simple se define como el número de puntos distintos en él;Es decir, la longitud de τ = (σ0 → σ1 → · · · → σk) es K. Teorema 1. [9] Sea G un juego en forma estratégica con un vector u = (u1, .., un)de funciones de utilidad. Para una ruta finita τ = (σ0 → σ1 → · · · → σk), deje u (τ) = pk k = 1 [uik (σk) - uik (σk - 1)], donde ik es el desviador único en el pasok.Entonces, G es un juego potencial si y solo si u (τ) = 0 para cada ruta cerrada simple τ de longitud 4. Fallas dependientes de la carga basadas en el Teorema 1, presentamos el siguiente contraejemplo que demuestra la inexistencia de una función potencial en CGLFS. Consideramos el siguiente juego de agente-simétrico G en el que dos agentes (n = {1, 2}) desean asignar una tarea a dos recursos (M = {e1, e2}). El beneficio de una tarea exitosa de cada agente es igual a V, y la función de probabilidad de falla aumenta estrictamente con la congestión. Considere la ruta cerrada simple de la longitud 4 que está formada por α = (∅, {e2}), β = ({e1}, {e2}), γ = ({e1}, {e1, e2}), Δ =(∅, {e1, e2}): {e2} {e1, e2} ∅ u1 = 0 u1 = 0 u2 = (1 - f (1)) v - c (1) u2 = `1 - f (1)2 ´ v - 2c (1) {e1} u1 = (1 - f (1)) v - c (1) u1 = (1 - f (2)) v - c (2) u2 = (1 - f (1)) V-C (1) U2 = (1-F (1) F (2)) V-C (1)-C (2) Tabla 2: Ejemplo para la no existencia de potenciales en CGLFS. Por lo tanto, U1 (α) - U1 (β) + U2 (β) - U2 (γ) + U1 (γ) - U1 (δ) + U2 (δ) - U2 (α) = V (1 - F (1)) (f (1) - f (2)) = 0. Por lo tanto, por el Teorema 1, los CGLF no acumulables no admiten potenciales. Como resultado, no son juegos de congestión. Sin embargo, como se presenta en la siguiente sección, el caso especial en el que las probabilidades de falla son constantes, siempre posee una función potencial. Probabilidades de falla constante que mostramos a continuación que los CGLF con las probabilidades de falla constante siempre poseen una función potencial. Esto se deduce del hecho de que el beneficio esperado (ingresos) de cada agente en este caso no depende de las elecciones de los otros agentes. Además, para cada agente, la suma de los costos sobre su subconjunto elegido de recursos, es igual al pago de un agente que elige la misma estrategia en el juego de congestión correspondiente. Suponga que se nos da un juego G con probabilidades de falla constante. Sea τ = (α → β → γ → δ → α) una ruta cerrada simple arbitraria de la longitud 4. Deje que I y J denoten los agentes activos (desviadores) en τ y z ∈ σ− {i, j} ser un perfil de estrategia fijo de los otros agentes. Sea α = (xi, xj, z), β = (yi, xj, z), γ = (yi, yj, z), Δ = (xi, yj, z), donde xi, yi ∈ σi y xj,yj ∈ σj. Entonces, u (τ) = ui (xi, xj, z) - ui (yi, xj, z) +uj (yi, xj, z) - uj (yi, yj, z) +ui (yi, yj, z) - ui (xi, yj, z) +uJ (xi, yj, z) - uJ (xi, xj, z) = 1 - f | xi |vi - x e∈Xi c (h (xi, xj, z) e) -...- 1 - f | xj |vj + x e∈Xj c (h (xi, xj, z) e) = »1 - f | xi |VI -...- 1 - f | xj |vj - »x e∈Xi c (h (xi, xj, z) e) -...- x e∈Xj c (h (xi, xj, z) e). Observe que »1 - f | xi |VI -...- 1 - f | xj |VJ = 0, como una suma de una serie de telescopio. La suma restante es igual a 0, al aplicar el Teorema 1 a los juegos de congestión, que se sabe que poseen una función potencial. Por lo tanto, por el Teorema 1, G es un juego potencial.213 Observamos que el resultado anterior se mantiene también para la configuración más general con recursos no idénticos (con diferentes probabilidades de falla y funciones de costos) y funciones de costo general (no necesariamente monótonas y/o no negativas).3.2.2 La existencia de una estrategia pura Equilibrio de Nash en la sección anterior, hemos demostrado que los CGLF y, en particular, los CGLF de nocribientes no admiten una función potencial, pero este hecho, en general, no contradice la existencia de unequilibrio en estrategias puras. En esta sección, presentamos y demostramos el resultado principal de este documento (Teorema 2) que muestra la existencia de la estrategia pura equilibrios Nash en los CGLF no acumulables. Teorema 2. Cada CGLF no lograje posee un equilibrio de Nash en estrategias puras. La prueba del teorema 2 se basa en Lemmas 4, 7 y 8, que se presentan en la secuela. Comenzamos con algunas definiciones y observaciones necesarias para sus pruebas. En particular, presentamos las nociones de estabilidad A, D y S y mostramos que un perfil de estrategia está en equilibrio si y solo si es A, D y Sestable. Además, demostramos la existencia de dicho perfil en cualquier CGLF nocribible. Definición 3. Para cualquier perfil de estrategia σ ∈ σ y para cualquier agente I ∈ N, el funcionamiento de agregar precisamente un recurso a su estrategia, σi, se llama a-Move de I de σ. Del mismo modo, la operación de dejar caer un solo recurso se llama D-MOVE, y la operación de cambiar un recurso con otro se llama S-MOVE. Claramente, si el agente I se desvía de la estrategia σi a la estrategia σi aplicando un solo a-, d o s-m-move, entonces max {| σi σi |, | σi σi |} = 1, y viceversa, si max {|σi σi |, | σi σi |} = 1 entonces σi se obtiene de σi aplicando exactamente uno de esos movimientos. Para simplificar la exposición, para cualquier par de conjuntos A y B, vaya µ (a, b) = max {| a b |, | b a |}. El siguiente lema implica que cualquier perfil de estrategia, en el que ningún agente desea unilateralmente aplicar un solo A-, Dor S-Move, es un equilibrio de Nash. Más precisamente, mostramos que si existe un agente que se beneficia de una desviación unilateral de un perfil de estrategia determinado, entonces existe una sola A, D o S-MOVE que también es rentable para él. Lema 4. Dado un CGLF no decisivo, deje σ ∈ σ un perfil de estrategia que no está en equilibrio, y permita que i ∈ N tal que ∃xi ∈ σi para el cual Ui (σ - I, xi)> ui (σ). Luego, existe yi ∈ σi tal que ui (σ - i, yi)> ui (σ) y µ (yi, σi) = 1. Por lo tanto, para demostrar la existencia de una estrategia pura de equilibrio de Nash, es suficiente buscar un perfil de estrategia para el cual ningún agente desea aplicar unilateralmente un a, o S-MOVE. Basado en la observación anterior, definimos A, D y Sstabilidad de la siguiente manera. Definición 5. Se dice que un perfil de estrategia σ es A-Stable (resp., D-Stable, S-Stable) si no hay agentes con una A- (resp., D-, S-) rentable de σ. Del mismo modo, definimos un perfil de estrategia σ para ser DS-estable si no hay agentes con un D o S-MOVE rentable de σ. El conjunto de todos los perfiles de estrategia de DS-Stable se denota por σ0. Obviamente, el perfil (∅, ..., ∅) es DS-Stable, por lo que σ0 no está vacío. Nuestro objetivo es encontrar un perfil DS-Stable para el cual no exista A-Move rentable, lo que implica que este perfil está en equilibrio. Para describir cómo logramos esto, definimos las nociones de recursos ligeros (pesados) y (casi) incluso perfiles de estrategia, que juegan un papel central en la prueba de nuestro resultado principal. Definición 6. Dado un perfil de estrategia σ, el recurso E se llama σ-luz si hσ e ∈ Arg minele∈M hσ e y σ-heavy de otra manera. Un perfil de estrategia σ sin recursos pesados se denominará incluso. Un perfil de estrategia σ satisfactorio | hσ e - hσ e |≤ 1 Para todos los e, e ∈ M se denominará casi incluso. Obviamente, cada perfil de estrategia uniforme es casi incluso. Además, en un perfil de estrategia casi incluso, todos los recursos pesados (si existen) tienen la misma congestión. También observamos que el perfil (∅, ..., ∅) es uniforme (y DS-Stable), por lo que el subconjunto de perfiles de estrategia estables de DS no está vacío. Según las observaciones anteriores, definimos dos tipos de una A-MOVE que se usan en la secuela. Supongamos que σ ∈ σ0 es un perfil de estrategia de Estable DS casi incluso DS. Para cada agente i ∈ N, deje ei ∈ Arg mine∈M σi Hσ e. Es decir, EI es un recurso más ligero no elegido previamente por i. Luego, si existe un A-MOVE rentable para el Agente I, entonces el A-MOVE con EI también es rentable para I también. Esto es ya que si el agente i desea agregar unilateralmente un recurso, digamos a ∈ M σi, entonces ui (σ - i, (σi ∪ {a}))> ui (σ). Por lo tanto, 1 - y e E∈σi f (hσ e) f (hσ a + 1)!vi - x e∈σi c (hσ e) - c (hσ a + 1)> 1 - y ee∈Fσi f (hσ e)!vi - x e∈σi c (hσ e) ⇒ vi y e∈σi f (hσ e)> c (hσ a + 1) 1 - f (hσ a + 1) ≥ c (hσ ei + 1) 1 - f(hσ ei + 1) ⇒ ui (σ - i, (σi ∪ {ei}))> ui (σ). Si ningún agente desea cambiar su estrategia de esta manera, es decir, Ui (σ) ≥ ui (σ -i, σi ∪ {ei}) para todo lo i ∈ N, luego por la ui (σ) ≥ ui (σ - σi ∪ {a}) para todos i ∈ N ya ∈ M σi. Por lo tanto, σ es A-Stable y por Lemma 4, σ es un perfil de estrategia de equilibrio NASH. De lo contrario, deje que n (σ) denote el subconjunto de todos los agentes para los cuales existe que existe de tal manera que una adición unilateral de EI sea rentable. Deje a ∈ Arg minei: i∈N (σ) Hσ ei. Sea también I ∈ N (σ) el agente para el cual ei = a. Si a es σ-luz, entonces deje σ = (σ-i, σi ∪ {a}). En este caso, decimos que σ se obtiene de σ mediante una adición de un paso de recurso A, y A se llama recurso agregado. Si a es σ-pesado, entonces existe un recurso σ-luz by un agente j tal que a ∈ σj y b /∈ σj. Entonces deje σ = `σ− {i, j}, σi ∪ {a}, (σj {a}) ∪ {b} ´. En este caso, decimos que σ se obtiene de σ mediante una adición de dos pasos del recurso B, y B se llama recurso agregado. Notamos que, en ambos casos, la congestión de cada recurso en σ es la misma que en σ, excepto por el recurso agregado, para el cual su congestión en σ aumentó en 1. Por lo tanto, dado que el recurso agregado es σ-luz y σ es casi incluso, σ es casi incluso. Luego, el siguiente lema implica la sstabilidad de σ.214 LEMMA 7. En un CGLF no económico, cada perfil de estrategia casi incluso es stable. Junto con el lema 7, el siguiente lema muestra que si σ es un perfil de estrategia casi de punto y ds-estable, y σ se obtiene de σ por una adición de recurso A de uno o dos pasos, entonces la única causa potencial de ALa no duente de σ es la existencia de un agente k ∈ N con σk = σk, que desea soltar el recurso agregado a.Lema 8. Sea σ un perfil de estrategia estable casi de incluso DS de un CGLF nocreante dado, y se obtenga σ de σ mediante una adición de recurso a uno o dos pasos a. Entonces, no hay movimientos D rentables para ningún agente i ∈ N con σi = σi. Para un agente i ∈ N con σi = σi, el único D-MOVE rentable posible (si existe) es soltar el recurso agregado a. Ahora estamos listos para demostrar nuestro resultado principal: el Teorema 2. Describamos brevemente la idea detrás de la prueba. Por Lemma 4, es suficiente probar la existencia de un perfil de estrategia que es estable A, D y S. Comenzamos con el conjunto de perfiles de estrategia uniforme y DS-Stable que obviamente no está vacío. En este conjunto, consideramos el subconjunto de perfiles de estrategia con máxima congestión y suma máxima de los servicios públicos de los agentes. Suponiendo que, por el contrario, cada perfil de Dsstable admite un A-Move rentable, mostramos la existencia de un perfil de estrategia X en el subconjunto anterior, de modo que una adición (de un solo paso) de algún recurso A a X da como resultado una estrategia de Dsstable. Luego, por una serie finita de operaciones de adición de uno o dos pasos, obtenemos un perfil de estrategia estable de DS con una congestión estrictamente más alta en los recursos, que contradicen la elección de x. La prueba completa se presenta a continuación. Prueba del teorema 2: Sea σ1 ⊆ σ0 el subconjunto de todos los perfiles de estrategia de DS-Stable. Observe que ya que (∅, ..., ∅) es un perfil de estrategia parestable par, entonces σ1 no está vacío, y minσ∈σ0 ˛ ˛ {e ∈ M: E es σ-pesado} ˛ ˛ = 0. Entonces, σ1 también podría definirse como σ1 = arg min σ∈σ0 ˛ ˛ {e ∈ M: E es σ -pesado} ˛ ˛, siendo Hσ la congestión común. Ahora, deje que σ2 ⊆ σ1 sea el subconjunto de σ1 que consiste en todos esos perfiles con máxima congestión en los recursos. Es decir, σ2 = arg max σ∈σ1 hσ. Deje un (σ) = p i∈N ui (σ) denota la utilidad del grupo de los agentes, y sea σ3 ⊆ σ2 el subconjunto de todos los perfiles en σ2 con utilidad de grupo máximo. Es decir, σ3 = arg max σ∈Fσ2 x i∈N ui (σ) = arg max σ∈σ2 un (σ). Considere primero el caso simple en el que maxσ∈σ1 hσ = 0. Obviamente, en este caso, σ1 = σ2 = σ3 = {x = (∅, ..., ∅)}. A continuación mostramos que al realizar una serie finita de operaciones de adición (onestep) en X, obtenemos un perfil de estrategia y uniformes con mayor congestión, es decir con hy> hx = 0, en contradicción a x ∈ σ2. Sea z ∈ σ0 como un perfil DS-Stable casi de incluso siquiera (ni necesariamente uniforme) de tal manera que el mío Hz e = 0, y tenga en cuenta que el perfil x satisface las condiciones anteriores. Sea n (z) el subconjunto de agentes para los cuales existe una A-MOVE rentable, y deje que i ∈ N (Z). Obviamente, existe un recurso Z-Light A tal que ui (z-i, zi ∪ {a})> ui (z) (de lo contrario, arg mine∈M hz e ⊆ zi, en contradicción a la mía Hz e =0). Considere el perfil de estrategia z = (z-i, zi ∪ {a}) que se obtiene de z por una adición (de un solo paso) del recurso A por agente i. Dado que Z está casi incluso y A es Z-Light, podemos ver fácilmente que Z está casi incluso. Entonces, Lemma 7 implica que Z es S-Stable. Dado que yo es el único agente que usa el recurso A en Z, por Lemma 8, no hay movimientos D rentables disponibles. Por lo tanto, Z es un perfil de estrategia DS-Stable. Por lo tanto, dado que el número de recursos es finito, hay una serie finita de operaciones de adición de un solo paso en x = (∅, ..., ∅) que conduce al perfil de estrategia y ∈ σ1 con hy = 1> 0 = hx,en contradicción a x ∈ σ2. Ahora giramos para considerar el otro caso donde maxσ∈σ1 hσ ≥ 1. En este caso, seleccionamos entre σ3 un perfil de estrategia x, como se describe a continuación, y lo usamos para contradecir nuestra suposición contraria. Específicamente, mostramos que existe x ∈ σ3 tal que para todos J ∈ N, VJF (Hx) | XJ | −1 ≥ C (Hx + 1) 1 - F (Hx + 1).(1) Sea x un perfil de estrategia que se obtiene de x por una adición (de un solo paso) de algún recurso a ∈ M por algún agente i ∈ N (x) (tenga en cuenta que x es casi incluso, incluso). Entonces, (1) se deriva de y esencialmente equivalente a la desigualdad Uj (x) ≥ Uj (x - j, xj {a}), para todos a ∈ Xj. Es decir, después de realizar un A-MOVE con A de I, no hay D-MOVE rentable con a. Luego, por Lemmas 7 y 8, x es DS-Stable. Siguiendo las mismas líneas que anteriormente, construimos un procedimiento que se inicializa en x y logra un perfil de estrategia y ∈ σ1 con hy> hx, en contradicción a x ∈ σ2. Ahora, confirmemos la existencia de x ∈ σ3 que satisface (1). Sea x ∈ σ3 y M (x) sea el subconjunto de todos los recursos para los cuales existe una adición rentable (de un solo paso). Primero, mostramos que (1) se mantiene para todos j ∈ N tal que xj ∩m (x) = ∅, es decir, para todos esos agentes con uno de sus recursos deseados por otro agente. Deje a ∈ M (x), y sea x el perfil de estrategia que se obtiene de x por la adición (de un solo paso) de A por agente i. Suponga, por el contrario, que hay un agente j con a ∈ Xj tal que vjf (hx) | xj | −1 <c (hx + 1) 1 - f (hx + 1). Sea x = (x - j, xj {a}). A continuación, demostramos que X es un perfil de estrategia Estable DS y, dado que X y X corresponden al mismo vector de congestión, concluimos que X se encuentra en σ2. Además, mostramos que un (x)> un (x), contradiciendo el hecho de que x ∈ σ3. Para mostrar que x ∈ σ0 observamos que X es un perfil de estrategia uniforme y, por lo tanto, no se pueden realizar movimientos S para x. Además, dado que hx = hx y x ∈ σ0, no hay movimientos D rentables para ningún agente k = i, j. Queda por demostrar que no hay movimientos D rentables para los agentes I y J también.215 Dado que ui (x)> ui (x), obtenemos vif (hx) | xi |> c (hx + 1) 1 - f (hx + 1) ⇒ vif (hx) | xi | −1 = vif (hx) | xi |> c (hx + 1) 1 - f (hx + 1)> c (hx) 1 - f (hx) = c (hx) 1 - f (hx), lo que implica ui (x)> ui (x - i, xi {b}), para todos b ∈ Xi. Por lo tanto, no hay movimientos D rentables para el agente i. Por la estabilidad ds de x, para el agente j y para todos b ∈ Xj, tenemos UJ (x) ≥ Uj (x-j, xj {b}) ⇒ vjf (hx) | xj | −1 ≥ c (hx) 1 - f (hx). Entonces, vjf (hx) | xj | −1> vjf (hx) | xj |= vjf (hx) | xj | −1 ≥ c (hx) 1 - f (hx) = c (hx) 1 - f (hx) ⇒ uJ (x)> uJ (x - j, xj {b}),Para todos b ∈ Xi. Por lo tanto, X es DS-Stable y se encuentra en σ2. Para mostrar que un (x), la utilidad grupal de x, satisface un (x)> un (x), observamos que hx = hx y, por lo tanto, UK (x) = uk (x), para todos k ∈ N {I, J}. Por lo tanto, tenemos que mostrar que ui (x) + uJ (x)> ui (x) + uJ (x), o ui (x) - ui (x)> uJ (x) - uJ (x). Observe que ui (x)> ui (x) ⇒ vif (hx) | xi |> c (hx + 1) 1 - f (hx + 1) y uJ (x) <uJ (x) ⇒ vjf (hx) | xj | −1 <c (hx + 1) 1 - f (hx + 1), que produce vif (hx) | xi |> vjf (hx) | xj | −1. Así, ui (x) - ui (x) = 1 - f (hx) | xi | +1 vi - (| xi | + 1) c (hx) - h 1 - f (hx) | xi |vi - | xi | c (hx) i = vif (hx) | xi |(1 - f (hx)) - c (hx)> vjf (hx) | xj | −1 (1 - f (hx)) - c (hx) = 1 - f (hx) | xj |vj - | xj | c (hx) - h 1 - f (hx) | xj | −1 vj - (| xi | - 1) c (hx) i = uJ (x) - uJ (x). Por lo tanto, X se encuentra en σ2 y satisface un (x)> un (x), en contradicción a x ∈ σ3. Por lo tanto, si x ∈ σ3 entonces (1) se sostiene para todos j ∈ N tal que xj ∩m (x) = ∅. Ahora veamos que existe x ∈ σ3 tal que (1) se mantiene para todos los agentes. Para eso, elija un agente I ∈ Arg Mink∈N Vif (Hx) | Xk |. Si existe a ∈ Xi ∩ m (x), entonces satisface (1), lo que implica por la elección del agente I, que lo anterior obviamente produce la corrección de (1) para cualquier agente k ∈ N. de lo contrario, si no hay recurso enXi se encuentra en m (x), luego deje a ∈ Xi y a ∈ M (x). Dado que a ∈ Xi, a /∈ Xi, y hx a = hx a, entonces existe el agente j tal que a ∈ Xj y a /∈ Xj. Uno puede verificar fácilmente que el perfil de estrategia x = `x− {i, j}, (xi {a}) ∪ {a}, (xj {a}) ∪ {a} ´ se encuentra en σ3. Por lo tanto, x satisface (1) para el agente I y, por lo tanto, para cualquier agente k ∈ N. ahora, deje que x ∈ σ3 satisface (1). A continuación mostramos que al realizar una serie finita de operaciones de adición de uno y dos pasos en X, podemos lograr un perfil de estrategia y que se encuentra en σ1, de modo que hy> hx, en contradicción a x ∈ σ2. Sea z ∈ σ0 como un perfil de estrategia casi-incluso (ni necesariamente uniforme), ds-estable, de modo que Vi y e∈Zi {b} f (hz e) ≥ c (hz b + 1) 1-f (hz b b ++ 1), (2) para todos los i ∈ N y para todos los recursos de la luz Z b ∈ Zi. Observamos que para el perfil x ∈ σ3 ⊆ σ1, con todos los recursos que son X-Light, las condiciones (2) y (1) son equivalentes. Deje que Z se obtenga de Z mediante una adición de uno o dos pasos de un recurso Z-Light A. Obviamente, Z está casi incluso. Además, Hz E ≥ Hz E para todos e ∈ M, y el mío Hz E ≥ mine Much Hz e.Para completar la prueba, debemos demostrar que Z es DS-Stable y, además, que si el mío Hz Hz e = Mine∈M Hz E, entonces Z tiene propiedad (2). La estabilidad DS de Z sigue directamente de Lemmas 7 y 8, y de (2) con respecto a Z. Queda por probar la propiedad (2) para z con la mía∈M Hz E = Mine∈M Hz E.Usando (2) con respecto a Z, para cualquier agente k con zk = zk y para cualquier recurso Zlight b ∈ Zk, obtenemos VK y e∈Zk {b} f (hz e) ≥ vk y e∈Zk {b}F (Hz E) ≥ C (Hz B + 1) 1 - F (Hz B + 1) = C (Hz B + 1) 1 - F (Hz B + 1), según sea necesario. Ahora consideremos el resto de los agentes. Suponga que Z se obtiene mediante la adición de un paso de A por agente i. En este caso, I es el único agente con Zi = Zi. La propiedad requerida para el agente I sigue directamente desde ui (z)> ui (z). En el caso de una adición de dos pasos, Let Z = `z− {i, j}, zi ∪ {b}, (zj {b}) ∪ {a}), donde b es un recurso z-pesado. Para el agente I, de ui (z - i, zi ∪ {b})> ui (z) obtenemos 1 - y ee∈Zi f (hz e) f (hz b + 1)!Vi - x e∈Zi c (Hz E) - C (Hz B + 1)> 1 - y e E∈Zi f (Hz E)!vi - x e∈Zi c (Hz e) ⇒ Vi y e∈Zi f (Hz E)> C (Hz B + 1) 1 - F (Hz B + 1), (3) y tenga en cuenta que desde Hz B ≥Hz e para todos los e ∈ M y, en particular, para todos los recursos de la luz z, entonces c (Hz B + 1) 1 -F (Hz B + 1) ≥ C (Hz E + 1) 1 -F (Hz E+ 1), (4) para cualquier recurso Z -light e.216 Ahora, dado que Hz E ≥ Hz e para todos los e ∈ M y B es Z-Heavavy, entonces Vi y E∈Zi {E} F (Hz E) ≥ Vi y E∈Zi {E} F (Hz E) = = =vi y e∈ (zi∪ {b}) {e} f (hz e) ≥ vi y e∈Zi f (hz e), para cualquier recurso de luz z. Lo anterior, junto con (3) y (4), produce lo requerido. Para el Agente J solo usamos (2) con respecto a Z y la igualdad Hz B = Hz A. Para cualquier recurso Z -light E, Vj y E∈Zj {E} F (Hz E) ≥ Vi y E∈Zi {E} F (Hz E) ≥ C (Hz E + 1) 1 -F (Hz E +1) = C (Hz E + 1) 1 - F (Hz E + 1). Por lo tanto, dado que el número de recursos es finito, hay una serie finita de operaciones de adición de uno y dos pasos en x que conduce al perfil de estrategia y ∈ σ1 con hy> hx, en contradicción a x ∈ σ2. Esto completa la prueba.4. Discusión En este documento, presentamos e investigamos la configuración de congestión con recursos poco confiables, en los que la probabilidad de una falla de recursos depende de la congestión experimentada por este recurso. Definimos una clase de juegos de congestión con fallas dependientes de la carga (CGLF), que generaliza la conocida clase de juegos de congestión. Estudiamos la existencia de pura estrategia Nash Equilibrios y posibles funciones en la clase de juegos presentada. Mostramos que estos juegos, en general, no poseen equilibrios de estrategia pura. Sin embargo, si las funciones de costo de recursos no son decisivas, entonces se garantizan que existan estos equilibrios, a pesar de la inexistencia de una función potencial. El modelo CGLF puede modificarse en el caso donde los agentes pagan solo por los recursos no cultivados que seleccionaron. Tanto el modelo discutido en este documento como el modificado son razonables. En la versión completa mostraremos que el modelo modificado conduce a resultados similares. En particular, podemos mostrar la existencia de un equilibrio de estrategia pura para los CGLF no que no sean también en el modelo modificado. En futuras investigaciones planeamos considerar varias extensiones de CGLF. En particular, planeamos considerar CGLF donde los recursos pueden tener diferentes costos y probabilidades de falla, así como CGLF en los que las probabilidades de falla del recurso dependen mutuamente. Además, es interesante desarrollar un algoritmo eficiente para el cálculo del equilibrio de la estrategia pura Nash, así como discutir la eficiencia social (in) de los equilibrios.5.

        "INTRODUCTION We study the effects of resource failures in congestion settings.",
        "This study is motivated by a variety of situations in multi-agent systems with unreliable components, such as machines, computers etc.",
        "We define a model for congestion games with load-dependent failures (CGLFs) which provides simple and natural description of such situations.",
        "In this model, we are given a finite set of identical resources (service providers) where each element possesses a failure probability describing the probability of unsuccessful completion of its assigned tasks as a (nondecreasing) function of its congestion.",
        "There is a fixed number of agents, each having a task which can be carried out by any of the resources.",
        "For reliability reasons, each agent may decide to assign his task, simultaneously, to a number of resources.",
        "Thus, the congestion on the resources is not known in advance, but is strategy-dependent.",
        "Each resource is associated with a cost, which is a (nonnegative) function of the congestion experienced by this resource.",
        "The objective of each agent is to maximize his own utility, which is the difference between his benefit from successful task completion and the sum of the costs over the set of resources he uses.",
        "The benefits of the agents from successful completion of their tasks are allowed to vary across the agents.",
        "The resource cost function describes the cost suffered by an agent for selecting that resource, as a function of the number of agents who have selected it.",
        "Thus, it is natural to assume that these functions are nonnegative.",
        "In addition, in many real-life applications of our model the resource cost functions have a special structure.",
        "In particular, they can monotonically increase or decrease with the number of the users, depending on the context.",
        "The former case is motivated by situations where high congestion on a resource causes longer delay in its assigned tasks execution and as a result, the cost of utilizing this resource might be higher.",
        "A typical example of such situation is as follows.",
        "Assume we need to deliver an important package.",
        "Since there is no guarantee that a courier will reach the destination in time, we might send several couriers to deliver the same package.",
        "The time required by each courier to deliver the package increases with the congestion on his way.",
        "In addition, the payment to a courier is proportional to the time he spends in delivering the package.",
        "Thus, the payment to the courier increases when the congestion increases.",
        "The latter case (decreasing cost functions) describes situations where a group of agents using a particular resource have an opportunity to share its cost among the groups members, or, the cost of 210 using a resource decreases with the number of users, according to some marketing policy.",
        "Our results We show that CGLFs and, in particular, CGLFs with nondecreasing cost functions, do not admit a potential function.",
        "Therefore, the CGLF model can not be reduced to congestion games.",
        "Nevertheless, if the failure probabilities are constant (do not depend on the congestion) then a potential function is guaranteed to exist.",
        "We show that CGLFs and, in particular, CGLFs with decreasing cost functions, do not possess pure strategy Nash equilibria.",
        "However, as we show in our main result, there exists a pure strategy Nash equilibrium in any CGLF with nondecreasing cost functions.",
        "Related work Our model extends the well-known class of congestion games [11].",
        "In a congestion game, every agent has to choose from a finite set of resources, where the utility (or cost) of an agent from using a particular resource depends on the number of agents using it, and his total utility (cost) is the sum of the utilities (costs) obtained from the resources he uses.",
        "An important property of these games is the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria.",
        "Monderer and Shapley [9] introduced the notions of potential function and potential game and proved that the existence of a potential function implies the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.",
        "They observed that Rosenthal [11] proved his theorem on congestion games by constructing a potential function (hence, every congestion game is a potential game).",
        "Moreover, they showed that every finite potential game is isomorphic to a congestion game; hence, the classes of finite potential games and congestion games coincide.",
        "Congestion games have been extensively studied and generalized.",
        "In particular, Leyton-Brown and Tennenholtz [5] extended the class of congestion games to the class of localeffect games.",
        "In a local-effect game, each agents payoff is effected not only by the number of agents who have chosen the same resources as he has chosen, but also by the number of agents who have chosen neighboring resources (in a given graph structure).",
        "Monderer [8] dealt with another type of generalization of congestion games, in which the resource cost functions are player-specific (PS-congestion games).",
        "He defined PS-congestion games of type q (q-congestion games), where q is a positive number, and showed that every game in strategic form is a q-congestion game for some q. Playerspecific resource cost functions were discussed for the first time by Milchtaich [6].",
        "He showed that simple and strategysymmetric PS-congestion games are not potential games, but always possess a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.",
        "PScongestion games were generalized to weighted congestion games [6] (or, ID-congestion games [7]), in which the resource cost functions are not only player-specific, but also depend on the identity of the users of the resource.",
        "Ackermann et al. [1] showed that weighted congestion games admit pure strategy Nash equilibria if the strategy space of each player consists of the bases of a matroid on the set of resources.",
        "Much of the work on congestion games has been inspired by the fact that every such game has a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.",
        "In particular, Fabrikant et al. [3] studied the computational complexity of finding pure strategy Nash equilibria in congestion games.",
        "Intensive study has also been devoted to quantify the inefficiency of equilibria in congestion games.",
        "Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [4] proposed the worst-case ratio of the social welfare achieved by a Nash equilibrium and by a socially optimal strategy profile (dubbed the price of anarchy) as a measure of the performance degradation caused by lack of coordination.",
        "Christodoulou and Koutsoupias [2] considered the price of anarchy of pure equilibria in congestion games with linear cost functions.",
        "Roughgarden and Tardos [12] used this approach to study the cost of selfish routing in networks with a continuum of users.",
        "However, the above settings do not take into consideration the possibility that resources may fail to execute their assigned tasks.",
        "In the computer science context of congestion games, where the alternatives of concern are machines, computers, communication lines etc., which are obviously prone to failures, this issue should not be ignored.",
        "Penn, Polukarov and Tennenholtz were the first to incorporate the issue of failures into congestion settings [10].",
        "They introduced a class of congestion games with failures (CGFs) and proved that these games, while not being isomorphic to congestion games, always possess Nash equilibria in pure strategies.",
        "The CGF-model significantly differs from ours.",
        "In a CGF, the authors considered the delay associated with successful task completion, where the delay for an agent is the minimum of the delays of his successful attempts and the aim of each agent is to minimize his expected delay.",
        "In contrast with the CGF-model, in our model we consider the total cost of the utilized resources, where each agent wishes to maximize the difference between his benefit from a successful task completion and the sum of his costs over the resources he uses.",
        "The above differences imply that CGFs and CGLFs possess different properties.",
        "In particular, if in our model the resource failure probabilities were constant and known in advance, then a potential function would exist.",
        "This, however, does not hold for CGFs; in CGFs, the failure probabilities are constant but there is no potential function.",
        "Furthermore, the procedures proposed by the authors in [10] for the construction of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium are not valid in our model, even in the simple, agent-symmetric case, where all agents have the same benefit from successful completion of their tasks.",
        "Our work provides the first model of congestion settings with resource failures, which considers the sum of congestiondependent costs over utilized resources, and therefore, does not extend the CGF-model, but rather generalizes the classic model of congestion games.",
        "Moreover, it is the first model to consider load-dependent failures in the above context. 211 Organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we define our model.",
        "In Section 3 we present our results.",
        "In 3.1 we show that CGLFs, in general, do not have pure strategy Nash equilibria.",
        "In 3.2 we focus on CGLFs with nondecreasing cost functions (nondecreasing CGLFs).",
        "We show that these games do not admit a potential function.",
        "However, in our main result we show the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria in nondecreasing CGLFs.",
        "Section 4 is devoted to a short discussion.",
        "Many of the proofs are omitted from this conference version of the paper, and will appear in the full version. 2.",
        "THE MODEL The scenarios considered in this work consist of a finite set of agents where each agent has a task that can be carried out by any element of a set of identical resources (service providers).",
        "The agents simultaneously choose a subset of the resources in order to perform their tasks, and their aim is to maximize their own expected payoff, as described in the sequel.",
        "Let N be a set of n agents (n ∈ N), and let M be a set of m resources (m ∈ N).",
        "Agent i ∈ N chooses a strategy σi ∈ Σi which is a (potentially empty) subset of the resources.",
        "That is, Σi is the power set of the set of resources: Σi = P(M).",
        "Given a subset S ⊆ N of the agents, the set of strategy combinations of the members of S is denoted by ΣS = ×i∈SΣi, and the set of strategy combinations of the complement subset of agents is denoted by Σ−S (Σ−S = ΣN S = ×i∈N SΣi).",
        "The set of pure strategy profiles of all the agents is denoted by Σ (Σ = ΣN ).",
        "Each resource is associated with a cost, c(·), and a failure probability, f(·), each of which depends on the number of agents who use this resource.",
        "We assume that the failure probabilities of the resources are independent.",
        "Let σ = (σ1, . . . , σn) ∈ Σ be a pure strategy profile.",
        "The (m-dimensional) congestion vector that corresponds to σ is hσ = (hσ e )e∈M , where hσ e = ˛ ˛{i ∈ N : e ∈ σi} ˛ ˛.",
        "The failure probability of a resource e is a monotone nondecreasing function f : {1, . . . , n} → [0, 1) of the congestion experienced by e. The cost of utilizing resource e is a function c : {1, . . . , n} → R+ of the congestion experienced by e. The outcome for agent i ∈ N is denoted by xi ∈ {S, F}, where S and F, respectively, indicate whether the task execution succeeded or failed.",
        "We say that the execution of agents i task succeeds if the task of agent i is successfully completed by at least one of the resources chosen by him.",
        "The benefit of agent i from his outcome xi is denoted by Vi(xi), where Vi(S) = vi, a given (nonnegative) value, and Vi(F) = 0.",
        "The utility of agent i from strategy profile σ and his outcome xi, ui(σ, xi), is the difference between his benefit from the outcome (Vi(xi)) and the sum of the costs of the resources he has used: ui(σ, xi) = Vi(xi) − X e∈σi c(hσ e ) .",
        "The expected utility of agent i from strategy profile σ, Ui(σ), is, therefore: Ui(σ) = 1 − Y e∈σi f(hσ e ) ! vi − X e∈σi c(hσ e ) , where 1 − Q e∈σi f(hσ e ) denotes the probability of successful completion of agent is task.",
        "We use the convention thatQ e∈∅ f(hσ e ) = 1.",
        "Hence, if agent i chooses an empty set σi = ∅ (does not assign his task to any resource), then his expected utility, Ui(∅, σ−i), equals zero. 3.",

        "To prove these statements we use the following characterization of potential games [9].",

        "Then by a finite series of one- or two-step addition operations we obtain an even, DS-stable strategy profile with strictly higher congestion on the resources, contradicting the choice of x.",
        "The full proof is presented below.",
        "Proof of Theorem 2: Let Σ1 ⊆ Σ0 be the subset of all even, DS-stable strategy profiles.",
        "Observe that since (∅, . . . , ∅) is an even, DS-stable strategy profile, then Σ1 is not empty, and minσ∈Σ0 ˛ ˛{e ∈ M : e is σ−heavy} ˛ ˛ = 0.",
        "Then, Σ1 could also be defined as Σ1 = arg min σ∈Σ0 ˛ ˛{e ∈ M : e is σ−heavy} ˛ ˛ , with hσ being the common congestion.",
        "Now, let Σ2 ⊆ Σ1 be the subset of Σ1 consisting of all those profiles with maximum congestion on the resources.",

        "Consider first the simple case in which maxσ∈Σ1 hσ = 0.",

        "We show below that by performing a finite series of (onestep) addition operations on x, we obtain an even, DSstable strategy profile y with higher congestion, that is with hy > hx = 0, in contradiction to x ∈ Σ2 .",
        "Let z ∈ Σ0 be a nearly-even (not necessarily even) DS-stable profile such that mine∈M hz e = 0, and note that the profile x satisfies the above conditions.",
        "Let N(z) be the subset of agents for which a profitable A-move exists, and let i ∈ N(z).",
        "Obviously, there exists a z-light resource a such that Ui(z−i, zi ∪ {a}) > Ui(z) (otherwise, arg mine∈M hz e ⊆ zi, in contradiction to mine∈M hz e = 0).",
        "Consider the strategy profile z = (z−i, zi ∪ {a}) which is obtained from z by a (one-step) addition of resource a by agent i.",
        "Since z is nearly-even and a is z-light, we can easily see that z is nearly-even.",
        "Then, Lemma 7 implies that z is S-stable.",
        "Since i is the only agent using resource a in z , by Lemma 8, no profitable D-moves are available.",
        "Thus, z is a DS-stable strategy profile.",

        "We turn now to consider the other case where maxσ∈Σ1 hσ ≥ 1.",

        "Below we demonstrate that x is a DS-stable strategy profile and, since x and x correspond to the same congestion vector, we conclude that x lies in Σ2 .",

        "To show that x ∈ Σ0 we note that x is an even strategy profile, and thus no S-moves may be performed for x .",
        "In addition, since hx = hx and x ∈ Σ0 , there are no profitable D-moves for any agent k = i, j.",
        "It remains to show that there are no profitable D-moves for agents i and j as well. 215 Since Ui(x ) > Ui(x), we get vif(hx )|xi| > c(hx + 1) 1 − f(hx + 1) ⇒ vif(hx )|xi |−1 = vif(hx )|xi| > c(hx + 1) 1 − f(hx + 1) > c(hx ) 1 − f(hx) = c(hx ) 1 − f(hx ) , which implies Ui(x ) > Ui(x−i, xi {b}), for all b ∈ xi .",

        "Thus, Ui(x ) − Ui(x) = 1 − f(hx )|xi|+1 vi − (|xi| + 1) c(hx ) − h 1 − f(hx )|xi| vi − |xi|c(hx ) i = vif(hx )|xi| (1 − f(hx )) − c(hx ) > vjf(hx )|xj |−1 (1 − f(hx )) − c(hx ) = 1 − f(hx )|xj | vj − |xj|c(hx ) − h 1 − f(hx )|xj |−1 vj − (|xi| − 1) c(hx ) i = Uj(x) − Uj(x ) .",
