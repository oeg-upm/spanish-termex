Nowadays there are dozens of academic and commercial products that allow execution of isolated tasks on grids, but few products support the enactment of long-running processes in a distributed fashion. In order to address such subject, this paper presents a programming model and an infrastructure that hierarchically schedules process activities using available nodes in a wide grid environment. Their advantages are automatic and structured distribution of activities and easy process monitoring and steering.

INTRODUCTION Grid computing is a model for wide-area distributed and parallel computing across heterogeneous networks in multiple administrative domains. This research field aims to promote sharing of resources and provides breakthrough computing power over this wide network of virtual organizations in a seamless manner [8]. Traditionally, as in Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10], there is a minimal infrastructure that provides data resource sharing, computational resource utilization management, and distributed execution. Specifically, considering distributed execution, most of the existing grid infrastructures supports execution of isolated tasks, but they do not consider their task interdependencies as in processes (workflows) [12]. This deficiency restricts better scheduling algorithms, distributed execution coordination and automatic execution recovery. There are few proposed middleware infrastructures that support process execution over the grid. In general, they model processes by interconnecting their activities through control and data dependencies. Among them, WebFlow [1] emphasizes an architecture to construct distributed processes; Opera-G [3] provides execution recovering and steering, GridFlow [5] focuses on improved scheduling algorithms that take advantage of activity dependencies, and SwinDew [13] supports totally distributed execution on peer-to-peer networks. However, such infrastructures contain scheduling algorithms that are centralized by process [1, 3, 5], or completely distributed, but difficult to monitor and control [13]. In order to address such constraints, this paper proposes a structured programming model for process description and a hierarchical process execution infrastructure. The programming model employs structured control flow to promote controlled and contextualized activity execution. Complementary, the support infrastructure, which executes a process specification, takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of a specified process in order to distribute and schedule strong dependent activities as a unit, allowing a better execution performance and fault-tolerance and providing localized communication. The programming model and the support infrastructure, named X avantes, are under implementation in order to show the feasibility of the proposed model and to demonstrate its two major advantages: to promote widely distributed process execution and scheduling, but in a controlled, structured and localized way. Next Section describes the programming model, and Section 3, the support infrastructure for the proposed grid computing model. Section 4 demonstrates how the support infrastructure executes processes and distributes activities. Related works are presented and compared to the proposed model in Section 5. The last Section concludes this paper encompassing the advantages of the proposed hierarchical process execution support for the grid computing area and lists some future works. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figure 1: High-level framework of the programming model 2. PROGRAMMING MODEL The programming model designed for the grid computing architecture is very similar to the specified to the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) [2]. Both describe processes in XML [4] documents, but the former specifies processes strictly synchronous and structured, and has more constructs for structured parallel control. The rationale behind of its design is the possibility of hierarchically distribute the process control and coordination based on structured constructs, differently from BPEL, which does not allow hierarchical composition of processes. In the proposed programming model, a process is a set of interdependent activities arranged to solve a certain problem. In detail, a process is composed of activities, subprocesses, and controllers (see Figure 1). Activities represent simple tasks that are executed on behalf of a process; subprocesses are processes executed in the context of a parent process; and controllers are control elements used to specify the execution order of these activities and subprocesses. Like structured languages, controllers can be nested and then determine the execution order of other controllers. Data are exchanged among process elements through parameters. They are passed by value, in case of simple objects, or by reference, if they are remote objects shared among elements of the same controller or process. External data can be accessed through data sources, such as relational databases or distributed objects. 2.1 Controllers Controllers are structured control constructs used to define the control flow of processes. There are sequential and parallel controllers. The sequential controller types are: block, switch, for and while. The block controller is a simple sequential construct, and the others mimic equivalent structured programming language constructs. Similarly, the parallel types are: par, parswitch, parfor and parwhile. They extend the respective sequential counterparts to allow parallel execution of process elements. All parallel controller types fork the execution of one or more process elements, and then, wait for each execution to finish. Indeed, they contain a fork and a join of execution. Aiming to implement a conditional join, all parallel controller types contain an exit condition, evaluated all time that an element execution finishes, in order to determine when the controller must end. The parfor and parwhile are the iterative versions of the parallel controller types. Both fork executions while the iteration condition is true. This provides flexibility to determine, at run-time, the number of process elements to execute simultaneously. When compared to workflow languages, the parallel controller types represent structured versions of the workflow control constructors, because they can nest other controllers and also can express fixed and conditional forks and joins, present in such languages. 2.2 Process Example This section presents an example of a prime number search application that receives a certain range of integers and returns a set of primes contained in this range. The whole computation is made by a process, which uses a parallel controller to start and dispatch several concurrent activities of the same type, in order to find prime numbers. The portion of the XML document that describes the process and activity types is shown below. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware for Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> Firstly, a process type that finds prime numbers, named FindPrimes, is defined. It receives, through its input parameters, a range of integers in which prime numbers have to be found, the number of primes to be returned, and the number of activities to be executed in order to perform this work. At the end, the found prime numbers are returned as a collection through its output parameter. This process contains a PARFOR controller aiming to execute a determined number of parallel activities. It iterates from 0 to getNumActs() - 1, which determines the number of activities, starting a parallel activity in each iteration. In such case, the controller divides the whole range of numbers in subranges of the same size, and, in each iteration, starts a parallel activity that finds prime numbers in a specific subrange. These activities receive a shared object by reference in order to store the prime numbers just found and control if the required number of primes has been reached. Finally, it is defined the activity type, FindPrimes, used to find prime numbers in each subrange. It receives, through its input parameters, the range of numbers in which it has to find prime numbers, the total number of prime numbers to be found by the whole process, and, passed by reference, a collection object to store the found prime numbers. Between its CODE markers, there is a simple code to find prime numbers, which iterates over the specified range and verifies if the current integer is a prime. Additionally, in each iteration, the code verifies if the required number of primes, inserted in the primes collection by all concurrent activities, has been reached, and exits if true. The advantage of using controllers is the possibility of the support infrastructure determines the point of execution the process is in, allowing automatic recovery and monitoring, and also the capability of instantiating and dispatching process elements only when there are enough computing resources available, reducing unnecessary overhead. Besides, due to its structured nature, they can be easily composed and the support infrastructure can take advantage of this in order to distribute hierarchically the nested controllers to Group Server Group Java Virtual Machine RMI JDBC Group Manager Process Server Java Virtual Machine RMI JDBC Process Coordinator Worker Java Virtual Machine RMI Activity Manager Repository Figure 2: Infrastructure architecture different machines over the grid, allowing enhanced scalability and fault-tolerance. 3. SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE The support infrastructure comprises tools for specification, and services for execution and monitoring of structured processes in highly distributed, heterogeneous and autonomous grid environments. It has services to monitor availability of resources in the grid, to interpret processes and schedule activities and controllers, and to execute activities. 3.1 Infrastructure Architecture The support infrastructure architecture is composed of groups of machines and data repositories, which preserves its administrative autonomy. Generally, localized machines and repositories, such as in local networks or clusters, form a group. Each machine in a group must have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) [11], and a Java Runtime Library, besides a combination of the following grid support services: group manager (GM), process coordinator (PC) and activity manager (AM). This combination determines what kind of group node it represents: a group server, a process server, or simply a worker (see Figure 2). In a group there are one or more group managers, but only one acts as primary and the others, as replicas. They are responsible to maintain availability information of group machines. Moreover, group managers maintain references to data resources of the group. They use group repositories to persist and recover the location of nodes and their availability. To control process execution, there are one or more process coordinators per group. They are responsible to instantiate and execute processes and controllers, select resources, and schedule and dispatch activities to workers. In order to persist and recover process execution and data, and also load process specification, they use group repositories. Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity manager. It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers. They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does. Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM Figure 3: Inter-group relationships connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group managers (see Figure 3). Each group manager deals with requests of its group (represented by dashed ellipses), in order to register local machines and maintain correspondent availability. Additionally, group managers communicate to group managers of other groups. Each group manager exports coarse availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and also receives requests from other external services to furnish detailed availability information. In this way, if there are resources available in external groups, it is possible to send processes, controllers and activities to these groups in order to execute them in external process coordinators and activity managers, respectively. 4. PROCESS EXECUTION In the proposed grid architecture, a process is specified in XML, using controllers to determine control flow; referencing other processes and activities; and passing objects to their parameters in order to define data flow. After specified, the process is compiled in a set of classes, which represent specific process, activity and controller types. At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group. Also, the initial parameters must be passed to it, and then it can be started. The process coordinator carries out the process by executing the process elements included in its body sequentially. If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available. Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine. Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element. Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid. It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group. Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers. Such procedure is followed recursively by all process coGM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Process PC Figure 4: FindPrimes process execution ordinators that execute subprocesses or controllers of a process. Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources. The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups. Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers. In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller. Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers. Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure. A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller. In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity. If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution. Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created. In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller. Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends. At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5. RELATED WORK There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing, aiming to provide interfaces, protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for Grid Computing 90 distributed resources in heterogeneous and autonomous networks. Among them, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10] are widely known. Aiming to standardize interfaces and services to grid, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) [7] has been defined. The grid architectures generally have services that manage computing resources and distribute the execution of independent tasks on available ones. However, emerging architectures maintain task dependencies and automatically execute tasks in a correct order. They take advantage of these dependencies to provide automatic recovery, and better distribution and scheduling algorithms. Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment. Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution. The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination. In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment. In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable. It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local. In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration. Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources. The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant. But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery. Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next. This makes easier to monitor and control processes. Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one. This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups. This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing. There are several products that support execution of independent tasks over grid, but only a few supports the execution of processes with interdependent tasks. In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that allow the execution of structured processes in a widely distributed and hierarchical manner. This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller. These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid. Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes. The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution. After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance. Finally, it is interesting to investigate schemes of dynamic modification of processes over the grid, in order to evolve and adapt long-term processes to the continuously changing grid environment. 7.

Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso.

La computación en malla es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación en malla propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la computación en malla y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura de computación en malla es muy similar al especificado en el Lenguaje de Ejecución de Procesos de Negocio (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente síncronos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basándose en construcciones estructuradas, a diferencia de BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un problema específico. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso; los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso padre; y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar el orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que en los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar el orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos del proceso a través de parámetros. Son pasados por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Los datos externos pueden ser accedidos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales u objetos distribuidos. 2.1 Controladores Los controladores son estructuras de control utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controladores secuenciales son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los demás imitan estructuras equivalentes de lenguajes de programación estructurada. De manera similar, los tipos paralelos son: par, parswitch, parfor y parwhile. Extienden los respectivos contrapartes secuenciales para permitir la ejecución en paralelo de los elementos del proceso. Todos los tipos de controladores paralelos bifurcan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego esperan a que cada ejecución termine. De hecho, contienen una bifurcación y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controladores paralelos contienen una condición de salida, evaluada cada vez que finaliza la ejecución de un elemento, para determinar cuándo debe finalizar el controlador. El parfor y el parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambos tenedores se ejecutan mientras la condición de iteración sea verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, la cantidad de elementos de proceso que se ejecutarán simultáneamente. En comparación con los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controladores paralelos representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control de flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar bifurcaciones y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en dichos lenguajes. Ejemplo de Proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe un cierto rango de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de números primos contenidos en este rango. La computación completa se realiza mediante un proceso que utiliza un controlador paralelo para iniciar y despachar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, con el fin de encontrar números primos. La porción del documento XML que describe los tipos de proceso y actividad se muestra a continuación. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware para Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> En primer lugar, se define un tipo de proceso que encuentra números primos, llamado FindPrimes. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, un rango de enteros en el que se deben encontrar números primos, la cantidad de primos a devolver y la cantidad de actividades a ejecutar para realizar este trabajo. Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades en paralelo. Itera desde 0 hasta getNumActs() - 1, lo cual determina el número de actividades, iniciando una actividad en paralelo en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subrangos del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, inicia una actividad en paralelo que encuentra números primos en un subrango específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos recién encontrados y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de primos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrango. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en el que debe encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se deben encontrar en todo el proceso y, pasado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados. Entre sus marcadores de CODE, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un número primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de números primos, insertados en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, y sale si es verdadero. La ventaja de utilizar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y monitorización automáticas, así como la capacidad de instanciar y despachar elementos del proceso solo cuando haya suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, pueden ser fácilmente compuestos y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al Grupo Servidor Grupo Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Gerente de Grupo Servidor Proceso Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Coordinador de Procesos Trabajador Máquina Virtual Java RMI Administrador de Actividades Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura en diferentes máquinas sobre la red, permitiendo una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallos. La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para la especificación y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de grid altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y programar actividades y controladores, y ejecutar actividades. 3.1 Arquitectura de Infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, que preservan su autonomía administrativa. Generalmente, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en redes locales o grupos de servidores, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) [11], y una Biblioteca de Tiempo de Ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gestor de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gestor de actividades (AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más administradores de grupo, pero solo uno actúa como principal y los demás como réplicas. Ellos son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas del grupo. Además, los gerentes de grupo mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios de grupo para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos, y programar y despachar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución de procesos y datos, y también cargar la especificación de procesos, utilizan repositorios de grupo. Finalmente, en varios nodos de grupo hay un administrador de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos de grupo, e informar sobre la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad pendientes, que contienen actividades por ejecutar. 3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar una arquitectura de red real, la infraestructura debe incluir varias, potencialmente todas, las redes locales, como lo hace Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales están conectados a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes de grupo (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se encarga de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses punteadas), con el fin de registrar las máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad correspondiente. Además, los gerentes de grupo se comunican con los gerentes de grupo de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad general a los gerentes de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gestores de actividades, respectivamente. 4. EJECUCIÓN DEL PROCESO En la arquitectura de cuadrícula propuesta, un proceso se especifica en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control; haciendo referencia a otros procesos y actividades; y pasando objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos específicos de proceso, actividad y controlador. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de procesos. Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe ser instanciado haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de procesos de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben ser pasados a él, y luego puede ser iniciado. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo de forma secuencial. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador de procesos puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de procesos en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, se pasa a un gestor de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores del proceso solicitan al gerente del grupo local encontrar máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio, coordinador del proceso o gerente de actividad requeridos, para ejecutar un elemento del proceso. Entonces, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguna, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina gestora de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local; y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos) si no hay servidores de procesos o trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local. Siguiendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupo intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de forma recursiva por todos los procesos coGM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Proceso PC Figura 4: ejecución del proceso FindPrimes por coordinadores que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, dado que los procesos están estructurados por la anidación de elementos de proceso, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente de forma jerárquica a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula según la disponibilidad y la localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la ejecución en áreas extensas, que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la red; y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, ya que los elementos fuertemente dependientes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cerca de ellos. Además, admite un monitoreo y control sencillos, gracias a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos. Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso 4.2 Retomando el ejemplo mostrado en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un rango determinado de números. Para resolver este problema, se crean una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador parfor. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra números primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso ejecutándose sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia del proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de procesos disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador parfor. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad FindPrimes. Si hay algún Administrador de Actividades (AM) disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay un administrador de actividad disponible, entonces el controlador entra en un estado de espera hasta que un administrador de actividad esté disponible o sea creado. De manera paralela, cada vez que una actividad finaliza, su resultado se envía de vuelta al coordinador del proceso, quien lo registra en el controlador de parfor. Entonces, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se han iniciado hayan terminado, y finaliza. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finaliza el proceso. 5. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Existen varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen apoyar la computación en malla, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de recursos distribuidos ampliamente en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar interfaces y servicios para la red, se ha definido la Arquitectura de Servicios de Red Abierta (OGSA). Las arquitecturas de rejilla generalmente tienen servicios que gestionan los recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en los disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen las dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en el orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar recuperación automática, y mejores algoritmos de distribución y programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de procesos y entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de actividades y su ejecución distribuida en un entorno de grid. Opera-G [3], al igual que WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de procesos similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y a los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona recuperación automática de la ejecución y un control limitado de la ejecución del proceso. Las arquitecturas previamente mencionadas y otras que llevan a cabo procesos sobre la red tienen una coordinación centralizada. Para superar esta limitación, sistemas como SwinDew [13] propusieron una ejecución de procesos ampliamente distribuida, en la que cada nodo sabe dónde ejecutar la siguiente actividad o unirse a actividades en un entorno de pares. En el área específica de distribución y programación de actividades, enfatizada en este trabajo, GridFlow [5] es notable. Utiliza una programación de dos niveles: global y local. A nivel local, cuenta con servicios que predicen la utilización de recursos informáticos y la duración de la actividad. Basándose en esta información, GridFlow emplea una técnica similar a PERT que intenta prever la hora de inicio y duración de la ejecución de las actividades para programarlas mejor con los recursos disponibles. La arquitectura propuesta en este documento, que abarca un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte de ejecución, es ampliamente descentralizada, a diferencia de WebFlow y Opera-G, siendo más escalable y tolerante a fallos. Pero, al igual que este último, está diseñado para respaldar la recuperación de la ejecución. En comparación con SwinDew, la arquitectura propuesta contiene coordinadores de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, los cuales coordinan procesos o partes de ellos de manera diferente a SwinDew, donde cada nodo tiene una vista limitada del proceso: solo la actividad que comienza a continuación. Esto facilita la supervisión y el control de los procesos. Finalmente, la infraestructura de soporte interrumpe el proceso y sus subprocesos para la ejecución en red, permitiendo a un grupo requerir a otro grupo para la coordinación y ejecución de elementos del proceso en nombre del primero. Esto es diferente de GridFlow, que puede ejecutar un proceso en un máximo de dos niveles, teniendo el nivel global como el único responsable de programar subprocesos en otros grupos. Esto puede limitar el rendimiento general de los procesos y hacer que el sistema sea menos escalable. CONCLUSIÓN Y TRABAJO FUTURO La computación en malla es un campo de investigación emergente que tiene como objetivo promover la computación distribuida y paralela en la amplia red de área de heterogéneos y autónomos dominios administrativos de manera transparente, similar a lo que Internet hace con el intercambio de datos. Hay varios productos que admiten la ejecución de tareas independientes en una cuadrícula, pero solo unos pocos admiten la ejecución de procesos con tareas interdependientes. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento propone un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte que permiten la ejecución de procesos estructurados de manera ampliamente distribuida y jerárquica. Esta infraestructura de soporte proporciona distribución automática, estructurada y recursiva de elementos de proceso sobre grupos de máquinas disponibles; mejor uso de recursos, debido a su creación bajo demanda de elementos de proceso; monitoreo y control de procesos fácil, debido a su naturaleza estructurada; y comunicación localizada entre elementos de proceso fuertemente dependientes, que se colocan bajo el mismo controlador. Estas características contribuyen a una mejor escalabilidad, tolerancia a fallos y control para la ejecución de procesos en la red. Además, abre puertas para mejores algoritmos de programación, mecanismos de recuperación y también esquemas de modificación dinámica. El próximo trabajo será la implementación de un mecanismo de recuperación que utiliza la ejecución y el estado de los datos de los procesos y controladores para recuperar la ejecución del proceso. Después de eso, es deseable avanzar en el algoritmo de programación para prever el uso de máquinas en los mismos u otros grupos y anticipar el tiempo de inicio de los elementos del proceso, con el fin de utilizar esta información para preasignar recursos y, así, obtener un mejor rendimiento en la ejecución del proceso. Finalmente, es interesante investigar esquemas de modificación dinámica de procesos en la red, con el fin de evolucionar y adaptar procesos a largo plazo al entorno de la red en constante cambio. 7.

        "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",
        "Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers.",
        "Such procedure is followed recursively by all process coGM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Process PC Figure 4: FindPrimes process execution ordinators that execute subprocesses or controllers of a process.",
        "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
        "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
        "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
        "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
        "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
        "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
        "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
        "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
        "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
        "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
        "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
        "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
        "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",
        "RELATED WORK There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing, aiming to provide interfaces, protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for Grid Computing 90 distributed resources in heterogeneous and autonomous networks.",
        "Among them, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10] are widely known.",
        "Aiming to standardize interfaces and services to grid, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) [7] has been defined.",
        "The grid architectures generally have services that manage computing resources and distribute the execution of independent tasks on available ones.",
        "However, emerging architectures maintain task dependencies and automatically execute tasks in a correct order.",
        "They take advantage of these dependencies to provide automatic recovery, and better distribution and scheduling algorithms.",
        "Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment.",
        "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
        "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
        "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
        "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
        "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
        "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
        "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
        "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
        "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
        "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
        "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
        "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
        "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
        "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",
        "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing.",
        "There are several products that support execution of independent tasks over grid, but only a few supports the execution of processes with interdependent tasks.",
        "In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that allow the execution of structured processes in a widely distributed and hierarchical manner.",
        "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
        "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
        "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
        "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
        "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",
        "Finally, it is interesting to investigate schemes of dynamic modification of processes over the grid, in order to evolve and adapt long-term processes to the continuously changing grid environment. 7.",

        "Opera-G [3], al igual que WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de procesos similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y a los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona recuperación automática de la ejecución y un control limitado de la ejecución del proceso.",

Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso.

La computación en malla es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la <br>ejecución de procesos</br> en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de <br>ejecución de procesos</br>. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la <br>ejecución y programación de procesos</br> ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada.

Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas C.2.4 [Redes de Computadoras-Comunicación]: Sistemas Distribuidos-aplicaciones distribuidas Términos Generales Diseño, Rendimiento, Gestión, Algoritmos 1. La <br>computación en malla</br> es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de <br>computación en malla</br> propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la <br>computación en malla</br> y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2.

                "Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity manager.",
                "It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers.",
                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",
                "Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM Figure 3: Inter-group relationships connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group managers (see Figure 3).",

                "Each group manager exports coarse availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and also receives requests from other external services to furnish detailed availability information.",

                "PROCESS EXECUTION In the proposed grid architecture, a process is specified in XML, using controllers to determine control flow; referencing other processes and activities; and passing objects to their parameters in order to define data flow.",
                "After specified, the process is compiled in a set of classes, which represent specific process, activity and controller types.",
                "At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group.",
                "Also, the initial parameters must be passed to it, and then it can be started.",
                "The process coordinator carries out the process by executing the process elements included in its body sequentially.",
                "If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available.",
                "Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine.",
                "Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element.",
                "Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid.",
                "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",
                "Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers.",
                "Such procedure is followed recursively by all process coGM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Process PC Figure 4: FindPrimes process execution ordinators that execute subprocesses or controllers of a process.",
                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
                "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",
                "RELATED WORK There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing, aiming to provide interfaces, protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for Grid Computing 90 distributed resources in heterogeneous and autonomous networks.",

                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing.",

                "In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that allow the execution of structured processes in a widely distributed and hierarchical manner.",
                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
                "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
                "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",

                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",

                "If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available.",
                "Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine.",
                "Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element.",
                "Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid.",
                "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",

                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
                "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",

                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",

                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",

Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas C.2.4 [Redes de Computadoras-Comunicación]: Sistemas Distribuidos-<br>aplicaciones distribuidas</br> Términos Generales Diseño, Rendimiento, Gestión, Algoritmos 1. La computación en malla es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación en malla propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la computación en malla y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura de computación en malla es muy similar al especificado en el Lenguaje de Ejecución de Procesos de Negocio (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente síncronos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basándose en construcciones estructuradas, a diferencia de BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un problema específico. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso; los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso padre; y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar el orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que en los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar el orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos del proceso a través de parámetros. Son pasados por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Los datos externos pueden ser accedidos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales u objetos distribuidos. 2.1 Controladores Los controladores son estructuras de control utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controladores secuenciales son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los demás imitan estructuras equivalentes de lenguajes de programación estructurada. De manera similar, los tipos paralelos son: par, parswitch, parfor y parwhile. Extienden los respectivos contrapartes secuenciales para permitir la ejecución en paralelo de los elementos del proceso. Todos los tipos de controladores paralelos bifurcan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego esperan a que cada ejecución termine. De hecho, contienen una bifurcación y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controladores paralelos contienen una condición de salida, evaluada cada vez que finaliza la ejecución de un elemento, para determinar cuándo debe finalizar el controlador. El parfor y el parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambos tenedores se ejecutan mientras la condición de iteración sea verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, la cantidad de elementos de proceso que se ejecutarán simultáneamente. En comparación con los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controladores paralelos representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control de flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar bifurcaciones y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en dichos lenguajes. Ejemplo de Proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe un cierto rango de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de números primos contenidos en este rango. La computación completa se realiza mediante un proceso que utiliza un controlador paralelo para iniciar y despachar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, con el fin de encontrar números primos. La porción del documento XML que describe los tipos de proceso y actividad se muestra a continuación. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware para Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> En primer lugar, se define un tipo de proceso que encuentra números primos, llamado FindPrimes. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, un rango de enteros en el que se deben encontrar números primos, la cantidad de primos a devolver y la cantidad de actividades a ejecutar para realizar este trabajo. Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades en paralelo. Itera desde 0 hasta getNumActs() - 1, lo cual determina el número de actividades, iniciando una actividad en paralelo en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subrangos del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, inicia una actividad en paralelo que encuentra números primos en un subrango específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos recién encontrados y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de primos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrango. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en el que debe encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se deben encontrar en todo el proceso y, pasado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados. Entre sus marcadores de CODE, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un número primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de números primos, insertados en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, y sale si es verdadero. La ventaja de utilizar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y monitorización automáticas, así como la capacidad de instanciar y despachar elementos del proceso solo cuando haya suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, pueden ser fácilmente compuestos y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al Grupo Servidor Grupo Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Gerente de Grupo Servidor Proceso Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Coordinador de Procesos Trabajador Máquina Virtual Java RMI Administrador de Actividades Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura en diferentes máquinas sobre la red, permitiendo una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallos. La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para la especificación y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de grid altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y programar actividades y controladores, y ejecutar actividades. 3.1 Arquitectura de Infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, que preservan su autonomía administrativa. Generalmente, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en redes locales o grupos de servidores, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) [11], y una Biblioteca de Tiempo de Ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gestor de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gestor de actividades (AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más administradores de grupo, pero solo uno actúa como principal y los demás como réplicas. Ellos son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas del grupo. Además, los gerentes de grupo mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios de grupo para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos, y programar y despachar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución de procesos y datos, y también cargar la especificación de procesos, utilizan repositorios de grupo. Finalmente, en varios nodos de grupo hay un administrador de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos de grupo, e informar sobre la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad pendientes, que contienen actividades por ejecutar. 3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar una arquitectura de red real, la infraestructura debe incluir varias, potencialmente todas, las redes locales, como lo hace Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales están conectados a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes de grupo (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se encarga de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses punteadas), con el fin de registrar las máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad correspondiente. Además, los gerentes de grupo se comunican con los gerentes de grupo de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad general a los gerentes de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gestores de actividades, respectivamente. 4. EJECUCIÓN DEL PROCESO En la arquitectura de cuadrícula propuesta, un proceso se especifica en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control; haciendo referencia a otros procesos y actividades; y pasando objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos específicos de proceso, actividad y controlador. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de procesos. Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe ser instanciado haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de procesos de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben ser pasados a él, y luego puede ser iniciado. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo de forma secuencial. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador de procesos puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de procesos en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, se pasa a un gestor de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores del proceso solicitan al gerente del grupo local encontrar máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio, coordinador del proceso o gerente de actividad requeridos, para ejecutar un elemento del proceso. Entonces, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguna, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina gestora de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local; y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos) si no hay servidores de procesos o trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local. Siguiendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupo intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de forma recursiva por todos los procesos coGM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Proceso PC Figura 4: ejecución del proceso FindPrimes por coordinadores que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, dado que los procesos están estructurados por la anidación de elementos de proceso, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente de forma jerárquica a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula según la disponibilidad y la localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la ejecución en áreas extensas, que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la red; y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, ya que los elementos fuertemente dependientes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cerca de ellos. Además, admite un monitoreo y control sencillos, gracias a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos. Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso 4.2 Retomando el ejemplo mostrado en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un rango determinado de números. Para resolver este problema, se crean una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador parfor. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra números primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso ejecutándose sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia del proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de procesos disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador parfor. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad FindPrimes. Si hay algún Administrador de Actividades (AM) disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay un administrador de actividad disponible, entonces el controlador entra en un estado de espera hasta que un administrador de actividad esté disponible o sea creado. De manera paralela, cada vez que una actividad finaliza, su resultado se envía de vuelta al coordinador del proceso, quien lo registra en el controlador de parfor. Entonces, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se han iniciado hayan terminado, y finaliza. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finaliza el proceso. 5. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Existen varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen apoyar la computación en malla, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de recursos distribuidos ampliamente en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar interfaces y servicios para la red, se ha definido la Arquitectura de Servicios de Red Abierta (OGSA). Las arquitecturas de rejilla generalmente tienen servicios que gestionan los recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en los disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen las dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en el orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar recuperación automática, y mejores algoritmos de distribución y programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de procesos y entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de actividades y su ejecución distribuida en un entorno de grid. Opera-G [3], al igual que WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de procesos similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y a los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona recuperación automática de la ejecución y un control limitado de la ejecución del proceso. Las arquitecturas previamente mencionadas y otras que llevan a cabo procesos sobre la red tienen una coordinación centralizada. Para superar esta limitación, sistemas como SwinDew [13] propusieron una ejecución de procesos ampliamente distribuida, en la que cada nodo sabe dónde ejecutar la siguiente actividad o unirse a actividades en un entorno de pares. En el área específica de distribución y programación de actividades, enfatizada en este trabajo, GridFlow [5] es notable. Utiliza una programación de dos niveles: global y local. A nivel local, cuenta con servicios que predicen la utilización de recursos informáticos y la duración de la actividad. Basándose en esta información, GridFlow emplea una técnica similar a PERT que intenta prever la hora de inicio y duración de la ejecución de las actividades para programarlas mejor con los recursos disponibles. La arquitectura propuesta en este documento, que abarca un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte de ejecución, es ampliamente descentralizada, a diferencia de WebFlow y Opera-G, siendo más escalable y tolerante a fallos. Pero, al igual que este último, está diseñado para respaldar la recuperación de la ejecución. En comparación con SwinDew, la arquitectura propuesta contiene coordinadores de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, los cuales coordinan procesos o partes de ellos de manera diferente a SwinDew, donde cada nodo tiene una vista limitada del proceso: solo la actividad que comienza a continuación. Esto facilita la supervisión y el control de los procesos. Finalmente, la infraestructura de soporte interrumpe el proceso y sus subprocesos para la ejecución en red, permitiendo a un grupo requerir a otro grupo para la coordinación y ejecución de elementos del proceso en nombre del primero. Esto es diferente de GridFlow, que puede ejecutar un proceso en un máximo de dos niveles, teniendo el nivel global como el único responsable de programar subprocesos en otros grupos. Esto puede limitar el rendimiento general de los procesos y hacer que el sistema sea menos escalable. CONCLUSIÓN Y TRABAJO FUTURO La computación en malla es un campo de investigación emergente que tiene como objetivo promover la computación distribuida y paralela en la amplia red de área de heterogéneos y autónomos dominios administrativos de manera transparente, similar a lo que Internet hace con el intercambio de datos. Hay varios productos que admiten la ejecución de tareas independientes en una cuadrícula, pero solo unos pocos admiten la ejecución de procesos con tareas interdependientes. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento propone un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte que permiten la ejecución de procesos estructurados de manera ampliamente distribuida y jerárquica. Esta infraestructura de soporte proporciona distribución automática, estructurada y recursiva de elementos de proceso sobre grupos de máquinas disponibles; mejor uso de recursos, debido a su creación bajo demanda de elementos de proceso; monitoreo y control de procesos fácil, debido a su naturaleza estructurada; y comunicación localizada entre elementos de proceso fuertemente dependientes, que se colocan bajo el mismo controlador. Estas características contribuyen a una mejor escalabilidad, tolerancia a fallos y control para la ejecución de procesos en la red. Además, abre puertas para mejores algoritmos de programación, mecanismos de recuperación y también esquemas de modificación dinámica. El próximo trabajo será la implementación de un mecanismo de recuperación que utiliza la ejecución y el estado de los datos de los procesos y controladores para recuperar la ejecución del proceso. Después de eso, es deseable avanzar en el algoritmo de programación para prever el uso de máquinas en los mismos u otros grupos y anticipar el tiempo de inicio de los elementos del proceso, con el fin de utilizar esta información para preasignar recursos y, así, obtener un mejor rendimiento en la ejecución del proceso. Finalmente, es interesante investigar esquemas de modificación dinámica de procesos en la red, con el fin de evolucionar y adaptar procesos a largo plazo al entorno de la red en constante cambio. 7.

                "This research field aims to promote sharing of resources and provides breakthrough computing power over this wide network of virtual organizations in a seamless manner [8].",
                "Traditionally, as in Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10], there is a minimal infrastructure that provides data resource sharing, computational resource utilization management, and distributed execution.",
                "Specifically, considering distributed execution, most of the existing grid infrastructures supports execution of isolated tasks, but they do not consider their task interdependencies as in processes (workflows) [12].",
                "This deficiency restricts better scheduling algorithms, distributed execution coordination and automatic execution recovery.",
                "There are few proposed middleware infrastructures that support process execution over the grid.",
                "In general, they model processes by interconnecting their activities through control and data dependencies.",
                "Among them, WebFlow [1] emphasizes an architecture to construct distributed processes; Opera-G [3] provides execution recovering and steering, GridFlow [5] focuses on improved scheduling algorithms that take advantage of activity dependencies, and SwinDew [13] supports totally distributed execution on peer-to-peer networks.",
                "However, such infrastructures contain scheduling algorithms that are centralized by process [1, 3, 5], or completely distributed, but difficult to monitor and control [13].",
                "In order to address such constraints, this paper proposes a structured programming model for process description and a hierarchical process execution infrastructure.",
                "The programming model employs structured control flow to promote controlled and contextualized activity execution.",
                "Complementary, the support infrastructure, which executes a process specification, takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of a specified process in order to distribute and schedule strong dependent activities as a unit, allowing a better execution performance and fault-tolerance and providing localized communication.",
                "The programming model and the support infrastructure, named X avantes, are under implementation in order to show the feasibility of the proposed model and to demonstrate its two major advantages: to promote widely <br>distributed process</br> execution and scheduling, but in a controlled, structured and localized way.",

                "PROGRAMMING MODEL The programming model designed for the grid computing architecture is very similar to the specified to the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) [2].",
                "Both describe processes in XML [4] documents, but the former specifies processes strictly synchronous and structured, and has more constructs for structured parallel control.",
                "The rationale behind of its design is the possibility of hierarchically distribute the process control and coordination based on structured constructs, differently from BPEL, which does not allow hierarchical composition of processes.",
                "In the proposed programming model, a process is a set of interdependent activities arranged to solve a certain problem.",
                "In detail, a process is composed of activities, subprocesses, and controllers (see Figure 1).",
                "Activities represent simple tasks that are executed on behalf of a process; subprocesses are processes executed in the context of a parent process; and controllers are control elements used to specify the execution order of these activities and subprocesses.",
                "Like structured languages, controllers can be nested and then determine the execution order of other controllers.",
                "Data are exchanged among process elements through parameters.",
                "They are passed by value, in case of simple objects, or by reference, if they are remote objects shared among elements of the same controller or process.",
                "External data can be accessed through data sources, such as relational databases or distributed objects. 2.1 Controllers Controllers are structured control constructs used to define the control flow of processes.",
                "There are sequential and parallel controllers.",
                "The sequential controller types are: block, switch, for and while.",
                "The block controller is a simple sequential construct, and the others mimic equivalent structured programming language constructs.",
                "Similarly, the parallel types are: par, parswitch, parfor and parwhile.",
                "They extend the respective sequential counterparts to allow parallel execution of process elements.",
                "All parallel controller types fork the execution of one or more process elements, and then, wait for each execution to finish.",
                "Indeed, they contain a fork and a join of execution.",
                "Aiming to implement a conditional join, all parallel controller types contain an exit condition, evaluated all time that an element execution finishes, in order to determine when the controller must end.",

                "When compared to workflow languages, the parallel controller types represent structured versions of the workflow control constructors, because they can nest other controllers and also can express fixed and conditional forks and joins, present in such languages. 2.2 Process Example This section presents an example of a prime number search application that receives a certain range of integers and returns a set of primes contained in this range.",

                "The advantage of using controllers is the possibility of the support infrastructure determines the point of execution the process is in, allowing automatic recovery and monitoring, and also the capability of instantiating and dispatching process elements only when there are enough computing resources available, reducing unnecessary overhead.",
                "Besides, due to its structured nature, they can be easily composed and the support infrastructure can take advantage of this in order to distribute hierarchically the nested controllers to Group Server Group Java Virtual Machine RMI JDBC Group Manager Process Server Java Virtual Machine RMI JDBC Process Coordinator Worker Java Virtual Machine RMI Activity Manager Repository Figure 2: Infrastructure architecture different machines over the grid, allowing enhanced scalability and fault-tolerance. 3.",

                "It has services to monitor availability of resources in the grid, to interpret processes and schedule activities and controllers, and to execute activities. 3.1 Infrastructure Architecture The support infrastructure architecture is composed of groups of machines and data repositories, which preserves its administrative autonomy.",
                "Generally, localized machines and repositories, such as in local networks or clusters, form a group.",
                "Each machine in a group must have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) [11], and a Java Runtime Library, besides a combination of the following grid support services: group manager (GM), process coordinator (PC) and activity manager (AM).",
                "This combination determines what kind of group node it represents: a group server, a process server, or simply a worker (see Figure 2).",
                "In a group there are one or more group managers, but only one acts as primary and the others, as replicas.",
                "They are responsible to maintain availability information of group machines.",

                "To control process execution, there are one or more process coordinators per group.",
                "They are responsible to instantiate and execute processes and controllers, select resources, and schedule and dispatch activities to workers.",
                "In order to persist and recover process execution and data, and also load process specification, they use group repositories.",
                "Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity manager.",
                "It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers.",
                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",
                "Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM Figure 3: Inter-group relationships connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group managers (see Figure 3).",
                "Each group manager deals with requests of its group (represented by dashed ellipses), in order to register local machines and maintain correspondent availability.",
                "Additionally, group managers communicate to group managers of other groups.",
                "Each group manager exports coarse availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and also receives requests from other external services to furnish detailed availability information.",
                "In this way, if there are resources available in external groups, it is possible to send processes, controllers and activities to these groups in order to execute them in external process coordinators and activity managers, respectively. 4.",
                "PROCESS EXECUTION In the proposed grid architecture, a process is specified in XML, using controllers to determine control flow; referencing other processes and activities; and passing objects to their parameters in order to define data flow.",
                "After specified, the process is compiled in a set of classes, which represent specific process, activity and controller types.",
                "At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group.",
                "Also, the initial parameters must be passed to it, and then it can be started.",
                "The process coordinator carries out the process by executing the process elements included in its body sequentially.",
                "If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available.",
                "Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine.",
                "Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element.",
                "Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid.",
                "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",
                "Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers.",
                "Such procedure is followed recursively by all process coGM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Process PC Figure 4: FindPrimes process execution ordinators that execute subprocesses or controllers of a process.",
                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
                "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",
                "RELATED WORK There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing, aiming to provide interfaces, protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for Grid Computing 90 distributed resources in heterogeneous and autonomous networks.",
                "Among them, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10] are widely known.",
                "Aiming to standardize interfaces and services to grid, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) [7] has been defined.",
                "The grid architectures generally have services that manage computing resources and distribute the execution of independent tasks on available ones.",
                "However, emerging architectures maintain task dependencies and automatically execute tasks in a correct order.",
                "They take advantage of these dependencies to provide automatic recovery, and better distribution and scheduling algorithms.",
                "Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment.",
                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely <br>distributed process</br> execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely <br>distributed process</br> coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing.",
                "There are several products that support execution of independent tasks over grid, but only a few supports the execution of processes with interdependent tasks.",
                "In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that allow the execution of structured processes in a widely distributed and hierarchical manner.",
                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
                "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
                "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",
                "Finally, it is interesting to investigate schemes of dynamic modification of processes over the grid, in order to evolve and adapt long-term processes to the continuously changing grid environment. 7.",

Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas C.2.4 [Redes de Computadoras-Comunicación]: Sistemas Distribuidos-aplicaciones distribuidas Términos Generales Diseño, Rendimiento, Gestión, Algoritmos 1. La computación en malla es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación en malla propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la computación en malla y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura de computación en malla es muy similar al especificado en el Lenguaje de Ejecución de Procesos de Negocio (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente síncronos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basándose en construcciones estructuradas, a diferencia de BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un problema específico. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso; los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso padre; y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar el orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que en los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar el orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos del proceso a través de parámetros. Son pasados por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Los datos externos pueden ser accedidos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales u objetos distribuidos. 2.1 Controladores Los controladores son estructuras de control utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controladores secuenciales son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los demás imitan estructuras equivalentes de lenguajes de programación estructurada. De manera similar, los tipos paralelos son: par, parswitch, parfor y parwhile. Extienden los respectivos contrapartes secuenciales para permitir la ejecución en paralelo de los elementos del proceso. Todos los tipos de controladores paralelos bifurcan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego esperan a que cada ejecución termine. De hecho, contienen una bifurcación y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controladores paralelos contienen una condición de salida, evaluada cada vez que finaliza la ejecución de un elemento, para determinar cuándo debe finalizar el controlador. El parfor y el parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambos tenedores se ejecutan mientras la condición de iteración sea verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, la cantidad de elementos de proceso que se ejecutarán simultáneamente. En comparación con los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controladores paralelos representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control de flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar bifurcaciones y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en dichos lenguajes. Ejemplo de Proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe un cierto rango de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de números primos contenidos en este rango. La computación completa se realiza mediante un proceso que utiliza un controlador paralelo para iniciar y despachar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, con el fin de encontrar números primos. La porción del documento XML que describe los tipos de proceso y actividad se muestra a continuación. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware para Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> En primer lugar, se define un tipo de proceso que encuentra números primos, llamado FindPrimes. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, un rango de enteros en el que se deben encontrar números primos, la cantidad de primos a devolver y la cantidad de actividades a ejecutar para realizar este trabajo. Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades en paralelo. Itera desde 0 hasta getNumActs() - 1, lo cual determina el número de actividades, iniciando una actividad en paralelo en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subrangos del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, inicia una actividad en paralelo que encuentra números primos en un subrango específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos recién encontrados y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de primos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrango. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en el que debe encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se deben encontrar en todo el proceso y, pasado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados. Entre sus marcadores de CODE, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un número primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de números primos, insertados en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, y sale si es verdadero. La ventaja de utilizar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y monitorización automáticas, así como la capacidad de instanciar y despachar elementos del proceso solo cuando haya suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, pueden ser fácilmente compuestos y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al Grupo Servidor Grupo Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Gerente de Grupo Servidor Proceso Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Coordinador de Procesos Trabajador Máquina Virtual Java RMI Administrador de Actividades Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura en diferentes máquinas sobre la red, permitiendo una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallos. La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para la especificación y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de grid altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y programar actividades y controladores, y ejecutar actividades. 3.1 Arquitectura de Infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, que preservan su autonomía administrativa. Generalmente, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en redes locales o grupos de servidores, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) [11], y una Biblioteca de Tiempo de Ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gestor de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gestor de actividades (AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más administradores de grupo, pero solo uno actúa como principal y los demás como réplicas. Ellos son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas del grupo. Además, los gerentes de grupo mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios de grupo para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos, y programar y despachar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución de procesos y datos, y también cargar la especificación de procesos, utilizan repositorios de grupo. Finalmente, en varios nodos de grupo hay un administrador de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos de grupo, e informar sobre la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad pendientes, que contienen actividades por ejecutar. 3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar una arquitectura de red real, la infraestructura debe incluir varias, potencialmente todas, las redes locales, como lo hace Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales están conectados a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes de grupo (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se encarga de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses punteadas), con el fin de registrar las máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad correspondiente. Además, los gerentes de grupo se comunican con los gerentes de grupo de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad general a los gerentes de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gestores de actividades, respectivamente. 4. EJECUCIÓN DEL PROCESO En la arquitectura de cuadrícula propuesta, un proceso se especifica en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control; haciendo referencia a otros procesos y actividades; y pasando objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos específicos de proceso, actividad y controlador. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de procesos. Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe ser instanciado haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de procesos de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben ser pasados a él, y luego puede ser iniciado. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo de forma secuencial. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador de procesos puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de procesos en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, se pasa a un gestor de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores del proceso solicitan al gerente del grupo local encontrar máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio, coordinador del proceso o gerente de actividad requeridos, para ejecutar un elemento del proceso. Entonces, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguna, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina gestora de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local; y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos) si no hay servidores de procesos o trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local. Siguiendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupo intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de forma recursiva por todos los procesos coGM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Proceso PC Figura 4: ejecución del proceso FindPrimes por coordinadores que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, dado que los procesos están estructurados por la anidación de elementos de proceso, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente de forma jerárquica a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula según la disponibilidad y la localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la ejecución en áreas extensas, que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la red; y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, ya que los elementos fuertemente dependientes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cerca de ellos. Además, admite un monitoreo y control sencillos, gracias a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos. Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso 4.2 Retomando el ejemplo mostrado en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un rango determinado de números. Para resolver este problema, se crean una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador parfor. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra números primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso ejecutándose sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia del proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de procesos disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador parfor. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad FindPrimes. Si hay algún Administrador de Actividades (AM) disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay un administrador de actividad disponible, entonces el controlador entra en un estado de espera hasta que un administrador de actividad esté disponible o sea creado. De manera paralela, cada vez que una actividad finaliza, su resultado se envía de vuelta al coordinador del proceso, quien lo registra en el controlador de parfor. Entonces, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se han iniciado hayan terminado, y finaliza. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finaliza el proceso. 5. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Existen varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen apoyar la computación en malla, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de recursos distribuidos ampliamente en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar interfaces y servicios para la red, se ha definido la Arquitectura de Servicios de Red Abierta (OGSA). Las arquitecturas de rejilla generalmente tienen servicios que gestionan los recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en los disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen las dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en el orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar recuperación automática, y mejores algoritmos de distribución y programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de procesos y entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de actividades y su ejecución distribuida en un entorno de grid. Opera-G [3], al igual que WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de procesos similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y a los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona recuperación automática de la ejecución y un control limitado de la ejecución del proceso. Las arquitecturas previamente mencionadas y otras que llevan a cabo procesos sobre la red tienen una coordinación centralizada. Para superar esta limitación, sistemas como SwinDew [13] propusieron una ejecución de procesos ampliamente distribuida, en la que cada nodo sabe dónde ejecutar la siguiente actividad o unirse a actividades en un entorno de pares. En el área específica de distribución y programación de actividades, enfatizada en este trabajo, GridFlow [5] es notable. Utiliza una programación de dos niveles: global y local. A nivel local, cuenta con servicios que predicen la utilización de recursos informáticos y la duración de la actividad. Basándose en esta información, GridFlow emplea una técnica similar a PERT que intenta prever la hora de inicio y duración de la ejecución de las actividades para programarlas mejor con los recursos disponibles. La arquitectura propuesta en este documento, que abarca un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte de ejecución, es ampliamente descentralizada, a diferencia de WebFlow y Opera-G, siendo más escalable y tolerante a fallos. Pero, al igual que este último, está diseñado para respaldar la recuperación de la ejecución. En comparación con SwinDew, la arquitectura propuesta contiene coordinadores de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, los cuales coordinan procesos o partes de ellos de manera diferente a SwinDew, donde cada nodo tiene una vista limitada del proceso: solo la actividad que comienza a continuación. Esto facilita la supervisión y el control de los procesos. Finalmente, la infraestructura de soporte interrumpe el proceso y sus subprocesos para la ejecución en red, permitiendo a un grupo requerir a otro grupo para la coordinación y ejecución de elementos del proceso en nombre del primero. Esto es diferente de GridFlow, que puede ejecutar un proceso en un máximo de dos niveles, teniendo el nivel global como el único responsable de programar subprocesos en otros grupos. Esto puede limitar el rendimiento general de los procesos y hacer que el sistema sea menos escalable. CONCLUSIÓN Y TRABAJO FUTURO La computación en malla es un campo de investigación emergente que tiene como objetivo promover la computación distribuida y paralela en la amplia red de área de heterogéneos y autónomos dominios administrativos de manera transparente, similar a lo que Internet hace con el intercambio de datos. Hay varios productos que admiten la ejecución de tareas independientes en una cuadrícula, pero solo unos pocos admiten la ejecución de procesos con tareas interdependientes. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento propone un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte que permiten la ejecución de procesos estructurados de manera ampliamente distribuida y jerárquica. Esta infraestructura de soporte proporciona distribución automática, estructurada y recursiva de elementos de proceso sobre grupos de máquinas disponibles; mejor uso de recursos, debido a su creación bajo demanda de elementos de proceso; monitoreo y control de procesos fácil, debido a su naturaleza estructurada; y comunicación localizada entre elementos de proceso fuertemente dependientes, que se colocan bajo el mismo controlador. Estas características contribuyen a una mejor escalabilidad, tolerancia a fallos y control para la ejecución de procesos en la red. Además, abre puertas para mejores algoritmos de programación, mecanismos de recuperación y también esquemas de modificación dinámica. El próximo trabajo será la implementación de un mecanismo de recuperación que utiliza la ejecución y el estado de los datos de los procesos y controladores para recuperar la ejecución del proceso. Después de eso, es deseable avanzar en el algoritmo de programación para prever el uso de máquinas en los mismos u otros grupos y anticipar el tiempo de inicio de los elementos del proceso, con el fin de utilizar esta información para preasignar recursos y, así, obtener un mejor rendimiento en la ejecución del proceso. Finalmente, es interesante investigar esquemas de modificación dinámica de procesos en la red, con el fin de evolucionar y adaptar procesos a largo plazo al entorno de la red en constante cambio. 7.

                "There are few proposed middleware infrastructures that support process execution over the grid.",
                "In general, they model processes by interconnecting their activities through control and data dependencies.",
                "Among them, WebFlow [1] emphasizes an architecture to construct distributed processes; Opera-G [3] provides execution recovering and steering, GridFlow [5] focuses on improved scheduling algorithms that take advantage of activity dependencies, and SwinDew [13] supports totally distributed execution on peer-to-peer networks.",
                "However, such infrastructures contain scheduling algorithms that are centralized by process [1, 3, 5], or completely distributed, but difficult to monitor and control [13].",
                "In order to address such constraints, this paper proposes a structured programming model for process description and a hierarchical process execution infrastructure.",
                "The programming model employs structured control flow to promote controlled and contextualized activity execution.",
                "Complementary, the support infrastructure, which executes a process specification, takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of a specified process in order to distribute and schedule strong dependent activities as a unit, allowing a better execution performance and fault-tolerance and providing localized communication.",

                "The rationale behind of its design is the possibility of hierarchically distribute the process control and coordination based on structured constructs, differently from BPEL, which does not allow hierarchical composition of processes.",
                "In the proposed programming model, a process is a set of interdependent activities arranged to solve a certain problem.",
                "In detail, a process is composed of activities, subprocesses, and controllers (see Figure 1).",
                "Activities represent simple tasks that are executed on behalf of a process; subprocesses are processes executed in the context of a parent process; and controllers are control elements used to specify the execution order of these activities and subprocesses.",

                "Data are exchanged among process elements through parameters.",
                "They are passed by value, in case of simple objects, or by reference, if they are remote objects shared among elements of the same controller or process.",
                "External data can be accessed through data sources, such as relational databases or distributed objects. 2.1 Controllers Controllers are structured control constructs used to define the control flow of processes.",
                "There are sequential and parallel controllers.",
                "The sequential controller types are: block, switch, for and while.",
                "The block controller is a simple sequential construct, and the others mimic equivalent structured programming language constructs.",
                "Similarly, the parallel types are: par, parswitch, parfor and parwhile.",

                "Generally, localized machines and repositories, such as in local networks or clusters, form a group.",
                "Each machine in a group must have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) [11], and a Java Runtime Library, besides a combination of the following grid support services: group manager (GM), process coordinator (PC) and activity manager (AM).",

                "In order to persist and recover process execution and data, and also load process specification, they use group repositories.",
                "Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity manager.",
                "It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers.",
                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",
                "Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM Figure 3: Inter-group relationships connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group managers (see Figure 3).",
                "Each group manager deals with requests of its group (represented by dashed ellipses), in order to register local machines and maintain correspondent availability.",
                "Additionally, group managers communicate to group managers of other groups.",
                "Each group manager exports coarse availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and also receives requests from other external services to furnish detailed availability information.",
                "In this way, if there are resources available in external groups, it is possible to send processes, controllers and activities to these groups in order to execute them in external process coordinators and activity managers, respectively. 4.",
                "PROCESS EXECUTION In the proposed grid architecture, a process is specified in XML, using controllers to determine control flow; referencing other processes and activities; and passing objects to their parameters in order to define data flow.",
                "After specified, the process is compiled in a set of classes, which represent specific process, activity and controller types.",
                "At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group.",
                "Also, the initial parameters must be passed to it, and then it can be started.",
                "The process coordinator carries out the process by executing the process elements included in its body sequentially.",
                "If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available.",
                "Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine.",
                "Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element.",
                "Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid.",
                "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",
                "Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers.",
                "Such procedure is followed recursively by all process coGM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Process PC Figure 4: FindPrimes process execution ordinators that execute subprocesses or controllers of a process.",
                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
                "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",
                "RELATED WORK There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing, aiming to provide interfaces, protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for Grid Computing 90 distributed resources in heterogeneous and autonomous networks.",

                "Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment.",
                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing.",

                "In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that allow the execution of structured processes in a widely distributed and hierarchical manner.",
                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
                "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
                "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",

                "Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity manager.",
                "It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers.",
                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",
                "Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM Figure 3: Inter-group relationships connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group managers (see Figure 3).",
                "Each group manager deals with requests of its group (represented by dashed ellipses), in order to register local machines and maintain correspondent availability.",
                "Additionally, group managers communicate to group managers of other groups.",
                "Each group manager exports coarse availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and also receives requests from other external services to furnish detailed availability information.",

                "PROCESS EXECUTION In the proposed grid architecture, a process is specified in XML, using controllers to determine control flow; referencing other processes and activities; and passing objects to their parameters in order to define data flow.",
                "After specified, the process is compiled in a set of classes, which represent specific process, activity and controller types.",
                "At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group.",
                "Also, the initial parameters must be passed to it, and then it can be started.",
                "The process coordinator carries out the process by executing the process elements included in its body sequentially.",
                "If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available.",
                "Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine.",
                "Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element.",
                "Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid.",
                "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",
                "Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers.",
                "Such procedure is followed recursively by all process coGM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Process PC Figure 4: FindPrimes process execution ordinators that execute subprocesses or controllers of a process.",
                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
                "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",

                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",

                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
                "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
                "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",

Buzato Instituto de Computación Universidad Estatal de Campinas Campinas, Brasil buzato@ic.unicamp.br RESUMEN Grid es una infraestructura emergente utilizada para compartir recursos entre organizaciones virtuales de manera transparente y para proporcionar una potencia informática revolucionaria a bajo costo. Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas C.2.4 [Redes de Computadoras-Comunicación]: Sistemas Distribuidos-aplicaciones distribuidas Términos Generales Diseño, Rendimiento, Gestión, Algoritmos 1. La computación en malla es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la <br>ejecución distribuida</br>. Específicamente, considerando la <br>ejecución distribuida</br>, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de <br>ejecución distribuida</br> y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una <br>ejecución totalmente distribuida</br> en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación en malla propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la computación en malla y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura de computación en malla es muy similar al especificado en el Lenguaje de Ejecución de Procesos de Negocio (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente síncronos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basándose en construcciones estructuradas, a diferencia de BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un problema específico. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso; los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso padre; y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar el orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que en los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar el orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos del proceso a través de parámetros. Son pasados por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Los datos externos pueden ser accedidos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales u objetos distribuidos. 2.1 Controladores Los controladores son estructuras de control utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controladores secuenciales son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los demás imitan estructuras equivalentes de lenguajes de programación estructurada. De manera similar, los tipos paralelos son: par, parswitch, parfor y parwhile. Extienden los respectivos contrapartes secuenciales para permitir la ejecución en paralelo de los elementos del proceso. Todos los tipos de controladores paralelos bifurcan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego esperan a que cada ejecución termine. De hecho, contienen una bifurcación y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controladores paralelos contienen una condición de salida, evaluada cada vez que finaliza la ejecución de un elemento, para determinar cuándo debe finalizar el controlador. El parfor y el parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambos tenedores se ejecutan mientras la condición de iteración sea verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, la cantidad de elementos de proceso que se ejecutarán simultáneamente. En comparación con los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controladores paralelos representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control de flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar bifurcaciones y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en dichos lenguajes. Ejemplo de Proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe un cierto rango de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de números primos contenidos en este rango. La computación completa se realiza mediante un proceso que utiliza un controlador paralelo para iniciar y despachar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, con el fin de encontrar números primos. La porción del documento XML que describe los tipos de proceso y actividad se muestra a continuación. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware para Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> En primer lugar, se define un tipo de proceso que encuentra números primos, llamado FindPrimes. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, un rango de enteros en el que se deben encontrar números primos, la cantidad de primos a devolver y la cantidad de actividades a ejecutar para realizar este trabajo. Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades en paralelo. Itera desde 0 hasta getNumActs() - 1, lo cual determina el número de actividades, iniciando una actividad en paralelo en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subrangos del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, inicia una actividad en paralelo que encuentra números primos en un subrango específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos recién encontrados y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de primos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrango. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en el que debe encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se deben encontrar en todo el proceso y, pasado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados. Entre sus marcadores de CODE, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un número primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de números primos, insertados en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, y sale si es verdadero. La ventaja de utilizar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y monitorización automáticas, así como la capacidad de instanciar y despachar elementos del proceso solo cuando haya suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, pueden ser fácilmente compuestos y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al Grupo Servidor Grupo Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Gerente de Grupo Servidor Proceso Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Coordinador de Procesos Trabajador Máquina Virtual Java RMI Administrador de Actividades Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura en diferentes máquinas sobre la red, permitiendo una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallos. La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para la especificación y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de grid altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y programar actividades y controladores, y ejecutar actividades. 3.1 Arquitectura de Infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, que preservan su autonomía administrativa. Generalmente, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en redes locales o grupos de servidores, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) [11], y una Biblioteca de Tiempo de Ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gestor de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gestor de actividades (AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más administradores de grupo, pero solo uno actúa como principal y los demás como réplicas. Ellos son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas del grupo. Además, los gerentes de grupo mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios de grupo para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos, y programar y despachar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución de procesos y datos, y también cargar la especificación de procesos, utilizan repositorios de grupo. Finalmente, en varios nodos de grupo hay un administrador de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos de grupo, e informar sobre la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad pendientes, que contienen actividades por ejecutar. 3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar una arquitectura de red real, la infraestructura debe incluir varias, potencialmente todas, las redes locales, como lo hace Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales están conectados a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes de grupo (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se encarga de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses punteadas), con el fin de registrar las máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad correspondiente. Además, los gerentes de grupo se comunican con los gerentes de grupo de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad general a los gerentes de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gestores de actividades, respectivamente. 4. EJECUCIÓN DEL PROCESO En la arquitectura de cuadrícula propuesta, un proceso se especifica en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control; haciendo referencia a otros procesos y actividades; y pasando objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos específicos de proceso, actividad y controlador. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de procesos. Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe ser instanciado haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de procesos de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben ser pasados a él, y luego puede ser iniciado. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo de forma secuencial. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador de procesos puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de procesos en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, se pasa a un gestor de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores del proceso solicitan al gerente del grupo local encontrar máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio, coordinador del proceso o gerente de actividad requeridos, para ejecutar un elemento del proceso. Entonces, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguna, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina gestora de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local; y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos) si no hay servidores de procesos o trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local. Siguiendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupo intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de forma recursiva por todos los procesos coGM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Proceso PC Figura 4: ejecución del proceso FindPrimes por coordinadores que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, dado que los procesos están estructurados por la anidación de elementos de proceso, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente de forma jerárquica a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula según la disponibilidad y la localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la ejecución en áreas extensas, que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la red; y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, ya que los elementos fuertemente dependientes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cerca de ellos. Además, admite un monitoreo y control sencillos, gracias a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos. Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso 4.2 Retomando el ejemplo mostrado en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un rango determinado de números. Para resolver este problema, se crean una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador parfor. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra números primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso ejecutándose sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia del proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de procesos disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador parfor. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad FindPrimes. Si hay algún Administrador de Actividades (AM) disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay un administrador de actividad disponible, entonces el controlador entra en un estado de espera hasta que un administrador de actividad esté disponible o sea creado. De manera paralela, cada vez que una actividad finaliza, su resultado se envía de vuelta al coordinador del proceso, quien lo registra en el controlador de parfor. Entonces, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se han iniciado hayan terminado, y finaliza. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finaliza el proceso. 5. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Existen varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen apoyar la computación en malla, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de recursos distribuidos ampliamente en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar interfaces y servicios para la red, se ha definido la Arquitectura de Servicios de Red Abierta (OGSA). Las arquitecturas de rejilla generalmente tienen servicios que gestionan los recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en los disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen las dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en el orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar recuperación automática, y mejores algoritmos de distribución y programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de procesos y entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de actividades y su <br>ejecución distribuida</br> en un entorno de grid.

                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",

                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
                "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",

                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",

                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",

Buzato Instituto de Computación Universidad Estatal de Campinas Campinas, Brasil buzato@ic.unicamp.br RESUMEN Grid es una infraestructura emergente utilizada para compartir recursos entre organizaciones virtuales de manera transparente y para proporcionar una potencia informática revolucionaria a bajo costo. Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas C.2.4 [Redes de Computadoras-Comunicación]: Sistemas Distribuidos-aplicaciones distribuidas Términos Generales Diseño, Rendimiento, Gestión, Algoritmos 1. La computación en malla es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación en malla propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la computación en malla y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura de computación en malla es muy similar al especificado en el Lenguaje de Ejecución de Procesos de Negocio (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente síncronos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basándose en construcciones estructuradas, a diferencia de BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un problema específico. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso; los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso padre; y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar el orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que en los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar el orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos del proceso a través de parámetros. Son pasados por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Los datos externos pueden ser accedidos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales u objetos distribuidos. 2.1 Controladores Los controladores son estructuras de control utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controladores secuenciales son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los demás imitan estructuras equivalentes de lenguajes de programación estructurada. De manera similar, los tipos paralelos son: par, parswitch, parfor y parwhile. Extienden los respectivos contrapartes secuenciales para permitir la ejecución en paralelo de los elementos del proceso. Todos los tipos de controladores paralelos bifurcan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego esperan a que cada ejecución termine. De hecho, contienen una bifurcación y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controladores paralelos contienen una condición de salida, evaluada cada vez que finaliza la ejecución de un elemento, para determinar cuándo debe finalizar el controlador. El parfor y el parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambos tenedores se ejecutan mientras la condición de iteración sea verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, la cantidad de elementos de proceso que se ejecutarán simultáneamente. En comparación con los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controladores paralelos representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control de flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar bifurcaciones y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en dichos lenguajes. Ejemplo de Proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe un cierto rango de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de números primos contenidos en este rango. La computación completa se realiza mediante un proceso que utiliza un controlador paralelo para iniciar y despachar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, con el fin de encontrar números primos. La porción del documento XML que describe los tipos de proceso y actividad se muestra a continuación. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware para Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> En primer lugar, se define un tipo de proceso que encuentra números primos, llamado FindPrimes. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, un rango de enteros en el que se deben encontrar números primos, la cantidad de primos a devolver y la cantidad de actividades a ejecutar para realizar este trabajo. Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades en paralelo. Itera desde 0 hasta getNumActs() - 1, lo cual determina el número de actividades, iniciando una actividad en paralelo en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subrangos del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, inicia una actividad en paralelo que encuentra números primos en un subrango específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos recién encontrados y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de primos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrango. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en el que debe encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se deben encontrar en todo el proceso y, pasado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados. Entre sus marcadores de CODE, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un número primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de números primos, insertados en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, y sale si es verdadero. La ventaja de utilizar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y monitorización automáticas, así como la capacidad de instanciar y despachar elementos del proceso solo cuando haya suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, pueden ser fácilmente compuestos y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al Grupo Servidor Grupo Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Gerente de Grupo Servidor Proceso Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Coordinador de Procesos Trabajador Máquina Virtual Java RMI Administrador de Actividades Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura en diferentes máquinas sobre la red, permitiendo una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallos. La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para la especificación y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de grid altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y programar actividades y controladores, y ejecutar actividades. 3.1 Arquitectura de Infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, que preservan su autonomía administrativa. Generalmente, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en redes locales o grupos de servidores, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) [11], y una Biblioteca de Tiempo de Ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gestor de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gestor de actividades (AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más administradores de grupo, pero solo uno actúa como principal y los demás como réplicas. Ellos son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas del grupo. Además, los gerentes de grupo mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios de grupo para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos, y programar y despachar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución de procesos y datos, y también cargar la especificación de procesos, utilizan repositorios de grupo. Finalmente, en varios nodos de grupo hay un administrador de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos de grupo, e informar sobre la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad pendientes, que contienen actividades por ejecutar. 3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar una arquitectura de red real, la infraestructura debe incluir varias, potencialmente todas, las redes locales, como lo hace Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales están conectados a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes de grupo (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se encarga de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses punteadas), con el fin de registrar las máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad correspondiente. Además, los gerentes de grupo se comunican con los gerentes de grupo de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad general a los gerentes de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gestores de actividades, respectivamente. 4. EJECUCIÓN DEL PROCESO En la arquitectura de cuadrícula propuesta, un proceso se especifica en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control; haciendo referencia a otros procesos y actividades; y pasando objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos específicos de proceso, actividad y controlador. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de procesos. Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe ser instanciado haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de procesos de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben ser pasados a él, y luego puede ser iniciado. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo de forma secuencial. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador de procesos puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de procesos en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, se pasa a un gestor de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores del proceso solicitan al gerente del grupo local encontrar máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio, coordinador del proceso o gerente de actividad requeridos, para ejecutar un elemento del proceso. Entonces, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguna, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina gestora de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local; y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos) si no hay servidores de procesos o trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local. Siguiendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupo intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de forma recursiva por todos los procesos coGM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Proceso PC Figura 4: ejecución del proceso FindPrimes por coordinadores que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, dado que los procesos están estructurados por la anidación de elementos de proceso, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente de forma jerárquica a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula según la disponibilidad y la localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la ejecución en áreas extensas, que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la red; y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, ya que los elementos fuertemente dependientes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cerca de ellos. Además, admite un monitoreo y control sencillos, gracias a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos. Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso 4.2 Retomando el ejemplo mostrado en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un rango determinado de números. Para resolver este problema, se crean una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador parfor. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra números primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso ejecutándose sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia del proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de procesos disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador parfor. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad FindPrimes. Si hay algún Administrador de Actividades (AM) disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay un administrador de actividad disponible, entonces el controlador entra en un estado de espera hasta que un administrador de actividad esté disponible o sea creado. De manera paralela, cada vez que una actividad finaliza, su resultado se envía de vuelta al coordinador del proceso, quien lo registra en el controlador de parfor. Entonces, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se han iniciado hayan terminado, y finaliza. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finaliza el proceso. 5. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Existen varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen apoyar la computación en malla, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de recursos distribuidos ampliamente en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar interfaces y servicios para la red, se ha definido la Arquitectura de Servicios de Red Abierta (OGSA). Las arquitecturas de rejilla generalmente tienen servicios que gestionan los recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en los disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen las dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en el orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar recuperación automática, y mejores algoritmos de distribución y programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de procesos y entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de actividades y su ejecución distribuida en un entorno de grid. Opera-G [3], al igual que WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de procesos similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y a los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona recuperación automática de la ejecución y un control limitado de la ejecución del proceso. Las arquitecturas previamente mencionadas y otras que llevan a cabo procesos sobre la red tienen una coordinación centralizada. Para superar esta limitación, sistemas como SwinDew [13] propusieron una ejecución de procesos ampliamente distribuida, en la que cada nodo sabe dónde ejecutar la siguiente actividad o unirse a actividades en un entorno de pares. En el área específica de distribución y programación de actividades, enfatizada en este trabajo, GridFlow [5] es notable. Utiliza una programación de dos niveles: global y local. A nivel local, cuenta con servicios que predicen la utilización de recursos informáticos y la duración de la actividad. Basándose en esta información, GridFlow emplea una técnica similar a PERT que intenta prever la hora de inicio y duración de la ejecución de las actividades para programarlas mejor con los recursos disponibles. La arquitectura propuesta en este documento, que abarca un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte de ejecución, es ampliamente descentralizada, a diferencia de WebFlow y Opera-G, siendo más escalable y tolerante a fallos. Pero, al igual que este último, está diseñado para respaldar la recuperación de la ejecución. En comparación con SwinDew, la arquitectura propuesta contiene coordinadores de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, los cuales coordinan procesos o partes de ellos de manera diferente a SwinDew, donde cada nodo tiene una vista limitada del proceso: solo la actividad que comienza a continuación. Esto facilita la supervisión y el control de los procesos. Finalmente, la infraestructura de soporte interrumpe el proceso y sus subprocesos para la ejecución en red, permitiendo a un grupo requerir a otro grupo para la coordinación y ejecución de elementos del proceso en nombre del primero. Esto es diferente de GridFlow, que puede ejecutar un proceso en un máximo de dos niveles, teniendo el nivel global como el único responsable de programar subprocesos en otros grupos. Esto puede limitar el rendimiento general de los procesos y hacer que el sistema sea menos escalable. CONCLUSIÓN Y TRABAJO FUTURO La computación en malla es un campo de investigación emergente que tiene como objetivo promover la computación distribuida y paralela en la amplia red de área de heterogéneos y autónomos dominios administrativos de manera transparente, similar a lo que Internet hace con el intercambio de datos. Hay varios productos que admiten la ejecución de tareas independientes en una cuadrícula, pero solo unos pocos admiten la ejecución de procesos con tareas interdependientes. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento propone un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte que permiten la ejecución de procesos estructurados de manera ampliamente distribuida y jerárquica. Esta infraestructura de soporte proporciona distribución automática, estructurada y recursiva de elementos de proceso sobre grupos de máquinas disponibles; mejor uso de recursos, debido a su creación bajo demanda de elementos de proceso; monitoreo y control de procesos fácil, debido a su naturaleza estructurada; y comunicación localizada entre elementos de proceso fuertemente dependientes, que se colocan bajo el mismo controlador. Estas características contribuyen a una mejor escalabilidad, tolerancia a fallos y control para la ejecución de procesos en la red. Además, abre puertas para mejores algoritmos de programación, mecanismos de recuperación y también esquemas de modificación dinámica. El próximo trabajo será la implementación de un mecanismo de recuperación que utiliza la ejecución y el estado de los datos de los procesos y controladores para recuperar la ejecución del proceso. Después de eso, es deseable avanzar en el algoritmo de programación para prever el uso de máquinas en los mismos u otros grupos y anticipar el tiempo de inicio de los elementos del proceso, con el fin de utilizar esta información para preasignar recursos y, así, obtener un mejor rendimiento en la ejecución del proceso. Finalmente, es interesante investigar esquemas de modificación dinámica de procesos en la red, con el fin de evolucionar y adaptar procesos a largo plazo al entorno de la red en constante cambio. 7.

Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas C.2.4 [Redes de Computadoras-Comunicación]: Sistemas Distribuidos-aplicaciones distribuidas Términos Generales Diseño, Rendimiento, Gestión, Algoritmos 1. La computación en malla es un modelo para la <br>computación distribuida y paralela</br> de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación en malla propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la computación en malla y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura de computación en malla es muy similar al especificado en el Lenguaje de Ejecución de Procesos de Negocio (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente síncronos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basándose en construcciones estructuradas, a diferencia de BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un problema específico. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso; los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso padre; y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar el orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que en los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar el orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos del proceso a través de parámetros. Son pasados por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Los datos externos pueden ser accedidos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales u objetos distribuidos. 2.1 Controladores Los controladores son estructuras de control utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controladores secuenciales son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los demás imitan estructuras equivalentes de lenguajes de programación estructurada. De manera similar, los tipos paralelos son: par, parswitch, parfor y parwhile. Extienden los respectivos contrapartes secuenciales para permitir la ejecución en paralelo de los elementos del proceso. Todos los tipos de controladores paralelos bifurcan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego esperan a que cada ejecución termine. De hecho, contienen una bifurcación y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controladores paralelos contienen una condición de salida, evaluada cada vez que finaliza la ejecución de un elemento, para determinar cuándo debe finalizar el controlador. El parfor y el parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambos tenedores se ejecutan mientras la condición de iteración sea verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, la cantidad de elementos de proceso que se ejecutarán simultáneamente. En comparación con los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controladores paralelos representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control de flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar bifurcaciones y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en dichos lenguajes. Ejemplo de Proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe un cierto rango de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de números primos contenidos en este rango. La computación completa se realiza mediante un proceso que utiliza un controlador paralelo para iniciar y despachar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, con el fin de encontrar números primos. La porción del documento XML que describe los tipos de proceso y actividad se muestra a continuación. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware para Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> En primer lugar, se define un tipo de proceso que encuentra números primos, llamado FindPrimes. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, un rango de enteros en el que se deben encontrar números primos, la cantidad de primos a devolver y la cantidad de actividades a ejecutar para realizar este trabajo. Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades en paralelo. Itera desde 0 hasta getNumActs() - 1, lo cual determina el número de actividades, iniciando una actividad en paralelo en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subrangos del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, inicia una actividad en paralelo que encuentra números primos en un subrango específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos recién encontrados y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de primos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrango. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en el que debe encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se deben encontrar en todo el proceso y, pasado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados. Entre sus marcadores de CODE, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un número primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de números primos, insertados en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, y sale si es verdadero. La ventaja de utilizar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y monitorización automáticas, así como la capacidad de instanciar y despachar elementos del proceso solo cuando haya suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, pueden ser fácilmente compuestos y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al Grupo Servidor Grupo Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Gerente de Grupo Servidor Proceso Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Coordinador de Procesos Trabajador Máquina Virtual Java RMI Administrador de Actividades Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura en diferentes máquinas sobre la red, permitiendo una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallos. La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para la especificación y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de grid altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y programar actividades y controladores, y ejecutar actividades. 3.1 Arquitectura de Infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, que preservan su autonomía administrativa. Generalmente, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en redes locales o grupos de servidores, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) [11], y una Biblioteca de Tiempo de Ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gestor de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gestor de actividades (AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más administradores de grupo, pero solo uno actúa como principal y los demás como réplicas. Ellos son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas del grupo. Además, los gerentes de grupo mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios de grupo para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos, y programar y despachar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución de procesos y datos, y también cargar la especificación de procesos, utilizan repositorios de grupo. Finalmente, en varios nodos de grupo hay un administrador de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos de grupo, e informar sobre la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad pendientes, que contienen actividades por ejecutar. 3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar una arquitectura de red real, la infraestructura debe incluir varias, potencialmente todas, las redes locales, como lo hace Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales están conectados a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes de grupo (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se encarga de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses punteadas), con el fin de registrar las máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad correspondiente. Además, los gerentes de grupo se comunican con los gerentes de grupo de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad general a los gerentes de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gestores de actividades, respectivamente. 4. EJECUCIÓN DEL PROCESO En la arquitectura de cuadrícula propuesta, un proceso se especifica en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control; haciendo referencia a otros procesos y actividades; y pasando objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos específicos de proceso, actividad y controlador. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de procesos. Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe ser instanciado haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de procesos de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben ser pasados a él, y luego puede ser iniciado. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo de forma secuencial. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador de procesos puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de procesos en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, se pasa a un gestor de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores del proceso solicitan al gerente del grupo local encontrar máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio, coordinador del proceso o gerente de actividad requeridos, para ejecutar un elemento del proceso. Entonces, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguna, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina gestora de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local; y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos) si no hay servidores de procesos o trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local. Siguiendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupo intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de forma recursiva por todos los procesos coGM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Proceso PC Figura 4: ejecución del proceso FindPrimes por coordinadores que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, dado que los procesos están estructurados por la anidación de elementos de proceso, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente de forma jerárquica a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula según la disponibilidad y la localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la ejecución en áreas extensas, que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la red; y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, ya que los elementos fuertemente dependientes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cerca de ellos. Además, admite un monitoreo y control sencillos, gracias a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos. Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso 4.2 Retomando el ejemplo mostrado en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un rango determinado de números. Para resolver este problema, se crean una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador parfor. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra números primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso ejecutándose sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia del proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de procesos disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador parfor. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad FindPrimes. Si hay algún Administrador de Actividades (AM) disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay un administrador de actividad disponible, entonces el controlador entra en un estado de espera hasta que un administrador de actividad esté disponible o sea creado. De manera paralela, cada vez que una actividad finaliza, su resultado se envía de vuelta al coordinador del proceso, quien lo registra en el controlador de parfor. Entonces, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se han iniciado hayan terminado, y finaliza. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finaliza el proceso. 5. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Existen varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen apoyar la computación en malla, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de recursos distribuidos ampliamente en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar interfaces y servicios para la red, se ha definido la Arquitectura de Servicios de Red Abierta (OGSA). Las arquitecturas de rejilla generalmente tienen servicios que gestionan los recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en los disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen las dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en el orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar recuperación automática, y mejores algoritmos de distribución y programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de procesos y entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de actividades y su ejecución distribuida en un entorno de grid. Opera-G [3], al igual que WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de procesos similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y a los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona recuperación automática de la ejecución y un control limitado de la ejecución del proceso. Las arquitecturas previamente mencionadas y otras que llevan a cabo procesos sobre la red tienen una coordinación centralizada. Para superar esta limitación, sistemas como SwinDew [13] propusieron una ejecución de procesos ampliamente distribuida, en la que cada nodo sabe dónde ejecutar la siguiente actividad o unirse a actividades en un entorno de pares. En el área específica de distribución y programación de actividades, enfatizada en este trabajo, GridFlow [5] es notable. Utiliza una programación de dos niveles: global y local. A nivel local, cuenta con servicios que predicen la utilización de recursos informáticos y la duración de la actividad. Basándose en esta información, GridFlow emplea una técnica similar a PERT que intenta prever la hora de inicio y duración de la ejecución de las actividades para programarlas mejor con los recursos disponibles. La arquitectura propuesta en este documento, que abarca un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte de ejecución, es ampliamente descentralizada, a diferencia de WebFlow y Opera-G, siendo más escalable y tolerante a fallos. Pero, al igual que este último, está diseñado para respaldar la recuperación de la ejecución. En comparación con SwinDew, la arquitectura propuesta contiene coordinadores de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, los cuales coordinan procesos o partes de ellos de manera diferente a SwinDew, donde cada nodo tiene una vista limitada del proceso: solo la actividad que comienza a continuación. Esto facilita la supervisión y el control de los procesos. Finalmente, la infraestructura de soporte interrumpe el proceso y sus subprocesos para la ejecución en red, permitiendo a un grupo requerir a otro grupo para la coordinación y ejecución de elementos del proceso en nombre del primero. Esto es diferente de GridFlow, que puede ejecutar un proceso en un máximo de dos niveles, teniendo el nivel global como el único responsable de programar subprocesos en otros grupos. Esto puede limitar el rendimiento general de los procesos y hacer que el sistema sea menos escalable. CONCLUSIÓN Y TRABAJO FUTURO La computación en malla es un campo de investigación emergente que tiene como objetivo promover la <br>computación distribuida y paralela</br> en la amplia red de área de heterogéneos y autónomos dominios administrativos de manera transparente, similar a lo que Internet hace con el intercambio de datos. Hay varios productos que admiten la ejecución de tareas independientes en una cuadrícula, pero solo unos pocos admiten la ejecución de procesos con tareas interdependientes. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento propone un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte que permiten la ejecución de procesos estructurados de manera ampliamente distribuida y jerárquica. Esta infraestructura de soporte proporciona distribución automática, estructurada y recursiva de elementos de proceso sobre grupos de máquinas disponibles; mejor uso de recursos, debido a su creación bajo demanda de elementos de proceso; monitoreo y control de procesos fácil, debido a su naturaleza estructurada; y comunicación localizada entre elementos de proceso fuertemente dependientes, que se colocan bajo el mismo controlador. Estas características contribuyen a una mejor escalabilidad, tolerancia a fallos y control para la ejecución de procesos en la red. Además, abre puertas para mejores algoritmos de programación, mecanismos de recuperación y también esquemas de modificación dinámica. El próximo trabajo será la implementación de un mecanismo de recuperación que utiliza la ejecución y el estado de los datos de los procesos y controladores para recuperar la ejecución del proceso. Después de eso, es deseable avanzar en el algoritmo de programación para prever el uso de máquinas en los mismos u otros grupos y anticipar el tiempo de inicio de los elementos del proceso, con el fin de utilizar esta información para preasignar recursos y, así, obtener un mejor rendimiento en la ejecución del proceso. Finalmente, es interesante investigar esquemas de modificación dinámica de procesos en la red, con el fin de evolucionar y adaptar procesos a largo plazo al entorno de la red en constante cambio. 7.

Buzato Instituto de Computación Universidad Estatal de Campinas Campinas, Brasil buzato@ic.unicamp.br RESUMEN Grid es una infraestructura emergente utilizada para compartir recursos entre organizaciones virtuales de manera transparente y para proporcionar una potencia informática revolucionaria a bajo costo. Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas C.2.4 [Redes de Computadoras-Comunicación]: Sistemas Distribuidos-aplicaciones distribuidas Términos Generales Diseño, Rendimiento, Gestión, Algoritmos 1. La computación en malla es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación en malla propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la computación en malla y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura de computación en malla es muy similar al especificado en el Lenguaje de Ejecución de Procesos de Negocio (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente síncronos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basándose en construcciones estructuradas, a diferencia de BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un problema específico. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso; los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso padre; y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar el orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que en los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar el orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos del proceso a través de parámetros. Son pasados por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Los datos externos pueden ser accedidos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales u objetos distribuidos. 2.1 Controladores Los controladores son estructuras de control utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controladores secuenciales son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los demás imitan estructuras equivalentes de lenguajes de programación estructurada. De manera similar, los tipos paralelos son: par, parswitch, parfor y parwhile. Extienden los respectivos contrapartes secuenciales para permitir la <br>ejecución en paralelo</br> de los elementos del proceso. Todos los tipos de controladores paralelos bifurcan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego esperan a que cada ejecución termine. De hecho, contienen una bifurcación y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controladores paralelos contienen una condición de salida, evaluada cada vez que finaliza la ejecución de un elemento, para determinar cuándo debe finalizar el controlador. El parfor y el parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambos tenedores se ejecutan mientras la condición de iteración sea verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, la cantidad de elementos de proceso que se ejecutarán simultáneamente. En comparación con los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controladores paralelos representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control de flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar bifurcaciones y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en dichos lenguajes. Ejemplo de Proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe un cierto rango de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de números primos contenidos en este rango. La computación completa se realiza mediante un proceso que utiliza un controlador paralelo para iniciar y despachar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, con el fin de encontrar números primos. La porción del documento XML que describe los tipos de proceso y actividad se muestra a continuación. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware para Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> En primer lugar, se define un tipo de proceso que encuentra números primos, llamado FindPrimes. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, un rango de enteros en el que se deben encontrar números primos, la cantidad de primos a devolver y la cantidad de actividades a ejecutar para realizar este trabajo. Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades en paralelo. Itera desde 0 hasta getNumActs() - 1, lo cual determina el número de actividades, iniciando una actividad en paralelo en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subrangos del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, inicia una actividad en paralelo que encuentra números primos en un subrango específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos recién encontrados y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de primos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrango. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en el que debe encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se deben encontrar en todo el proceso y, pasado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados. Entre sus marcadores de CODE, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un número primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de números primos, insertados en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, y sale si es verdadero. La ventaja de utilizar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y monitorización automáticas, así como la capacidad de instanciar y despachar elementos del proceso solo cuando haya suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, pueden ser fácilmente compuestos y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al Grupo Servidor Grupo Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Gerente de Grupo Servidor Proceso Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Coordinador de Procesos Trabajador Máquina Virtual Java RMI Administrador de Actividades Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura en diferentes máquinas sobre la red, permitiendo una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallos. La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para la especificación y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de grid altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y programar actividades y controladores, y ejecutar actividades. 3.1 Arquitectura de Infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, que preservan su autonomía administrativa. Generalmente, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en redes locales o grupos de servidores, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) [11], y una Biblioteca de Tiempo de Ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gestor de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gestor de actividades (AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más administradores de grupo, pero solo uno actúa como principal y los demás como réplicas. Ellos son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas del grupo. Además, los gerentes de grupo mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios de grupo para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos, y programar y despachar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución de procesos y datos, y también cargar la especificación de procesos, utilizan repositorios de grupo. Finalmente, en varios nodos de grupo hay un administrador de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos de grupo, e informar sobre la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad pendientes, que contienen actividades por ejecutar. 3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar una arquitectura de red real, la infraestructura debe incluir varias, potencialmente todas, las redes locales, como lo hace Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales están conectados a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes de grupo (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se encarga de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses punteadas), con el fin de registrar las máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad correspondiente. Además, los gerentes de grupo se comunican con los gerentes de grupo de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad general a los gerentes de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gestores de actividades, respectivamente. 4. EJECUCIÓN DEL PROCESO En la arquitectura de cuadrícula propuesta, un proceso se especifica en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control; haciendo referencia a otros procesos y actividades; y pasando objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos específicos de proceso, actividad y controlador. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de procesos. Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe ser instanciado haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de procesos de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben ser pasados a él, y luego puede ser iniciado. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo de forma secuencial. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador de procesos puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de procesos en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, se pasa a un gestor de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores del proceso solicitan al gerente del grupo local encontrar máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio, coordinador del proceso o gerente de actividad requeridos, para ejecutar un elemento del proceso. Entonces, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguna, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina gestora de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local; y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos) si no hay servidores de procesos o trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local. Siguiendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupo intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de forma recursiva por todos los procesos coGM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Proceso PC Figura 4: ejecución del proceso FindPrimes por coordinadores que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, dado que los procesos están estructurados por la anidación de elementos de proceso, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente de forma jerárquica a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula según la disponibilidad y la localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la ejecución en áreas extensas, que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la red; y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, ya que los elementos fuertemente dependientes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cerca de ellos. Además, admite un monitoreo y control sencillos, gracias a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos. Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso 4.2 Retomando el ejemplo mostrado en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un rango determinado de números. Para resolver este problema, se crean una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador parfor. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra números primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso ejecutándose sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia del proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de procesos disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador parfor. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad FindPrimes. Si hay algún Administrador de Actividades (AM) disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay un administrador de actividad disponible, entonces el controlador entra en un estado de espera hasta que un administrador de actividad esté disponible o sea creado. De manera paralela, cada vez que una actividad finaliza, su resultado se envía de vuelta al coordinador del proceso, quien lo registra en el controlador de parfor. Entonces, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se han iniciado hayan terminado, y finaliza. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finaliza el proceso. 5. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Existen varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen apoyar la computación en malla, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de recursos distribuidos ampliamente en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar interfaces y servicios para la red, se ha definido la Arquitectura de Servicios de Red Abierta (OGSA). Las arquitecturas de rejilla generalmente tienen servicios que gestionan los recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en los disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen las dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en el orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar recuperación automática, y mejores algoritmos de distribución y programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de procesos y entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de actividades y su ejecución distribuida en un entorno de grid. Opera-G [3], al igual que WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de procesos similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y a los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona recuperación automática de la ejecución y un control limitado de la ejecución del proceso. Las arquitecturas previamente mencionadas y otras que llevan a cabo procesos sobre la red tienen una coordinación centralizada. Para superar esta limitación, sistemas como SwinDew [13] propusieron una ejecución de procesos ampliamente distribuida, en la que cada nodo sabe dónde ejecutar la siguiente actividad o unirse a actividades en un entorno de pares. En el área específica de distribución y programación de actividades, enfatizada en este trabajo, GridFlow [5] es notable. Utiliza una programación de dos niveles: global y local. A nivel local, cuenta con servicios que predicen la utilización de recursos informáticos y la duración de la actividad. Basándose en esta información, GridFlow emplea una técnica similar a PERT que intenta prever la hora de inicio y duración de la ejecución de las actividades para programarlas mejor con los recursos disponibles. La arquitectura propuesta en este documento, que abarca un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte de ejecución, es ampliamente descentralizada, a diferencia de WebFlow y Opera-G, siendo más escalable y tolerante a fallos. Pero, al igual que este último, está diseñado para respaldar la recuperación de la ejecución. En comparación con SwinDew, la arquitectura propuesta contiene coordinadores de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, los cuales coordinan procesos o partes de ellos de manera diferente a SwinDew, donde cada nodo tiene una vista limitada del proceso: solo la actividad que comienza a continuación. Esto facilita la supervisión y el control de los procesos. Finalmente, la infraestructura de soporte interrumpe el proceso y sus subprocesos para la ejecución en red, permitiendo a un grupo requerir a otro grupo para la coordinación y ejecución de elementos del proceso en nombre del primero. Esto es diferente de GridFlow, que puede ejecutar un proceso en un máximo de dos niveles, teniendo el nivel global como el único responsable de programar subprocesos en otros grupos. Esto puede limitar el rendimiento general de los procesos y hacer que el sistema sea menos escalable. CONCLUSIÓN Y TRABAJO FUTURO La computación en malla es un campo de investigación emergente que tiene como objetivo promover la computación distribuida y paralela en la amplia red de área de heterogéneos y autónomos dominios administrativos de manera transparente, similar a lo que Internet hace con el intercambio de datos. Hay varios productos que admiten la ejecución de tareas independientes en una cuadrícula, pero solo unos pocos admiten la ejecución de procesos con tareas interdependientes. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento propone un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte que permiten la ejecución de procesos estructurados de manera ampliamente distribuida y jerárquica. Esta infraestructura de soporte proporciona distribución automática, estructurada y recursiva de elementos de proceso sobre grupos de máquinas disponibles; mejor uso de recursos, debido a su creación bajo demanda de elementos de proceso; monitoreo y control de procesos fácil, debido a su naturaleza estructurada; y comunicación localizada entre elementos de proceso fuertemente dependientes, que se colocan bajo el mismo controlador. Estas características contribuyen a una mejor escalabilidad, tolerancia a fallos y control para la ejecución de procesos en la red. Además, abre puertas para mejores algoritmos de programación, mecanismos de recuperación y también esquemas de modificación dinámica. El próximo trabajo será la implementación de un mecanismo de recuperación que utiliza la ejecución y el estado de los datos de los procesos y controladores para recuperar la ejecución del proceso. Después de eso, es deseable avanzar en el algoritmo de programación para prever el uso de máquinas en los mismos u otros grupos y anticipar el tiempo de inicio de los elementos del proceso, con el fin de utilizar esta información para preasignar recursos y, así, obtener un mejor rendimiento en la ejecución del proceso. Finalmente, es interesante investigar esquemas de modificación dinámica de procesos en la red, con el fin de evolucionar y adaptar procesos a largo plazo al entorno de la red en constante cambio. 7.

Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas C.2.4 [Redes de Computadoras-Comunicación]: Sistemas Distribuidos-aplicaciones distribuidas Términos Generales Diseño, Rendimiento, Gestión, Algoritmos 1. La computación en malla es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la <br>descripción de procesos</br> y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación en malla propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la computación en malla y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura de computación en malla es muy similar al especificado en el Lenguaje de Ejecución de Procesos de Negocio (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente síncronos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basándose en construcciones estructuradas, a diferencia de BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un problema específico. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso; los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso padre; y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar el orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que en los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar el orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos del proceso a través de parámetros. Son pasados por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Los datos externos pueden ser accedidos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales u objetos distribuidos. 2.1 Controladores Los controladores son estructuras de control utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controladores secuenciales son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los demás imitan estructuras equivalentes de lenguajes de programación estructurada. De manera similar, los tipos paralelos son: par, parswitch, parfor y parwhile. Extienden los respectivos contrapartes secuenciales para permitir la ejecución en paralelo de los elementos del proceso. Todos los tipos de controladores paralelos bifurcan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego esperan a que cada ejecución termine. De hecho, contienen una bifurcación y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controladores paralelos contienen una condición de salida, evaluada cada vez que finaliza la ejecución de un elemento, para determinar cuándo debe finalizar el controlador. El parfor y el parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambos tenedores se ejecutan mientras la condición de iteración sea verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, la cantidad de elementos de proceso que se ejecutarán simultáneamente. En comparación con los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controladores paralelos representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control de flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar bifurcaciones y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en dichos lenguajes. Ejemplo de Proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe un cierto rango de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de números primos contenidos en este rango. La computación completa se realiza mediante un proceso que utiliza un controlador paralelo para iniciar y despachar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, con el fin de encontrar números primos. La porción del documento XML que describe los tipos de proceso y actividad se muestra a continuación. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware para Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> En primer lugar, se define un tipo de proceso que encuentra números primos, llamado FindPrimes. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, un rango de enteros en el que se deben encontrar números primos, la cantidad de primos a devolver y la cantidad de actividades a ejecutar para realizar este trabajo. Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades en paralelo. Itera desde 0 hasta getNumActs() - 1, lo cual determina el número de actividades, iniciando una actividad en paralelo en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subrangos del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, inicia una actividad en paralelo que encuentra números primos en un subrango específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos recién encontrados y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de primos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrango. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en el que debe encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se deben encontrar en todo el proceso y, pasado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados. Entre sus marcadores de CODE, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un número primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de números primos, insertados en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, y sale si es verdadero. La ventaja de utilizar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y monitorización automáticas, así como la capacidad de instanciar y despachar elementos del proceso solo cuando haya suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, pueden ser fácilmente compuestos y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al Grupo Servidor Grupo Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Gerente de Grupo Servidor Proceso Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Coordinador de Procesos Trabajador Máquina Virtual Java RMI Administrador de Actividades Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura en diferentes máquinas sobre la red, permitiendo una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallos. La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para la especificación y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de grid altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y programar actividades y controladores, y ejecutar actividades. 3.1 Arquitectura de Infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, que preservan su autonomía administrativa. Generalmente, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en redes locales o grupos de servidores, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) [11], y una Biblioteca de Tiempo de Ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gestor de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gestor de actividades (AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más administradores de grupo, pero solo uno actúa como principal y los demás como réplicas. Ellos son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas del grupo. Además, los gerentes de grupo mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios de grupo para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos, y programar y despachar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución de procesos y datos, y también cargar la especificación de procesos, utilizan repositorios de grupo. Finalmente, en varios nodos de grupo hay un administrador de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos de grupo, e informar sobre la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad pendientes, que contienen actividades por ejecutar. 3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar una arquitectura de red real, la infraestructura debe incluir varias, potencialmente todas, las redes locales, como lo hace Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales están conectados a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes de grupo (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se encarga de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses punteadas), con el fin de registrar las máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad correspondiente. Además, los gerentes de grupo se comunican con los gerentes de grupo de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad general a los gerentes de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gestores de actividades, respectivamente. 4. EJECUCIÓN DEL PROCESO En la arquitectura de cuadrícula propuesta, un proceso se especifica en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control; haciendo referencia a otros procesos y actividades; y pasando objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos específicos de proceso, actividad y controlador. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de procesos. Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe ser instanciado haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de procesos de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben ser pasados a él, y luego puede ser iniciado. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo de forma secuencial. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador de procesos puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de procesos en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, se pasa a un gestor de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores del proceso solicitan al gerente del grupo local encontrar máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio, coordinador del proceso o gerente de actividad requeridos, para ejecutar un elemento del proceso. Entonces, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguna, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina gestora de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local; y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos) si no hay servidores de procesos o trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local. Siguiendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupo intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de forma recursiva por todos los procesos coGM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Proceso PC Figura 4: ejecución del proceso FindPrimes por coordinadores que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, dado que los procesos están estructurados por la anidación de elementos de proceso, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente de forma jerárquica a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula según la disponibilidad y la localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la ejecución en áreas extensas, que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la red; y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, ya que los elementos fuertemente dependientes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cerca de ellos. Además, admite un monitoreo y control sencillos, gracias a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos. Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso 4.2 Retomando el ejemplo mostrado en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un rango determinado de números. Para resolver este problema, se crean una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador parfor. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra números primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso ejecutándose sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia del proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de procesos disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador parfor. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad FindPrimes. Si hay algún Administrador de Actividades (AM) disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay un administrador de actividad disponible, entonces el controlador entra en un estado de espera hasta que un administrador de actividad esté disponible o sea creado. De manera paralela, cada vez que una actividad finaliza, su resultado se envía de vuelta al coordinador del proceso, quien lo registra en el controlador de parfor. Entonces, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se han iniciado hayan terminado, y finaliza. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finaliza el proceso. 5. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Existen varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen apoyar la computación en malla, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de recursos distribuidos ampliamente en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar interfaces y servicios para la red, se ha definido la Arquitectura de Servicios de Red Abierta (OGSA). Las arquitecturas de rejilla generalmente tienen servicios que gestionan los recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en los disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen las dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en el orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar recuperación automática, y mejores algoritmos de distribución y programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de procesos y entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de actividades y su ejecución distribuida en un entorno de grid. Opera-G [3], al igual que WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de procesos similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y a los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona recuperación automática de la ejecución y un control limitado de la ejecución del proceso. Las arquitecturas previamente mencionadas y otras que llevan a cabo procesos sobre la red tienen una coordinación centralizada. Para superar esta limitación, sistemas como SwinDew [13] propusieron una ejecución de procesos ampliamente distribuida, en la que cada nodo sabe dónde ejecutar la siguiente actividad o unirse a actividades en un entorno de pares. En el área específica de distribución y programación de actividades, enfatizada en este trabajo, GridFlow [5] es notable. Utiliza una programación de dos niveles: global y local. A nivel local, cuenta con servicios que predicen la utilización de recursos informáticos y la duración de la actividad. Basándose en esta información, GridFlow emplea una técnica similar a PERT que intenta prever la hora de inicio y duración de la ejecución de las actividades para programarlas mejor con los recursos disponibles. La arquitectura propuesta en este documento, que abarca un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte de ejecución, es ampliamente descentralizada, a diferencia de WebFlow y Opera-G, siendo más escalable y tolerante a fallos. Pero, al igual que este último, está diseñado para respaldar la recuperación de la ejecución. En comparación con SwinDew, la arquitectura propuesta contiene coordinadores de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, los cuales coordinan procesos o partes de ellos de manera diferente a SwinDew, donde cada nodo tiene una vista limitada del proceso: solo la actividad que comienza a continuación. Esto facilita la supervisión y el control de los procesos. Finalmente, la infraestructura de soporte interrumpe el proceso y sus subprocesos para la ejecución en red, permitiendo a un grupo requerir a otro grupo para la coordinación y ejecución de elementos del proceso en nombre del primero. Esto es diferente de GridFlow, que puede ejecutar un proceso en un máximo de dos niveles, teniendo el nivel global como el único responsable de programar subprocesos en otros grupos. Esto puede limitar el rendimiento general de los procesos y hacer que el sistema sea menos escalable. CONCLUSIÓN Y TRABAJO FUTURO La computación en malla es un campo de investigación emergente que tiene como objetivo promover la computación distribuida y paralela en la amplia red de área de heterogéneos y autónomos dominios administrativos de manera transparente, similar a lo que Internet hace con el intercambio de datos. Hay varios productos que admiten la ejecución de tareas independientes en una cuadrícula, pero solo unos pocos admiten la ejecución de procesos con tareas interdependientes. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento propone un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte que permiten la ejecución de procesos estructurados de manera ampliamente distribuida y jerárquica. Esta infraestructura de soporte proporciona distribución automática, estructurada y recursiva de elementos de proceso sobre grupos de máquinas disponibles; mejor uso de recursos, debido a su creación bajo demanda de elementos de proceso; monitoreo y control de procesos fácil, debido a su naturaleza estructurada; y comunicación localizada entre elementos de proceso fuertemente dependientes, que se colocan bajo el mismo controlador. Estas características contribuyen a una mejor escalabilidad, tolerancia a fallos y control para la ejecución de procesos en la red. Además, abre puertas para mejores algoritmos de programación, mecanismos de recuperación y también esquemas de modificación dinámica. El próximo trabajo será la implementación de un mecanismo de recuperación que utiliza la ejecución y el estado de los datos de los procesos y controladores para recuperar la ejecución del proceso. Después de eso, es deseable avanzar en el algoritmo de programación para prever el uso de máquinas en los mismos u otros grupos y anticipar el tiempo de inicio de los elementos del proceso, con el fin de utilizar esta información para preasignar recursos y, así, obtener un mejor rendimiento en la ejecución del proceso. Finalmente, es interesante investigar esquemas de modificación dinámica de procesos en la red, con el fin de evolucionar y adaptar procesos a largo plazo al entorno de la red en constante cambio. 7.

                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",

Buzato Instituto de Computación Universidad Estatal de Campinas Campinas, Brasil buzato@ic.unicamp.br RESUMEN Grid es una infraestructura emergente utilizada para compartir recursos entre organizaciones virtuales de manera transparente y para proporcionar una potencia informática revolucionaria a bajo costo. Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas C.2.4 [Redes de Computadoras-Comunicación]: Sistemas Distribuidos-aplicaciones distribuidas Términos Generales Diseño, Rendimiento, Gestión, Algoritmos 1. La computación en malla es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación en malla propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la computación en malla y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura de computación en malla es muy similar al especificado en el Lenguaje de Ejecución de Procesos de Negocio (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente síncronos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basándose en construcciones estructuradas, a diferencia de BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un problema específico. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso; los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso padre; y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar el orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que en los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar el orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos del proceso a través de parámetros. Son pasados por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Los datos externos pueden ser accedidos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales u objetos distribuidos. 2.1 Controladores Los controladores son estructuras de control utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controladores secuenciales son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los demás imitan estructuras equivalentes de lenguajes de programación estructurada. De manera similar, los tipos paralelos son: par, parswitch, parfor y parwhile. Extienden los respectivos contrapartes secuenciales para permitir la ejecución en paralelo de los elementos del proceso. Todos los tipos de controladores paralelos bifurcan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego esperan a que cada ejecución termine. De hecho, contienen una bifurcación y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controladores paralelos contienen una condición de salida, evaluada cada vez que finaliza la ejecución de un elemento, para determinar cuándo debe finalizar el controlador. El parfor y el parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambos tenedores se ejecutan mientras la condición de iteración sea verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, la cantidad de elementos de proceso que se ejecutarán simultáneamente. En comparación con los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controladores paralelos representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control de flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar bifurcaciones y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en dichos lenguajes. Ejemplo de Proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe un cierto rango de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de números primos contenidos en este rango. La computación completa se realiza mediante un proceso que utiliza un controlador paralelo para iniciar y despachar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, con el fin de encontrar números primos. La porción del documento XML que describe los tipos de proceso y actividad se muestra a continuación. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware para Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> En primer lugar, se define un tipo de proceso que encuentra números primos, llamado FindPrimes. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, un rango de enteros en el que se deben encontrar números primos, la cantidad de primos a devolver y la cantidad de actividades a ejecutar para realizar este trabajo. Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades en paralelo. Itera desde 0 hasta getNumActs() - 1, lo cual determina el número de actividades, iniciando una actividad en paralelo en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subrangos del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, inicia una actividad en paralelo que encuentra números primos en un subrango específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos recién encontrados y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de primos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrango. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en el que debe encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se deben encontrar en todo el proceso y, pasado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados. Entre sus marcadores de CODE, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un número primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de números primos, insertados en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, y sale si es verdadero. La ventaja de utilizar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y monitorización automáticas, así como la capacidad de instanciar y despachar elementos del proceso solo cuando haya suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, pueden ser fácilmente compuestos y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al Grupo Servidor Grupo Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Gerente de Grupo Servidor Proceso Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Coordinador de Procesos Trabajador Máquina Virtual Java RMI Administrador de Actividades Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura en diferentes máquinas sobre la red, permitiendo una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallos. La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para la especificación y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de grid altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y programar actividades y controladores, y ejecutar actividades. 3.1 Arquitectura de Infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, que preservan su autonomía administrativa. Generalmente, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en redes locales o grupos de servidores, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) [11], y una Biblioteca de Tiempo de Ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gestor de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gestor de actividades (AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más administradores de grupo, pero solo uno actúa como principal y los demás como réplicas. Ellos son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas del grupo. Además, los gerentes de grupo mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios de grupo para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos, y programar y despachar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución de procesos y datos, y también cargar la especificación de procesos, utilizan repositorios de grupo. Finalmente, en varios nodos de grupo hay un administrador de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos de grupo, e informar sobre la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad pendientes, que contienen actividades por ejecutar. 3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar una arquitectura de red real, la infraestructura debe incluir varias, potencialmente todas, las redes locales, como lo hace Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales están conectados a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes de grupo (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se encarga de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses punteadas), con el fin de registrar las máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad correspondiente. Además, los gerentes de grupo se comunican con los gerentes de grupo de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad general a los gerentes de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gestores de actividades, respectivamente. 4. EJECUCIÓN DEL PROCESO En la arquitectura de cuadrícula propuesta, un proceso se especifica en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control; haciendo referencia a otros procesos y actividades; y pasando objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos específicos de proceso, actividad y controlador. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de procesos. Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe ser instanciado haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de procesos de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben ser pasados a él, y luego puede ser iniciado. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo de forma secuencial. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador de procesos puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de procesos en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, se pasa a un gestor de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores del proceso solicitan al gerente del grupo local encontrar máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio, coordinador del proceso o gerente de actividad requeridos, para ejecutar un elemento del proceso. Entonces, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguna, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina gestora de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local; y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos) si no hay servidores de procesos o trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local. Siguiendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupo intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de forma recursiva por todos los procesos coGM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Proceso PC Figura 4: ejecución del proceso FindPrimes por coordinadores que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, dado que los procesos están estructurados por la anidación de elementos de proceso, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente de forma jerárquica a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula según la disponibilidad y la localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la ejecución en áreas extensas, que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la red; y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, ya que los elementos fuertemente dependientes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cerca de ellos. Además, admite un monitoreo y control sencillos, gracias a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos. Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso 4.2 Retomando el ejemplo mostrado en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un rango determinado de números. Para resolver este problema, se crean una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador parfor. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra números primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso ejecutándose sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia del proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de procesos disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador parfor. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad FindPrimes. Si hay algún Administrador de Actividades (AM) disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay un administrador de actividad disponible, entonces el controlador entra en un estado de espera hasta que un administrador de actividad esté disponible o sea creado. De manera paralela, cada vez que una actividad finaliza, su resultado se envía de vuelta al coordinador del proceso, quien lo registra en el controlador de parfor. Entonces, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se han iniciado hayan terminado, y finaliza. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finaliza el proceso. 5. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Existen varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen apoyar la computación en malla, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de recursos distribuidos ampliamente en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar interfaces y servicios para la red, se ha definido la Arquitectura de Servicios de Red Abierta (OGSA). Las arquitecturas de rejilla generalmente tienen servicios que gestionan los recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en los disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen las dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en el orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar recuperación automática, y mejores algoritmos de distribución y programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de procesos y entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de actividades y su ejecución distribuida en un entorno de grid. Opera-G [3], al igual que WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de procesos similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y a los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona recuperación automática de la ejecución y un control limitado de la ejecución del proceso. Las arquitecturas previamente mencionadas y otras que llevan a cabo procesos sobre la red tienen una coordinación centralizada. Para superar esta limitación, sistemas como SwinDew [13] propusieron una ejecución de procesos ampliamente distribuida, en la que cada nodo sabe dónde ejecutar la siguiente actividad o unirse a actividades en un entorno de pares. En el área específica de distribución y programación de actividades, enfatizada en este trabajo, GridFlow [5] es notable. Utiliza una programación de dos niveles: global y local. A nivel local, cuenta con servicios que predicen la utilización de recursos informáticos y la duración de la actividad. Basándose en esta información, GridFlow emplea una técnica similar a PERT que intenta prever la hora de inicio y duración de la ejecución de las actividades para programarlas mejor con los recursos disponibles. La arquitectura propuesta en este documento, que abarca un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte de ejecución, es ampliamente descentralizada, a diferencia de WebFlow y Opera-G, siendo más escalable y tolerante a fallos. Pero, al igual que este último, está diseñado para respaldar la recuperación de la ejecución. En comparación con SwinDew, la arquitectura propuesta contiene coordinadores de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, los cuales coordinan procesos o partes de ellos de manera diferente a SwinDew, donde cada nodo tiene una vista limitada del proceso: solo la actividad que comienza a continuación. Esto facilita la supervisión y el control de los procesos. Finalmente, la infraestructura de soporte interrumpe el proceso y sus subprocesos para la ejecución en red, permitiendo a un grupo requerir a otro grupo para la coordinación y ejecución de elementos del proceso en nombre del primero. Esto es diferente de GridFlow, que puede ejecutar un proceso en un máximo de dos niveles, teniendo el nivel global como el único responsable de programar subprocesos en otros grupos. Esto puede limitar el rendimiento general de los procesos y hacer que el sistema sea menos escalable. CONCLUSIÓN Y TRABAJO FUTURO La computación en malla es un campo de investigación emergente que tiene como objetivo promover la computación distribuida y paralela en la amplia red de área de heterogéneos y autónomos dominios administrativos de manera transparente, similar a lo que Internet hace con el intercambio de datos. Hay varios productos que admiten la ejecución de tareas independientes en una cuadrícula, pero solo unos pocos admiten la ejecución de procesos con tareas interdependientes. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento propone un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte que permiten la ejecución de procesos estructurados de manera ampliamente distribuida y jerárquica. Esta infraestructura de soporte proporciona distribución automática, estructurada y recursiva de elementos de proceso sobre grupos de máquinas disponibles; mejor uso de recursos, debido a su creación bajo demanda de elementos de proceso; monitoreo y control de procesos fácil, debido a su naturaleza estructurada; y comunicación localizada entre elementos de proceso fuertemente dependientes, que se colocan bajo el mismo controlador. Estas características contribuyen a una mejor escalabilidad, tolerancia a fallos y control para la ejecución de procesos en la red. Además, abre puertas para mejores algoritmos de programación, mecanismos de recuperación y también esquemas de modificación dinámica. El próximo trabajo será la implementación de un mecanismo de recuperación que utiliza la ejecución y el estado de los datos de los procesos y controladores para recuperar la ejecución del proceso. Después de eso, es deseable avanzar en el algoritmo de programación para prever el uso de máquinas en los mismos u otros grupos y anticipar el tiempo de inicio de los elementos del proceso, con el fin de utilizar esta información para preasignar recursos y, así, obtener un mejor rendimiento en la ejecución del proceso. Finalmente, es interesante investigar esquemas de modificación dinámica de procesos en la red, con el fin de evolucionar y adaptar procesos a largo plazo al entorno de la red en constante cambio. 7.

Buzato Instituto de Computación Universidad Estatal de Campinas Campinas, Brasil buzato@ic.unicamp.br RESUMEN Grid es una infraestructura emergente utilizada para compartir recursos entre organizaciones virtuales de manera transparente y para proporcionar una potencia informática revolucionaria a bajo costo. Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas C.2.4 [Redes de Computadoras-Comunicación]: Sistemas Distribuidos-aplicaciones distribuidas Términos Generales Diseño, Rendimiento, Gestión, Algoritmos 1. La computación en malla es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación en malla propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la computación en malla y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura de computación en malla es muy similar al especificado en el Lenguaje de Ejecución de Procesos de Negocio (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente síncronos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basándose en construcciones estructuradas, a diferencia de BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un problema específico. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso; los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso padre; y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar el orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que en los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar el orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos del proceso a través de parámetros. Son pasados por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Los datos externos pueden ser accedidos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales u objetos distribuidos. 2.1 Controladores Los controladores son estructuras de control utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controladores secuenciales son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los demás imitan estructuras equivalentes de lenguajes de programación estructurada. De manera similar, los tipos paralelos son: par, parswitch, parfor y parwhile. Extienden los respectivos contrapartes secuenciales para permitir la ejecución en paralelo de los elementos del proceso. Todos los tipos de controladores paralelos bifurcan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego esperan a que cada ejecución termine. De hecho, contienen una bifurcación y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controladores paralelos contienen una condición de salida, evaluada cada vez que finaliza la ejecución de un elemento, para determinar cuándo debe finalizar el controlador. El parfor y el parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambos tenedores se ejecutan mientras la condición de iteración sea verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, la cantidad de elementos de proceso que se ejecutarán simultáneamente. En comparación con los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controladores paralelos representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control de flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar bifurcaciones y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en dichos lenguajes. Ejemplo de Proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe un cierto rango de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de números primos contenidos en este rango. La computación completa se realiza mediante un proceso que utiliza un controlador paralelo para iniciar y despachar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, con el fin de encontrar números primos.

Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades en paralelo. Itera desde 0 hasta getNumActs() - 1, lo cual determina el número de actividades, iniciando una actividad en paralelo en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subrangos del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, inicia una actividad en paralelo que encuentra números primos en un subrango específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos recién encontrados y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de primos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrango. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en el que debe encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se deben encontrar en todo el proceso y, pasado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados. Entre sus marcadores de CODE, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un número primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de números primos, insertados en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, y sale si es verdadero. La ventaja de utilizar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y monitorización automáticas, así como la capacidad de instanciar y despachar elementos del proceso solo cuando haya suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, pueden ser fácilmente compuestos y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al Grupo Servidor Grupo Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Gerente de Grupo Servidor Proceso Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Coordinador de Procesos Trabajador Máquina Virtual Java RMI Administrador de Actividades Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura en diferentes máquinas sobre la red, permitiendo una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallos. La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para la especificación y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de grid altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y programar actividades y controladores, y ejecutar actividades. 3.1 Arquitectura de Infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, que preservan su autonomía administrativa. Generalmente, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en redes locales o grupos de servidores, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) [11], y una Biblioteca de Tiempo de Ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gestor de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gestor de actividades (AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más administradores de grupo, pero solo uno actúa como principal y los demás como réplicas. Ellos son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas del grupo. Además, los gerentes de grupo mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios de grupo para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos, y programar y despachar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución de procesos y datos, y también cargar la especificación de procesos, utilizan repositorios de grupo. Finalmente, en varios nodos de grupo hay un administrador de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos de grupo, e informar sobre la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad pendientes, que contienen actividades por ejecutar. 3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar una <br>arquitectura de red</br> real, la infraestructura debe incluir varias, potencialmente todas, las redes locales, como lo hace Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales están conectados a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes de grupo (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se encarga de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses punteadas), con el fin de registrar las máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad correspondiente. Además, los gerentes de grupo se comunican con los gerentes de grupo de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad general a los gerentes de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gestores de actividades, respectivamente. 4. EJECUCIÓN DEL PROCESO En la <br>arquitectura de cuadrícula</br> propuesta, un proceso se especifica en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control; haciendo referencia a otros procesos y actividades; y pasando objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos específicos de proceso, actividad y controlador. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de procesos. Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe ser instanciado haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de procesos de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben ser pasados a él, y luego puede ser iniciado. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo de forma secuencial. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador de procesos puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de procesos en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, se pasa a un gestor de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores del proceso solicitan al gerente del grupo local encontrar máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio, coordinador del proceso o gerente de actividad requeridos, para ejecutar un elemento del proceso. Entonces, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguna, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina gestora de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local; y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos) si no hay servidores de procesos o trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local. Siguiendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupo intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de forma recursiva por todos los procesos coGM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Proceso PC Figura 4: ejecución del proceso FindPrimes por coordinadores que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, dado que los procesos están estructurados por la anidación de elementos de proceso, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente de forma jerárquica a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula según la disponibilidad y la localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la ejecución en áreas extensas, que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la red; y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, ya que los elementos fuertemente dependientes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cerca de ellos. Además, admite un monitoreo y control sencillos, gracias a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos. Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso 4.2 Retomando el ejemplo mostrado en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un rango determinado de números. Para resolver este problema, se crean una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador parfor. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra números primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso ejecutándose sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia del proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de procesos disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador parfor. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad FindPrimes. Si hay algún Administrador de Actividades (AM) disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay un administrador de actividad disponible, entonces el controlador entra en un estado de espera hasta que un administrador de actividad esté disponible o sea creado. De manera paralela, cada vez que una actividad finaliza, su resultado se envía de vuelta al coordinador del proceso, quien lo registra en el controlador de parfor. Entonces, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se han iniciado hayan terminado, y finaliza. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finaliza el proceso. 5. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Existen varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen apoyar la computación en malla, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de recursos distribuidos ampliamente en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar interfaces y servicios para la red, se ha definido la Arquitectura de Servicios de Red Abierta (OGSA). Las arquitecturas de rejilla generalmente tienen servicios que gestionan los recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en los disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen las dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en el orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar recuperación automática, y mejores algoritmos de distribución y programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de procesos y entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de actividades y su ejecución distribuida en un entorno de grid. Opera-G [3], al igual que WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de procesos similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y a los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona recuperación automática de la ejecución y un control limitado de la ejecución del proceso. Las arquitecturas previamente mencionadas y otras que llevan a cabo procesos sobre la red tienen una coordinación centralizada. Para superar esta limitación, sistemas como SwinDew [13] propusieron una ejecución de procesos ampliamente distribuida, en la que cada nodo sabe dónde ejecutar la siguiente actividad o unirse a actividades en un entorno de pares. En el área específica de distribución y programación de actividades, enfatizada en este trabajo, GridFlow [5] es notable. Utiliza una programación de dos niveles: global y local. A nivel local, cuenta con servicios que predicen la utilización de recursos informáticos y la duración de la actividad. Basándose en esta información, GridFlow emplea una técnica similar a PERT que intenta prever la hora de inicio y duración de la ejecución de las actividades para programarlas mejor con los recursos disponibles. La arquitectura propuesta en este documento, que abarca un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte de ejecución, es ampliamente descentralizada, a diferencia de WebFlow y Opera-G, siendo más escalable y tolerante a fallos. Pero, al igual que este último, está diseñado para respaldar la recuperación de la ejecución. En comparación con SwinDew, la arquitectura propuesta contiene coordinadores de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, los cuales coordinan procesos o partes de ellos de manera diferente a SwinDew, donde cada nodo tiene una vista limitada del proceso: solo la actividad que comienza a continuación. Esto facilita la supervisión y el control de los procesos. Finalmente, la infraestructura de soporte interrumpe el proceso y sus subprocesos para la ejecución en red, permitiendo a un grupo requerir a otro grupo para la coordinación y ejecución de elementos del proceso en nombre del primero. Esto es diferente de GridFlow, que puede ejecutar un proceso en un máximo de dos niveles, teniendo el nivel global como el único responsable de programar subprocesos en otros grupos. Esto puede limitar el rendimiento general de los procesos y hacer que el sistema sea menos escalable. CONCLUSIÓN Y TRABAJO FUTURO La computación en malla es un campo de investigación emergente que tiene como objetivo promover la computación distribuida y paralela en la amplia red de área de heterogéneos y autónomos dominios administrativos de manera transparente, similar a lo que Internet hace con el intercambio de datos. Hay varios productos que admiten la ejecución de tareas independientes en una cuadrícula, pero solo unos pocos admiten la ejecución de procesos con tareas interdependientes. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento propone un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte que permiten la ejecución de procesos estructurados de manera ampliamente distribuida y jerárquica. Esta infraestructura de soporte proporciona distribución automática, estructurada y recursiva de elementos de proceso sobre grupos de máquinas disponibles; mejor uso de recursos, debido a su creación bajo demanda de elementos de proceso; monitoreo y control de procesos fácil, debido a su naturaleza estructurada; y comunicación localizada entre elementos de proceso fuertemente dependientes, que se colocan bajo el mismo controlador. Estas características contribuyen a una mejor escalabilidad, tolerancia a fallos y control para la ejecución de procesos en la red. Además, abre puertas para mejores algoritmos de programación, mecanismos de recuperación y también esquemas de modificación dinámica. El próximo trabajo será la implementación de un mecanismo de recuperación que utiliza la ejecución y el estado de los datos de los procesos y controladores para recuperar la ejecución del proceso. Después de eso, es deseable avanzar en el algoritmo de programación para prever el uso de máquinas en los mismos u otros grupos y anticipar el tiempo de inicio de los elementos del proceso, con el fin de utilizar esta información para preasignar recursos y, así, obtener un mejor rendimiento en la ejecución del proceso. Finalmente, es interesante investigar esquemas de modificación dinámica de procesos en la red, con el fin de evolucionar y adaptar procesos a largo plazo al entorno de la red en constante cambio. 7.

Buzato Instituto de Computación Universidad Estatal de Campinas Campinas, Brasil buzato@ic.unicamp.br RESUMEN Grid es una infraestructura emergente utilizada para compartir recursos entre organizaciones virtuales de manera transparente y para proporcionar una potencia informática revolucionaria a bajo costo. Hoy en día existen docenas de productos académicos y comerciales que permiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas en rejillas, pero pocos productos admiten la realización de procesos de larga duración de manera distribuida. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando los nodos disponibles en un entorno de red amplia. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de actividades, así como la fácil supervisión y control del proceso. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas C.2.4 [Redes de Computadoras-Comunicación]: Sistemas Distribuidos-aplicaciones distribuidas Términos Generales Diseño, Rendimiento, Gestión, Algoritmos 1. La computación en malla es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de amplia área a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporcionar un gran poder de computación a través de esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera fluida [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona el intercambio de recursos de datos, la gestión de la utilización de recursos computacionales y la ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de grid existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran sus interdependencias como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia limita mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación automática de la ejecución. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admitan la ejecución de procesos en la red. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de dependencias de control y datos. Entre ellos, WebFlow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos; Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación y control de ejecución, GridFlow [5] se centra en algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividad, y SwinDew [13] soporta una ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes peer-to-peer. Sin embargo, dichas infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación centralizados por proceso [1, 3, 5], o completamente distribuidos, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales limitaciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurada para la descripción de procesos y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución de procesos. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de actividades controlada y contextualizada. Complementariamente, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso especificado para distribuir y programar actividades fuertemente dependientes como una unidad, permitiendo un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallos, y proporcionando comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamados X avantes, se encuentran en proceso de implementación con el fin de mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos principales ventajas: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, pero de manera controlada, estructurada y localizada. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación, y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación en malla propuesto. La sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este artículo abarcando las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área de la computación en malla y enumera algunos trabajos futuros. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura de computación en malla es muy similar al especificado en el Lenguaje de Ejecución de Procesos de Negocio (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente síncronos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basándose en construcciones estructuradas, a diferencia de BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un problema específico. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso; los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso padre; y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar el orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que en los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar el orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos del proceso a través de parámetros. Son pasados por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Los datos externos pueden ser accedidos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales u objetos distribuidos. 2.1 Controladores Los controladores son estructuras de control utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controladores secuenciales son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los demás imitan estructuras equivalentes de lenguajes de programación estructurada. De manera similar, los tipos paralelos son: par, parswitch, parfor y parwhile. Extienden los respectivos contrapartes secuenciales para permitir la ejecución en paralelo de los elementos del proceso. Todos los tipos de controladores paralelos bifurcan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego esperan a que cada ejecución termine. De hecho, contienen una bifurcación y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controladores paralelos contienen una condición de salida, evaluada cada vez que finaliza la ejecución de un elemento, para determinar cuándo debe finalizar el controlador. El parfor y el parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambos tenedores se ejecutan mientras la condición de iteración sea verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, la cantidad de elementos de proceso que se ejecutarán simultáneamente. En comparación con los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controladores paralelos representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control de flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar bifurcaciones y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en dichos lenguajes. Ejemplo de Proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe un cierto rango de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de números primos contenidos en este rango. La computación completa se realiza mediante un proceso que utiliza un controlador paralelo para iniciar y despachar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, con el fin de encontrar números primos. La porción del documento XML que describe los tipos de proceso y actividad se muestra a continuación. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware para Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> En primer lugar, se define un tipo de proceso que encuentra números primos, llamado FindPrimes. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, un rango de enteros en el que se deben encontrar números primos, la cantidad de primos a devolver y la cantidad de actividades a ejecutar para realizar este trabajo. Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades en paralelo. Itera desde 0 hasta getNumActs() - 1, lo cual determina el número de actividades, iniciando una actividad en paralelo en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subrangos del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, inicia una actividad en paralelo que encuentra números primos en un subrango específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos recién encontrados y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de primos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrango. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en el que debe encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se deben encontrar en todo el proceso y, pasado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados. Entre sus marcadores de CODE, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un número primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si se ha alcanzado el número requerido de números primos, insertados en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, y sale si es verdadero. La ventaja de utilizar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y monitorización automáticas, así como la capacidad de instanciar y despachar elementos del proceso solo cuando haya suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, pueden ser fácilmente compuestos y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al Grupo Servidor Grupo Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Gerente de Grupo Servidor Proceso Máquina Virtual Java RMI JDBC Coordinador de Procesos Trabajador Máquina Virtual Java RMI Administrador de Actividades Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura en diferentes máquinas sobre la red, permitiendo una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallos. La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para la especificación y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de grid altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y programar actividades y controladores, y ejecutar actividades. 3.1 Arquitectura de Infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, que preservan su autonomía administrativa. Generalmente, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en redes locales o grupos de servidores, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) [11], y una Biblioteca de Tiempo de Ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gestor de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gestor de actividades (AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más administradores de grupo, pero solo uno actúa como principal y los demás como réplicas. Ellos son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas del grupo. Además, los gerentes de grupo mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios de grupo para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos, y programar y despachar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución de procesos y datos, y también cargar la especificación de procesos, utilizan repositorios de grupo. Finalmente, en varios nodos de grupo hay un administrador de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos de grupo, e informar sobre la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad pendientes, que contienen actividades por ejecutar. 3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar una arquitectura de red real, la infraestructura debe incluir varias, potencialmente todas, las redes locales, como lo hace Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales están conectados a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes de grupo (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se encarga de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses punteadas), con el fin de registrar las máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad correspondiente. Además, los gerentes de grupo se comunican con los gerentes de grupo de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad general a los gerentes de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gestores de actividades, respectivamente. 4. EJECUCIÓN DEL PROCESO En la arquitectura de cuadrícula propuesta, un proceso se especifica en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control; haciendo referencia a otros procesos y actividades; y pasando objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos específicos de proceso, actividad y controlador. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de procesos. Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe ser instanciado haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de procesos de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben ser pasados a él, y luego puede ser iniciado. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo de forma secuencial. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador de procesos puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de procesos en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, se pasa a un gestor de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores del proceso solicitan al gerente del grupo local encontrar máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio, coordinador del proceso o gerente de actividad requeridos, para ejecutar un elemento del proceso. Entonces, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguna, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina gestora de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local; y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos) si no hay servidores de procesos o trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local. Siguiendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupo intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de forma recursiva por todos los procesos coGM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Actividad AM FindPrimes Proceso PC Figura 4: ejecución del proceso FindPrimes por coordinadores que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, dado que los procesos están estructurados por la anidación de elementos de proceso, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente de forma jerárquica a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula según la disponibilidad y la localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la ejecución en áreas extensas, que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la red; y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, ya que los elementos fuertemente dependientes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cerca de ellos. Además, admite un monitoreo y control sencillos, gracias a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos. Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso 4.2 Retomando el ejemplo mostrado en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un rango determinado de números. Para resolver este problema, se crean una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador parfor. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra números primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso ejecutándose sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia del proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de procesos disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador parfor. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad FindPrimes. Si hay algún Administrador de Actividades (AM) disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay un administrador de actividad disponible, entonces el controlador entra en un estado de espera hasta que un administrador de actividad esté disponible o sea creado. De manera paralela, cada vez que una actividad finaliza, su resultado se envía de vuelta al coordinador del proceso, quien lo registra en el controlador de parfor. Entonces, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se han iniciado hayan terminado, y finaliza. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finaliza el proceso. 5. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Existen varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen apoyar la computación en malla, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de recursos distribuidos ampliamente en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar interfaces y servicios para la red, se ha definido la Arquitectura de Servicios de Red Abierta (OGSA). Las arquitecturas de rejilla generalmente tienen servicios que gestionan los recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en los disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen las dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en el orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar recuperación automática, y mejores algoritmos de distribución y programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de procesos y entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de actividades y su ejecución distribuida en un entorno de grid. Opera-G [3], al igual que WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de procesos similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y a los lenguajes de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona recuperación automática de la ejecución y un control limitado de la ejecución del proceso. Las arquitecturas previamente mencionadas y otras que llevan a cabo procesos sobre la red tienen una coordinación centralizada. Para superar esta limitación, sistemas como SwinDew [13] propusieron una ejecución de procesos ampliamente distribuida, en la que cada nodo sabe dónde ejecutar la siguiente actividad o unirse a actividades en un entorno de pares. En el área específica de distribución y programación de actividades, enfatizada en este trabajo, GridFlow [5] es notable. Utiliza una programación de dos niveles: global y local. A nivel local, cuenta con servicios que predicen la utilización de recursos informáticos y la duración de la actividad. Basándose en esta información, GridFlow emplea una técnica similar a PERT que intenta prever la hora de inicio y duración de la ejecución de las actividades para programarlas mejor con los recursos disponibles. La arquitectura propuesta en este documento, que abarca un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte de ejecución, es ampliamente descentralizada, a diferencia de WebFlow y Opera-G, siendo más escalable y tolerante a fallos. Pero, al igual que este último, está diseñado para respaldar la recuperación de la ejecución. En comparación con SwinDew, la arquitectura propuesta contiene coordinadores de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, los cuales coordinan procesos o partes de ellos de manera diferente a SwinDew, donde cada nodo tiene una vista limitada del proceso: solo la actividad que comienza a continuación. Esto facilita la supervisión y el control de los procesos. Finalmente, la infraestructura de soporte interrumpe el proceso y sus subprocesos para la ejecución en red, permitiendo a un grupo requerir a otro grupo para la coordinación y ejecución de elementos del proceso en nombre del primero. Esto es diferente de GridFlow, que puede ejecutar un proceso en un máximo de dos niveles, teniendo el nivel global como el único responsable de programar subprocesos en otros grupos. Esto puede limitar el rendimiento general de los procesos y hacer que el sistema sea menos escalable. CONCLUSIÓN Y TRABAJO FUTURO La computación en malla es un campo de investigación emergente que tiene como objetivo promover la computación distribuida y paralela en la amplia red de área de heterogéneos y autónomos dominios administrativos de manera transparente, similar a lo que Internet hace con el intercambio de datos. Hay varios productos que admiten la ejecución de tareas independientes en una cuadrícula, pero solo unos pocos admiten la ejecución de procesos con tareas interdependientes. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento propone un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte que permiten la ejecución de procesos estructurados de manera ampliamente distribuida y jerárquica. Esta infraestructura de soporte proporciona distribución automática, estructurada y recursiva de elementos de proceso sobre grupos de máquinas disponibles; mejor uso de recursos, debido a su creación bajo demanda de elementos de proceso; monitoreo y control de procesos fácil, debido a su naturaleza estructurada; y comunicación localizada entre elementos de proceso fuertemente dependientes, que se colocan bajo el mismo controlador. Estas características contribuyen a una mejor escalabilidad, tolerancia a fallos y control para la ejecución de procesos en la red. Además, abre puertas para mejores algoritmos de programación, mecanismos de recuperación y también esquemas de modificación dinámica. El próximo trabajo será la implementación de un mecanismo de recuperación que utiliza la ejecución y el estado de los datos de los procesos y controladores para recuperar la ejecución del proceso. Después de eso, es deseable avanzar en el <br>algoritmo de programación</br> para prever el uso de máquinas en los mismos u otros grupos y anticipar el tiempo de inicio de los elementos del proceso, con el fin de utilizar esta información para preasignar recursos y, así, obtener un mejor rendimiento en la ejecución del proceso. Finalmente, es interesante investigar esquemas de modificación dinámica de procesos en la red, con el fin de evolucionar y adaptar procesos a largo plazo al entorno de la red en constante cambio. 7.

                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",

                "The advantage of using controllers is the possibility of the support infrastructure determines the point of execution the process is in, allowing automatic recovery and monitoring, and also the capability of instantiating and dispatching process elements only when there are enough computing resources available, reducing unnecessary overhead.",
                "Besides, due to its structured nature, they can be easily composed and the support infrastructure can take advantage of this in order to distribute hierarchically the nested controllers to Group Server Group Java Virtual Machine RMI JDBC Group Manager Process Server Java Virtual Machine RMI JDBC Process Coordinator Worker Java Virtual Machine RMI Activity Manager Repository Figure 2: Infrastructure architecture different machines over the grid, allowing enhanced scalability and fault-tolerance. 3.",

                "It has services to monitor availability of resources in the grid, to interpret processes and schedule activities and controllers, and to execute activities. 3.1 Infrastructure Architecture The support infrastructure architecture is composed of groups of machines and data repositories, which preserves its administrative autonomy.",
                "Generally, localized machines and repositories, such as in local networks or clusters, form a group.",
                "Each machine in a group must have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) [11], and a Java Runtime Library, besides a combination of the following grid support services: group manager (GM), process coordinator (PC) and activity manager (AM).",
                "This combination determines what kind of group node it represents: a group server, a process server, or simply a worker (see Figure 2).",
                "In a group there are one or more group managers, but only one acts as primary and the others, as replicas.",

                "They are responsible to instantiate and execute processes and controllers, select resources, and schedule and dispatch activities to workers.",
                "In order to persist and recover process execution and data, and also load process specification, they use group repositories.",
                "Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity manager.",
                "It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers.",
                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",
                "Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM Figure 3: Inter-group relationships connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group managers (see Figure 3).",
                "Each group manager deals with requests of its group (represented by dashed ellipses), in order to register local machines and maintain correspondent availability.",
                "Additionally, group managers communicate to group managers of other groups.",
                "Each group manager exports coarse availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and also receives requests from other external services to furnish detailed availability information.",
                "In this way, if there are resources available in external groups, it is possible to send processes, controllers and activities to these groups in order to execute them in external process coordinators and activity managers, respectively. 4.",
                "PROCESS EXECUTION In the proposed grid architecture, a process is specified in XML, using controllers to determine control flow; referencing other processes and activities; and passing objects to their parameters in order to define data flow.",
                "After specified, the process is compiled in a set of classes, which represent specific process, activity and controller types.",
                "At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group.",
                "Also, the initial parameters must be passed to it, and then it can be started.",
                "The process coordinator carries out the process by executing the process elements included in its body sequentially.",

                "Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine.",
                "Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element.",
                "Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid.",
                "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",
                "Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers.",

                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
                "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",

                "Aiming to standardize interfaces and services to grid, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) [7] has been defined.",
                "The grid architectures generally have services that manage computing resources and distribute the execution of independent tasks on available ones.",
                "However, emerging architectures maintain task dependencies and automatically execute tasks in a correct order.",
                "They take advantage of these dependencies to provide automatic recovery, and better distribution and scheduling algorithms.",
                "Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment.",
                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing.",
                "There are several products that support execution of independent tasks over grid, but only a few supports the execution of processes with interdependent tasks.",
                "In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that allow the execution of structured processes in a widely distributed and hierarchical manner.",
                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
                "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
                "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",
